18511,"2010m11","Thanks, Patrick.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Half Yearly Results Presentation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is our agenda for today.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I'm going to give a short introduction, and then Julia will present a financial review of the first half year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Cressida Hogg, who's our managing partner of the Infrastructure business, will then give you an overview of this important part of 3i's investment activity.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And finally, I'll review our strategic progress and cover the outlook and priorities for the next six months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I said in the statement this morning, we've increased momentum throughout the business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our portfolio has delivered a good performance, achieving a gross portfolio return of 8.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7% for the six months to the 30th of September.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Total return was lower at 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","8%, although NAV growth over the last 12 months is over 15%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've made good progress in terms of strategic development, and we now have three strong platforms for growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In the last few presentations to you, I've talked about planning and organizing for growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've now moved into the delivery phase.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I'll give you more detail on this later.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But before that, Julia will review our financial performance.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So if I take your question on provisions and impairments, I mean, clearly, you're right.",1781
18511,"2010m11","If you compare the numbers to last year, then it doesn't look like a particularly good shift.",1781
18511,"2010m11","What it would say is clearly last year had almost the benefit of the previous year where we've had some very, very significant provisions and impairment.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So I'd say last year was unusually low.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this year, the provision level is 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","1% of opening portfolio value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","That's an unusual sort of amount.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In terms of the underlying movement that's in there, it's a small number of assets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There's no particular themes that I can draw out for you that's spread across the business lines, that's spread across sectors and spread across geographies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The specific factors to particular investments and don't actually indicate any underlying trend the overall portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And then in terms of cash for the period, I mean, clearly there are, as Michael has said, there was a number of transactions that are being well trailed in the market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We're not trying to give you a specific number where expect cash to be because we would like actually to be investing in the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So it's realistic to assume that there will be some significant realizations coming through.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But in terms where net debt's going to be would be putting and some decent amount of investment in the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Some of that will come down to timing.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Where we will talk about smaller numbers of large transactions, we can get quite different numbers coming over the year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So I would hope that we would have investment, but clearly number of realizations going through.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Well, I think what we're looking to do overall is deliver 15% returns to shareholders.",1781
18511,"2010m11","That will come in a combination of forms, will come from the earnings growth on the portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We typically do see a step-up when we sell assets open above the carrying value, so that gives an additional boost to return; and of course, from the income streams from managing third-party assets, which clearly will start to rise as we incorporate the Debt Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I think if you look at this half year's performance, I mean, the way I try and look at this is to sort of x out multiple movement, both up and down, whether half-year period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And so I think what they're all about in terms of their consistency delivery with that delivery of that trend.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So the MWM transaction to bring in about GBP 180 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So as Michael said on his slide, that's GBP 224 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thanks, Cressida.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I'd now like to update you on our strategic progress and then talk about the outlook on our priorities for the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The four quarter elements of our strategy, as set out on the slide, are also described in detail on our IR website as well as in our annual report.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And today, I want to mainly focus on two aspects of this strategy, investing and growing the business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me start with investment.",1781
18511,"2010m11","High-quality new investment is important to future value growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But the environment for making good investments has been challenging.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me explain what I mean by challenging.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Volume of private equity activity across Europe has been very low.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The number of transactions for both growth and buyouts is a third the level than it was in 2007.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But the funds available for investment continue to be very high, with the consequence that most transactions in Europe have been very at high prices so we have an overhang of capital in our industry.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now in this environment, we've taking a measured and highly selective approach to the market and focused only on making investments where we feel we can make a significant impact on the performance of a particular company.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Trescal is a very good example of such a situation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It's a classic mid-market buyout in terms of size and profile.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Trescal is a French-based International business, providing calibration services for a wide range of industrial companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It has revenue of EUR 110 million and operates 60 laboratories in 11 countries.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We were able to invest through our strong relationship with the management, our experience having made several successful investments in the sector and the involvement of from our business leaders network.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The investment case is based on four components.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Firstly, Trescal is in a growing sector, as many of its customers are looking to outsource testing and measurement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Secondly, because capital investment is required in building a company like Trescal, there are significant barriers to entry.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thirdly, through our active partnership analysis, we and management believe there's considerable opportunity for operational improvement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And finally, given its market position and a highly fragmented sector, there's a real opportunity for buy and build.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now increasing the level of investment is only one way to grow 3i's value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In addition, we must also continue to take every opportunity to grow the value of our existing portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Earnings growth in our portfolio is being good.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And one of the ways that our portfolio companies have been delivering this is to find opportunities in developing markets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MWM is a very good example of this.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MWM is a GBP 360 million euro buyout from Deutsche AG 2007.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And it's a leading manufacturer of engines that are used to produce power.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now a typical use for an MWM engine is generating power from landfill gas sites, so there's huge demand for these products in the developing world.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our investment case was based on growth and significant operational improvement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And key to delivering this was the introduction of Peter, again from 3i's Business Leaders Network to lead a program of significant cultural change, alongside a number of 3i active partnership initiatives to improve MWM's strategic position and operational effectiveness.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Performance of the business has dramatically improved, and its market position is being strengthened.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this made it a really attractive acquisition target.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And last month, we announced that Caterpillar had agreed to purchase MWM for EUR 580 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now this sale which is subject to various regulatory approvals will deliver 2.",1781
18511,"2010m11","2x money multiple and proceeds of EUR 224 million to 3i Group, as well as on an IRR of 25% for 3i and the investors in our Eurofund V.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In addition to making high-quality investments such as Trescal and MWM and doing everything we can to help these businesses grow their earnings and improve their strategic positioning, we've also been investing in 3i itself.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our Infrastructure business is a great example of this.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But another strategic investment is our Debt Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This started in 2005 with a small in-house team.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The team provides banking expertise to our deal teams and to our portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In addition, it invests in high-quality debt instruments in non-3i investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This team's been a major source of strength to 3i throughout the credit crisis and has added considerable value to our investment teams and our portfolio of companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Given this positive experience, we saw a real strategic opportunity to expand our debt investment and management activities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The acquisition of MIM or was therefore an actual step.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MIM manages GBP 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7 billion of assets in eight funds of corporate, senior and subordinated debt.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The rationale for the deal was straightforward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MIM builds on the 3i's existing debt management capabilities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MIM also brings an experienced team of 28 people to 3i, including Jeremy.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Jeremy will join our leadership team and head up the Debt Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This move creates a platform to manage multiple funds and provides the potential to diversify into other debt products, as well as the capacity to grow using 3i's balance sheet.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Strategically, the Debt Management business is important because like infrastructure, it provides the opportunity for a good source of low volatility returns with a significant yield component.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This next slide shows you the shape of the business once the MIM acquisition is complete, which we expect to be at the end of January 2011.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our Private Equity business is clearly the largest, with assets under management of GBP 7.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In September, we announced the decision to combine our Buyout and Growth Capital businesses to form a single Private Equity business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The rationale for this change was to ensure that we had the right model for a changing market and is based on ensuring we continue to develop our business model to maintain a sustainable competitive advantage.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our Buyout and Growth Capital businesses have the same mid-market focus, targeting companies with an enterprise value in the range of EUR 100 million to EUR 1 billion.",1781
18511,"2010m11","They have the same investment and management processes, and our teams adopt the same approach to achieving influence through being active members of the portfolio company boards.",1781
18511,"2010m11","They share the same active partnership approach to driving value, both use the group's network and next sector expertise and both draw on our Business Leaders Network members.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now another important driver of this decision was our view on what the next generation of private equity funds might look like.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our view was that an evil vision towards more regionally-based funds and most LPs are more focused on making geographic allocations than the distinction between majority and minority private equity investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've also been preparing for the next generation of leadership in our investment business, and I'll say more on that in a minute.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This change has been welcomed by professional advisors, management teams, our Business Leaders Network and our own people.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The feedback that we've had is it will make 3i easier to understand and easier to deal with.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this is critical in a highly competitive market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've been actively communicating with our LP investors in both our buyout and growth funds.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we are, of course, committed to managing these funds on the same basis through to the end of their investing periods.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now following these changes, we're in a six-month consultation period with our Eurofund Advisory Board.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Those discussions are constructive and include the possibility of potentially extending the fund for one year beyond November 2011.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Notwithstanding the six-month consultation period, we expect matters to be resolved by the end of the calendar year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So the bottom line is the fund continues as normal.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've also recently promoted three people to the leadership team, Alan Giddins and Cressida Hogg, you already heard from.",1781
18511,"2010m11","has been a senior partner in the Buyout business and will take over leadership of the buyout fund and the geographical responsibility for Northern Europe.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Alan Giddins, who is also a senior partner in Buyouts and has also that our business services sector across the whole company, will have responsibility for the U.",1781
18511,"2010m11","and all our sector activities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We now have three stroke platforms for growth, which can leverage our resources and expertise.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The growth of our Debt Management and Infrastructure businesses brings similar benefits to 3i, not least in lowering potential volatility through generating increased revenue profits.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I want to give you a brief update on six of our largest investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There are some really common themes as to how they have generated growth and value in the recession.",1781
18511,"2010m11","These are international development, improve strategy and positioning, operational effectiveness and also following a buy and build strategy.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There more details of these and other companies in your packs and on the IR website.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But let me to do so these companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","ACR is a pan-Asian reinsurer that we invested in, in 2006.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Today, it has premiums of USD $500 million and customers across 50 countries.",1781
18511,"2010m11","is a leading manufacturer of joining technology products and solutions.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It operates across 80 countries and, since we invested has opened new plants in China, Thailand, Mexico, Russia and Serbia.",1781
18511,"2010m11","EBITDA has tripled during our investment period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Foster & Partners is one of the world's most innovative architectural practices and since our investment has continued to expand internationally and has now deliver projects and 50 countries.",1781
18511,"2010m11","EBITDA has grown 68% since our investment in 2007.",1781
18511,"2010m11","is a leading funeral service provider in Spain and Portugal.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Through acquisitions, growth and operational improvement, EBITDA is up 21% from the time of our investment in 2008.",1781
18511,"2010m11","may be well known to you through its brand.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this business has grown internationally from virtually nothing when we invested to 55% of sales today.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And the last of these six companies is, the global market leader in outsourced clinical trial.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've supported what was already an outstanding company to grow further in Asia and Europe.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But let me return to the common themes.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In five out of these six, we supported their international development.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In all of them, our sector knowledge and ability to identify great people from our Business Leaders Network has either help the company directly or given 3i particular insight into the opportunities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In all of them, our active partnership initiative is generating operational improvements, improving their strategic positions and building robust growth through acquisitions that are enhancing returns.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Together, these companies have a combined value of GBP 724 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And more and more of our portfolio companies we're making these initiatives deliver value for us.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Today, we focus on the first two elements of our strategy, investing and growing 3i.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In order to achieve these, it's absolutely critical that we do all that we can to ensure that 3i's reputation not only remains good, but that we build on it.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our success internationally owes much to the strength of our brand.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As you heard from Cressida, 3i's brand has been central to developing a strong position in the infrastructure market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i's repetition as a responsible investor is a core part of our brand and will be placing an increased emphasis on corporate responsibility, not just to the group level but also in all our portfolio companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","At our results presentation in May, I mentioned the One 3i approached that we've been driving the business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The point of this was to increase our effectiveness, especially in terms of how we source opportunities, how we convert these opportunities into investments and then how we create value once invested.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This underpins all the other elements of our strategy.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And of course, the real test of whether this strategy delivers value will be our long-term financial performance and reputation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So let me turn to the outlook and our priorities for the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Predicting the macroeconomic outlook remains a challenge.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The important thing is that 3i is in a strong position to take advantage of either a sustained improvement or given our financial strength, to deal with further turbulence.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The outlook for our Private Equity business is improving.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Pricing will remain full.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I think that this will continue for another 12 to 18 months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But despite this, we can find good investments, as we've demonstrated with Trescal and Vedici.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As Cressida said, conditions in the infrastructure market in Europe and in India look favorable.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And as demonstrated by the two investments we've announced in the last week.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The outlook for the Debt Management business is also positive, with the opportunity to grow assets under management through new funds and further acquisitions.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The combination of the MIM team's track record and capabilities and 3i's brand and financial strength position us well to take advantage of these opportunities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So overall, the outlook for 3i is good, and we've therefore taken the opportunity to increase our dividend by 20%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In the short term, our priorities are to continue to deliver good financial performance, to integrate MIM, and to increase momentum in our investment activity.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So in conclusion, our key themes for today are: we've increased the momentum throughout the business; our portfolio has also delivered a good performance; we've made good progress in terms of strategic development; and we now have three strong platforms for growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I also said at the beginning, we've moved from planning and organizing growth to delivering growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Julia, Cressida and I would now be happy to take any questions that you've got.",1781
18511,"2010m11","[Operator Instructions] Just with the OpEx point.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Actually, some of our costs activity-related.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So as activity levels are building up in terms of investment and improvement, then I'm expecting to see some cost coming through that.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Effectively, what I'm saying to do is just don't double the number for the first half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There'll be a small increase on the first half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But overall, we're on a continuing downward trajectory.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In terms of the health of the portfolio, I mean, the general trend actually is positive.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We're seeing month by month continued overall trend.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The provisions numbers are slightly skewed because you get an individual company that has got specific issues relating to that company that will go through the provision that will make a difference of that figure.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So you can't necessarily draw conclusions across the portfolio from those individual numbers.",1781
18511,"2010m11","One company in the growth portfolio that was a sizable chunk of that provision number, actually, could come back very strongly, so we could end up March actually in effect reversing out some of that provision.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But we have a set policy that the company is performing a particularly way, we will make a provision.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But the key message is the underlying health of the portfolio is continuing to show steady improvement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Bruce Hamilton, Morgan Stanley.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I mean, obviously, the earnings growth was a very good number in the period of up 8%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I guess the didn't move.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Given that, to achieve sort of 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","8% sort of return to shareholders, which more of 5% if I x out the FX monies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","On the plate, it doesn't look that impressive.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I guess looking forward, realizations will improve, but should we also the the earnings growth will moderate.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I mean, what would you expect as a more quite normal level of earnings growth? Or is sort of 15% per year something you think is achievable? I think we're learning to live with an environment where everything a financial company does is immediately reported in the press.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So you have a pretty good view on the pipeline of potential realizations coming forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","What I can say is when we look at the assets that have been talked about, a number of our big industrial companies, particularly I think Continental Europe, we expect to achieve extremely attractive prices for these assets because they are really high quality businesses.",1781
18511,"2010m11","One of the businesses that's being talked about that I referred to, , is just a sensational business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","That has a potential to be a very, very strong IPO candidate,  not just a potential trade sale.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It's a very attractive business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And the reason it's attractive is because it's got great exposure to developing markets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","One of the things that we'd be pushing across all of our industrial portfolio is where they haven't already got strong market access in India, China or South America, really helping them to move that forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And that's what make these assets very attractive.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I mean, one of the things themes that we've been focused on is how do we access that developing market growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I think there are two ways to do that.",1781
18511,"2010m11","One is to invest directly in Asian companies, which clearly we're doing as in GBK.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But the other is to make sure our great European businesses are also accessing that growth, and therefore we can benefit in that one as well.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everybody.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me start my financial update by taking you through the highlights of the six months to September.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Investment at GBP 327 million was still at a relatively modest level, although significantly up from last year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our portfolio has performed well, with an improvement in earnings evaluation purposes of 8% in the six months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is a key driver of the 8.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7% gross portfolio return in the six months, despite lower multiples used to value the portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The benefits of the tough decisions we've taken in our own business is reflected in our operating costs, which have continued to fall.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our total return on opening shareholders funds at 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","8% was an encouraging result.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And consequently, the board has approved an interim dividend of 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","2p per share, as we've taken the opportunity to reset our dividend at a higher lever.",1781
18511,"2010m11","NAV per share grew by 9p in the period to 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Importantly, as Michael said, this is a 15% increase on a year ago.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we have finished the period with liquidity of more than GBP 2 billion and net debt of only GBP 352 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me give you some more detail on the investment of GBP 327 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We have invested GBP 58 million in two new businesses: , which is a European calibration service provider; and Vedici, the fifth-largest acute healthcare company in France.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In this very competitive market, both experience and will provide opportunities to buy and build.",1781
18511,"2010m11","More than a third investment was made expanding the investment in our existing portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We continue to provide acquisition funding as we see our portfolio companies able to transactions which are not subject to the same high prices we see elsewhere.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we've also taken the opportunity in two cases to buy senior debt and pick at discounted value is.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Realizations of GBP 293 million were achieved as an 11% uplift over opening book value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The most significant individual transaction was the sale of its global Commodity Testing and Inspection division.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As a result, we received proceeds of GBP 121 million and retained a top 30 investment, which is valued at GBP 42 million, which is now called ESG and is focused on environmental and food testing.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Despite the prevalence of secondary transactions in the market, almost all of our realizations with the non-financial buyers.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Looking on at the breakdown of our total return.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Gross portfolio return is the return we generate directly from our portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The GBP 307 million represents an 8.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7% return on opening portfolio value for the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It is driven by period performance in the portfolio, giving unrealized profits of GBP 196 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","All our core business lines generated an 8% return in the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We then get to net portfolio return reflecting the income across associated with Asset Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","For GBP 206 million represent the gross portfolio return diluted by carry payable and operating expenses and enhanced by carry receivable and fund fee income.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Finally, total return takes account of the effects of our balance sheet structure.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So the GBP 117 million of return is achieved after deducting of cost of finance as well as a net exchange loss of GBP 29 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So turning then to the valuation of our portfolio and its effect on our returns in the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","You will see from this slide that most of the return in this period comes from the highest-quality factors, uplifts to sale and portfolio earnings growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This builds on the momentum in the second half of last year and represents a very different picture from that of 12 months ago.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The uplift on assets which are in the process of being sold was GBP 66 million in the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It includes the sale to Caterpillar of MWM, what is a German-headquartered global business supplying alternative engines.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This transaction is expected is complete by the end of the year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So this slide gives you some more detail on the earnings and multiple movements that we've used in our valuations exercise.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I've said before, the most striking aspect is the improvement in the quality of value growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Looking at the first line in the table, earnings used for the valuations grew by 8% in the first half, accounting for GBP 273 million of growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This followed the 5% increase in the second half of last year and compared to the 13% decrease in the comparative period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This growth reflects the tough actions that our portfolio companies have been taking in the face of the considerable economic uncertainty that Michael has talked about in his statement this morning.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Markets were volatile in the six months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And overall, the market month pulls in the sectors and geographies in which we are invested fell during the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Consequently, the multiples we used in the valuations declined by 5%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This compares to a 10% increase in the second half of last year and a 21% increase in the comparative period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As usual, we've provided you with further analysis regarding our valuations in the appendices to your presentation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Before talking about the balance sheet, let me make a few comments on other components of total return.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Fund fee income generated is marginally up on the same period last year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is principally due to capital funded the end of March.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I mentioned earlier, we have taken tough actions ourselves to improve cost efficiency.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Operating costs were down to GBP 89 million for the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I do expect us to be marginally higher in the second half although the year-on-year trajectory remains down.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The GBP 29 million exchange loss was incurred in the first six months due to the strengthening of sterling.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The earning hedging in operation in the six-month period was affected by our core currency borrowings.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As we've noted in our statement this morning, the board has recently decided to extend the hedging policy to include the use of derivatives.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is a limited extension and will not exceed 30% of the corresponding portfolio value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Implementation will be phased throughout the second half of this year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Turning then to the balance sheet.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've continued to adopt a conservative approach to our balance sheet management.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We set ourselves a limit on net debt of GBP 1 billion.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We have also objective of reducing our gross debt and managing maturities so that over time, maturities in any one year will be no more than the GBP 300 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Consistent with our strategy, gross debt has been reduced by GBP 354 million through a series of actions, significantly, the repayments of GBP 195 million of the convertible bond and GBP 89 million of commercial paper.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we've continued the this activity until September.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There was an increase in net debt in as a result of net cash outflow in the period due to operating activity.",1781
18511,"2010m11","However, the net debt GBP 352 million is comfortable within our GBP 1 million limit.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And the group's liquidity position remains very strong at GBP 2.",1781
18511,"2010m11","1 billion, meaning, we are well positioned for investment.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So in summary and to complete my review of the financial performance, we have seen good portfolio performance, driven by earnings improvements.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We have a continued focus on conservative balance sheet management, and we remain well positioned to manage against continuing uncertainty in the market and take advantage of investment opportunities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I'm now going to hand over to Cressida who's going to update you on our Infrastructure business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Charles, one of the things that we've always seen in this business going through economic cycles is that the demand for growth capital picks up as you start to come out of a downturn.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So through the bottom of the market you don't actually see a lot of demand, and then you see that demand pick up.",1781
18511,"2010m11","What's being unusual this time is as we've started to see economic recovery, there's been a real reticence among businesses to actually invest, whether it's in a fixed plant and equipment, going out and buying new businesses.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now it's hard to say whether that trend is going to continue.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But it certainly surprised us that we haven't seen a stronger growth capital pickup, given where we are in the economic cycle.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And it maybe that the way that the banks have behaved has resulted in people being extremely nervous about entering into any new commitments going forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There is certainly an element of that.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But I would have to say, I just think that this position, this growth in demand growth capital has simply been deferred.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And certainly, if we look at the work in progress that we're seeing and we're tracking this on a daily basis, we are seeing the early stage work in progress around growth capital is starting to pick up.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But I think it's too early to say whether that is an evidence of a trend.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But I think it's being deferred in the cycle and certainly happening later than we saw in previous cycles.",1781
18511,"2010m11","First, just following on the provisions and impairment side, am I right in the detail of the text you do highlighted help deterioration on the growth side of the portfolio, the percentage being done versus September versus March.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I wonder what's going on there.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And secondly, you mentioned about expectation of H2 OpEx being higher than H1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Could you give a bit color what's H1 or what's expected H2, given the H1 is strongly below the run rate, shall we say, of last year -- Securities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I've got a couple of questions.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Firstly, provisions and impairments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","These have increased again.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I think over the last two halves, they were actually positive, if I remember correctly.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Can you just give us a bit more color on that? How many assets are involved? And then the other question was on cash.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I mean, there are quite a number of sales that have been announced over the last few months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","If you project the cash that you're expecting to come in, how much is actually due to come in and be completed then leave net debt? Charles.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Neiman Securities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Michael, I understand what you're saying about pricing.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But even allowing for that, the level of investment growth in capital seems particularly low over the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Were there any reasons for that? And how do you see that going forward? Well, if there aren't, as Patrick said, we wanted to conclude by 10:02.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And amazingly, we've done exactly that.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So thank you all very much for coming.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Julia, Cressida and I and Patrick are available all day for any other questions that you've got.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we look forward to seeing you over the next six months in our various one-on-one meetings.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So thank you, all, for coming.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Is there anything else due to come through in the next few weeks? That's the most significant transaction coming through.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thank you, Julia, and good morning.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i has grown and established a profitable Infrastructure business from small beginnings.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We started investing in infrastructure-type assets through our private equity business that set up Infrastructure as a separate business line in 2005, as the market increasingly began to view infrastructure as a distinct asset class in its own right.",1781

18511,"2010m11","Julia has just taken you through three return model, and this slide shows how the total return to infrastructure is generated.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i does not invest in infrastructure assets directly, but through 3i Infrastructure and through the India Fund.",1781
18511,"2010m11","These to contribute to do great portfolio returns in the same way as any other asset through the realized and unrealized value movements and through dividends and capital returns.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i also generates advisory and performance fees from 3i infrastructure and management fees and carry from the India Fund.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This income is partly offset by the carry payables of the investment team and by the cost of running the business line, which consist mostly of staff costs.",1781

18511,"2010m11","The company has strong infrastructure characteristics and fits in 3i Infrastructure's investment mandate as a mature cash-generative asset with stable contracted revenues for the following reasons.",1781
18511,"2010m11","First, the market fundamentals are strong because the fleet is fully utilized following a decade of passenger growth, and the government is unlikely to procure many new trains in the near term due to budgetary constraints.",1781

18511,"2010m11","So one of the factors that you have in this period is the consequence of us refinancing in affect the convertible bond ahead of time.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So you remember we took advantage of the small of opportunity in March to raise the GBP 350 million fixed rate bond that we have.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So you've got the interest cost of that coming, overlapping with the convertible bond in the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It's a consequence of actually our conservative balance sheet management.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The important thing is by next year, that overlap will have faded out.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And then I don't really want to go to the joys of IS39 accounting.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But one of the consequences of that in trying to manage the overlap I've talked about, we've been buying back our convertible bond in the market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The convertible bond has an amortization charge that comes through the total return statement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The consequence of buying it back early means that we've accelerated some of that amortization into the first half, so there's GBP 8 million of accelerated amortization sitting in those notes numbers.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The way I'm looking at is really looking through to next year, when all of these factors should have washed out, when we'll have a fixed interest cost of about GBP 50 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And that will be about half of our interest costs going forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And just going back on the cash, if we take into account transactions such as MWM, how much cash is still to come through on deals haven't completed yet? Thanks, Patrick.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Half Yearly Results Presentation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is our agenda for today.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I'm going to give a short introduction, and then Julia will present a financial review of the first half year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Cressida Hogg, who's our managing partner of the Infrastructure business, will then give you an overview of this important part of 3i's investment activity.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And finally, I'll review our strategic progress and cover the outlook and priorities for the next six months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I said in the statement this morning, we've increased momentum throughout the business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our portfolio has delivered a good performance, achieving a gross portfolio return of 8.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7% for the six months until the 30th of September.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Total return was lower at 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","8%, although NAV growth over the last 12 months is over 15%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've made good progress in terms of strategic development, and we now have three strong platforms for growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In my last few presentations to you, I've talked about planning and organizing for growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've now moved into the delivery phase.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I'll give you more detail on this later.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But before that, Julia will review our financial performance.",1781
18511,"2010m11","If I talk about the first half in particular, one of the things I talked about is the conservative balance sheet management and trying to extend our maturities and manage those maturities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So one of the factors that you have in this period is the consequence of us refinancing in effect the convertible bond ahead of time.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So you remember we took advantage of the small window of opportunity in March to raise the GBP 350 million fixed rate bond that we have.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So you've got the interest cost of that coming in overlapping with the convertible bond in the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It's a consequence of actually our conservative balance sheet management.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The important thing is by next year, that overlap will have phased out.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And then I don't really want to go to the joys of IS39 accounting.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But one of the consequences of that in trying to manage the overlap I've talked about, we've been buying back our convertible bond in the market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The convertible bond has an amortization charge that comes through the total return statement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The consequence of buying it back early means that we've accelerated some of that amortization into the first half, so there's GBP 8 million of accelerated amortization sitting in those numbers.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The way I'm looking at is really looking through to next year, when all of these factors should have washed out, when we'll have a fixed interest cost of about GBP 50 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And that will be about half of our interest costs going forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And just going back on the cash, if we take into account transactions such as MWM, how much cash is still to come through on deals that haven't completed yet? [indiscernible] Firstly, provisions and impairments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","These have increased again.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I think over the last two halves, they were actually positive, if I remember correctly.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Can you just give us a bit more color on that? How many assets are involved? And then the other question was on cash.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I mean, there are quite a number of sales that you've announced over the last few months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","If you project the cash that you're expecting to come in, how much is actually due to come in and be completed? Where will that then leave net debt? I think we're learning to live with an environment where everything a financial company does is immediately reported in the press.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So you have a pretty good view on the pipeline of potential realizations that are coming forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","What I can say is when we look at the assets that have been talked about, a number of our big industrial companies, particularly in Continental Europe, we expect to achieve extremely attractive prices for these assets because they are really high quality businesses.",1781
18511,"2010m11","One of the businesses that's being talked about that I referred to, NORMA, is just a sensational business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","That has a potential to be a very, very strong IPO candidate, not just a potential trade sale.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It's a very attractive business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And the reason it's attractive is because it's got great exposure to developing markets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","One of the things that we'd be pushing across all of our industrial portfolio is where they haven't already got strong market access in India, China or South America, really helping them to move that forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And that's what makes these assets very attractive.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I mean, one of the themes that we've been focused on is how do we access that developing market growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I think there are two ways to do that.",1781
18511,"2010m11","One is to invest directly in Asian companies, which clearly we're doing as in GBK, but the other is to make sure our great European businesses are also accessing that growth, and therefore we can benefit in that one as well.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Michael, you were talking about pricing remaining full.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Can you talk about the prospects for upselling some assets into that strength in the second half? I mean, obviously, there have been a few press stories about one or two of your assets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","That's the most significant transaction coming through.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In terms of the health of the portfolio, I mean, the general trend actually is positive.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We're seeing month by month continued overall trends.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The provisions numbers are slightly skewed because you get an individual company that has got specific issues relating to that company that will go through the provision that will make a difference to that figure.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So you can't necessarily draw conclusions across the portfolio from those individual numbers.",1781
18511,"2010m11","One company in the growth portfolio that was a sizable chunk of that provision number, actually, could come back very strongly, so we could end up at the 31st of March actually in effect reversing out some of that provision.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But we have a set policy that the company is performing in a particular way, we will make a provision.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But the key message is the underlying health of the portfolio is continuing to show steady improvement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So if I take your question on provisions and impairments, first, I mean, clearly, you're right.",1781
18511,"2010m11","If you compare the numbers to last year, then it doesn't look like a particularly good shift.",1781
18511,"2010m11","What it would say is clearly last year had almost the benefit of the previous year where we've had some very, very significant provisions and impairment.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So I'd say last year was unusually low.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this year, the provision level is 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","1% of opening portfolio value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","That's an unusual sort of amount.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In terms of the underlying movement sort of in there, it's a small number of assets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There's no particular themes that I can draw out for you that's spread across the business lines, that's spread across sectors and spread across geographies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The specific factors to particular investments and don't actually indicate any underlying trend for the overall portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And then in terms of cash for the period, I mean, clearly there are, as Michael has said, there was a number of transactions that are being well trailed in the market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Without trying to give you a specific number where we expect cash to be because we would like actually to be investing in the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So it's realistic to assume that there will be some significant realizations coming through.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But in terms of where net debt's going to be, I would hope that we would actually be putting in some decent amount of investment in the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Some of that will come down to timing.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Where we're talking about smaller numbers of large transactions, we can get quite different numbers coming over the year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So I would hope that we would have investment, but clearly this number of realizations going through.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everybody.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me start my financial update by taking you through the highlights of the six months to September.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Investment at GBP 327 million was still at a relatively modest level, although it was significantly up from last year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our portfolio has performed well, with an improvement in earnings evaluation purposes of 8% in the six months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is the key driver of the 8.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7% gross portfolio return in the six months, despite lower multiples used to value the portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The benefits of the tough decisions we've taken in our own business is reflected in our operating costs, which have continued to fall.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our total return on opening shareholders funds at 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","8% was an encouraging result.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And consequently, the board has been approved an interim dividend of 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","2p per share, as we've taken the opportunity to reset our dividend at a higher lever.",1781
18511,"2010m11","NAV per share grew by 9p in the period to GBP 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Importantly, as Michael said, this is a 15% increase on a year ago.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we have finished the period with liquidity of more than GBP 2 billion and net debt of only GBP 352 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me give you some more detail on the investment of GBP 327 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We have invested GBP 58 million in two new businesses: Trescal, which is a European calibration service provider; and Vedici, the fifth-largest acute healthcare company in France.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In this very competitive market, both experience and will provide opportunities to buy and build.",1781
18511,"2010m11","More than the third in investment was made expanding the investment in our existing portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We continue to provide acquisition funding as we see our portfolio companies able to do transactions which are not subject to the same high prices we see elsewhere.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we've also taken the opportunity in two cases to buy senior debt and pick at discounted values.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Realizations of GBP 293 million were achieved as an 11% uplift over opening book value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The most significant individual transaction was the sale by Inspectorate of its global Commodity Testing and Inspection division.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As a result, we received proceeds of GBP 121 million and retained a top 30 investment, which is valued at GBP 42 million, which is now called ESG and is focused on environmental and food testing.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Despite the prevalence of secondary transactions in the market, almost all of our realizations with the non-financial buyers.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Looking then at the breakdown of our total return.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Gross portfolio return is the return we generate directly from our portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The GBP 307 million represents an 8.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7% return on opening portfolio value for the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It is driven by period performance in the portfolio, giving rise to unrealized profits of GBP 196 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","All our core business lines generated an 8% return in the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We then get to net portfolio return by reflecting the income and costs associated with the Asset Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So the GBP 236 million represents the gross portfolio return diluted by carry payable and operating expenses and enhanced by carry receivable and fund fee income.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Finally, total return takes account of the effects of our balance sheet structure.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So the GBP 117 million of return is achieved after deducting our cost of finance as well as a net exchange loss of GBP 29 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So turning then to the valuation of our portfolio and its effect on our returns in the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","You will see from this slide that most of the return in this period comes from the highest-quality factors, uplifts to sale and portfolio earnings growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This builds on the momentum in the second half of last year and represents a very different picture from that of 12 months ago.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The uplift on assets, which are in the process of being sold, was GBP 66 million in the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It includes the sale to Caterpillar of MWM, which is a German-headquartered global business supplying alternative engines.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This transaction is expected is complete by the end of the year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So this slide gives you some more detail on the earnings and multiple movements that we've used in our valuations exercise.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I've said before, the most striking aspect is the improvement in the quality of value growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Looking at the first line in the table, earnings used for the valuations grew by 8% in the first half, accounting for GBP 273 million of growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This followed a 5% increase in the second half of last year and compared to a 13% decline in the comparative period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This growth reflects the tough actions that our portfolio companies have been taking in the face of the considerable economic uncertainty that Michael has talked about in his statement this morning.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Markets were volatile in the six months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And overall, the market month pulls in the sectors and geographies in which we are invested fell during the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Consequently, the multiples we used in the valuations declined by 5%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This compares to a 10% increase in the second half of last year and a 21% increase in the comparative period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As usual, we've provided you with further analysis regarding our valuations in the appendices to your presentation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Before talking about the balance sheet, let me make a few comments on other components of total return.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Fund fee income generated is marginally up on the same period last year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is principally due to the launch of the growth capital fund at the end of March.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I mentioned earlier, we have taken tough actions ourselves to improve cost efficiency.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Operating costs were down to GBP 89 million for the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I do expect cost to be marginally higher in the second half, although the year-on-year trajectory remains down.",1781
18511,"2010m11","A GBP 29 million exchange loss was incurred in the first six months due to the strengthening of sterling.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The earning hedging in operation in the six-month period was that affected by our core currency borrowings.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As we've noted in our statement this morning, the board has recently decided to extend the hedging policy to include the use of derivatives.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is a limited extension and will not exceed 30% of the corresponding portfolio value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Implementation will be phased throughout the second half of this year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Turning then to the balance sheet.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've continued to adopt a conservative approach to our balance sheet management.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We set ourselves a limit on net debt of GBP 1 billion.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We have also set an objective of reducing our gross debt and managing maturities so that over time, maturities in any one year will be no more than GBP 300 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Consistent with that strategy, gross debt has been reduced by GBP 354 million through a series of actions, significantly, the repayments of GBP 195 million of the convertible bond and GBP 89 million of commercial paper.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we've continued with this activity since September.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There was an increase in net debt as a result of net cash outflow in the period due to operating activity.",1781
18511,"2010m11","However, the net debt of GBP 352 million is comfortably within our GBP 1 billion limit.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And the group's liquidity position remains very strong at GBP 2.",1781
18511,"2010m11","1 billion, meaning, we are well positioned for investment.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So in summary and to complete my review of the financial performance, we have seen good portfolio performance, driven by earnings improvements.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We have a continued focus on conservative balance sheet management, and we remain well positioned to manage against continuing uncertainty in the market and take advantage of investment opportunities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I'm now going to hand over to Cressida, who's going to update you on our Infrastructure business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Well, I think what we're looking to do overall is deliver 15% returns to shareholders.",1781
18511,"2010m11","That will come in a combination of forms, will come from the earnings growth on the portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We typically do see a step-up when we sell assets open above the carrying value, so that gives an additional boost to return; and of course, from the income streams from managing third-party assets, which clearly will start to rise as we incorporate the Debt Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I think if you look at this half year's performance, I mean, the way I try and look at this is to sort of x out multiple movement, both up and down, whether year and a half, half-year period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And so I think what they're all about in terms of the overall consistency with that delivery of that trend.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thank you, Julia, and good morning.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i has grown and established a profitable Infrastructure business from small beginnings.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We started investing in infrastructure-type assets through our private equity business that set up Infrastructure as a separate business line in 2005, as the market increasingly began to view infrastructure as a distinct asset class in its own right.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Since then, we've used 3i's investment expertise and capital to make infrastructure investments and to see two external funds, which now have combined assets under management of approximately GBP 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This slide gives more detail on our two infrastructure investment vehicles.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i Infrastructure PLC, in which we have a 33% holding, is a listed investment company, with a market cap and net assets of just under GBP 1 billion.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Its overall objective is to provide shareholders with a total return, net of costs, of 12% per annum when fully invested, with 5% distributors of yield.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The company's focus is on core infrastructure, which we define as assets with stable contracted revenues or some sort of regulatory protection, principally in the transportation and utility space.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It also has exposure to social infrastructure assets and to the Indian infrastructure market, through a commitment of 3i India Infrastructure Fund.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i Infrastructure's portfolio provides a high degree of inflation linkage, strong income generation, and opportunities for capital growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The company last week announced a new investment in Eversholt Rail Group and now has an investment portfolio of 15 assets worth around GBP 800 million and remaining cash balances of GBP 138 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The 3i India Infrastructure Funds, in which both 3i Group and 3i Infrastructure have a GBP 250 million commitment, is a GBP 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","2 billion LP fund established to access the growing infrastructure market in India.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It focuses on the port, airport, road and power sectors.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And its objective is to deliver an 18% net returns to its investors.",1781

18511,"2010m11","Our two external funds have now established a very strong track record and a good reputation in the market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","With its focus on mature infrastructure assets in developed economies, 3i Infrastructure has built a robust cash-generated portfolio, which has delivered a 9.",1781
18511,"2010m11","5% annualized growth in returns since inception during a period of great market volatility.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Importantly, it has also delivered its 5% yield objective in every year since inception.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And our India funds, with its focus on early-stage infrastructure assets in one fastest-growing economies in the world, is now valued at 56% above cost and has delivered a gross ROI since inception of nearly 20% so far, in line with its long-term return objectives.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Many of our LPs have singled this fund out as one of their best performing investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Julia has just taken you through 3i's return model, and this slide shows how the total return to infrastructure is generated.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i does not invest in infrastructure assets directly, but through 3i Infrastructure and through the India Fund.",1781
18511,"2010m11","These two contribute to do gross portfolio return in the same way as any other asset, through the realized and unrealized value movements and through dividends and capital returns.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i also generates advisory and performance fees from 3i infrastructure and management fees and carry from the India Fund.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This income is partly offset by the carry payables of the investment team and by the cost of running the business line, which consist mostly of staff costs.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Being part of 3i has been key to the success of the Infrastructure business line.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i's brand and investment track record are recognized beyond private equity, and its people and network provide unparalleled access to opportunities, as well as to investments in portfolio management expertise.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is a strong platform from which to expand our business going forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I now wanted to give you a little more detail on 3i Infrastructure's new investment in Eversholt Rail Group, as it provides a flavor of the type of asset that we invest in.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Eversholt is one of the three leading rail rolling stock companies or ROSCOs in the U.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i infrastructure, in a consortium with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and Star Capital Partners, is acquiring 100% of the equity.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i infrastructure will be contributing up to GBP 176 million in equity instruments to finance the purchase, which in total values Eversholt's assets at around GBP 2.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Eversholt currently owns 29% of the British Royal Fleet.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Its 19 fleets at least to seven train operating companies or TOCs.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And its primary revenue stream consists of lease payments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The company has strong infrastructure characteristics and fits in 3i Infrastructure's investment mandate as a mature cash-generative assets with stable contracted revenues for the following reasons.",1781
18511,"2010m11","First, the market fundamentals are strong because the fleet is fully utilized following a decade of passenger growth, and the government is unlikely to procure many new trains in the near term due to budgetary constraints.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Second, Eversholt itself has strong fundamentals, with high-quality cash flows that are contracted for the medium-term.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Third, Eversholt has high margins with a low cost base.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And finally, Eversholt has a defensive diversified fleet portfolio with an impressive operational history.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In summary, Eversholt offers an exposure to a profitable transport asset with stable contracted revenues, a strong market position, and defensive characteristics.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now I'd like to look forward to the market opportunity in our key geographical regions: Europe, North America and India.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The market opportunity in Europe and North America is driven by similar factors.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The focus on deficit reduction will drive an increased flow of government disposals and potentially PFI opportunities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The recent government auction of HS1 in the U.",1781
18511,"2010m11","is a case in point.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The flow of non-core disposals by corporate and financial institutions is continuing and our recent investment in Eversholt, which we purchased from HSBC is an example of this.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The cyclical recovery has de-risked some assets with a higher GDP correlation, making them more attractive to infrastructure investors like ourselves.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And finally, there are policy drivers that may result in new opportunities, such as the use of infrastructure spending for economic stimulus and the incentivization of the green economy.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our current pipeline includes opportunities in all these categories.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The opportunity in India will continue to be driven by the growing infrastructure deficit.",1781
18511,"2010m11","A combination of GDP growth and expanding population and increasing organization, means that the Indian government is struggling to keep up with the demand for new build infrastructure.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There is significant political momentum to tackle this however.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The Indian government is putting a strong emphasis on private sector participation and partnership in building out infrastructure assets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Through the India Fund, we are progressing a very attractive pipeline of opportunities, and some of these have reached the advanced stage.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thanks, Cressida.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I'd now like to update you on our strategic progress and then talk about the outlook and our priorities for the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The four key elements of our strategy, as set out on this slide, are also described in detail on our IR website as well as in our annual report.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And today, I want to mainly focus on two aspects of this strategy, investing and growing the business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me start with investment.",1781
18511,"2010m11","High-quality new investment is important to future value growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But the environment for making good investments has been challenging.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me explain what I mean by challenging.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Volume of private equity activity across Europe has been very low.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The number of transactions for both growth and buyouts is a third the level than it was in 2007.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But the funds available for investment continue to be very high, with the consequence that most transactions in Europe have been very high prices so we have an overhang of capital in our industry.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now in this environment, we've taken a measured and highly selective approach to the market and focused only on making investments where we feel we can make a significant impact on the performance of a particular company.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Trescal is a very good example of such a situation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It's a classic mid-market buyout in terms of size and profile.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Trescal is a French-based International business, providing calibration services for a wide range of industrial companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It has revenue of EUR 110 million and operates 60 laboratories in 11 countries.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We were able to invest through our strong relationship with the management, our experience having made several successful investments in the sector and the involvement of [indiscernible] from our business leaders network.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The investment case is based on four components.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Firstly, Trescal is in a growing sector, as many of its customers are looking to outsource testing and measurement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Secondly, because capital investment is required in building a company like Trescal, there are significant barriers to entry.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thirdly, through our active partnership analysis, we and management believe there's considerable opportunity for operational improvement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And finally, given its market position and a highly fragmented sector, there's a real opportunity for buy and build.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now increasing the level of investment is only one way to grow 3i's value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In addition, we must also continue to take every opportunity to grow the value of our existing portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Earnings growth in our portfolio is being good.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And one of the ways that our portfolio companies have been delivering this is to find opportunities in developing markets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MWM is a very good example of this.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MWM is a GBP 360 million euro buyout from Deutsche AG in 2007.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And it's a leading manufacturer of engines that are used to produce power.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now a typical use for an MWM engine is generating power from landfill gas sites, so there's huge demand for these products in the developing world.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our investment case was based on growth and significant operational improvement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And key to delivering this was the introduction of Peter Grosch, again from 3i's Business Leaders Network to lead a program of significant cultural change, alongside a number of 3i active partnership initiatives to improve MWM's strategic position and operational effectiveness.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Performance of the business has dramatically improved, and its market position has been strengthened.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this made it a really attractive acquisition target.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And last month, we announced that Caterpillar had agreed to purchase MWM for EUR 580 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now this sale which is subject to various regulatory approvals will deliver 2.",1781
18511,"2010m11","2x money multiple and proceeds of EUR 224 million to 3i Group, as well as an IRR of 25% for 3i and the investors in our Eurofund V.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In addition to making high-quality investments such as Trescal and MWM and doing everything we can to help these businesses grow their earnings and improve their strategic positioning, we've also been investing in 3i itself.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our Infrastructure business is a great example of this.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But another strategic investment is our Debt Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This started in 2005 with a small in-house team.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The team provides banking expertise to our deal teams and to our portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In addition, it invests in high-quality debt instruments in non-3i investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This team's been a major source of strength to 3i throughout the credit crisis and has added considerable value to our investment teams and our portfolio of companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Given this positive experience, we saw a real strategic opportunity to expand our debt investment and management activities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The acquisition of MIM from Mizuho was therefore a natural step.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MIM manages GBP 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7 billion of assets in eight funds of corporate, senior and subordinated debt.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The rationale to the deal was straightforward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MIM builds on 3i's existing debt management capabilities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MIM also brings an experienced team of 28 people to 3i, including Jeremy Ghose.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Jeremy will join our leadership team and head up the Debt Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This move creates a platform to manage multiple funds and provides the potential to diversify into other debt products, as well as the capacity to grow using 3i's balance sheet.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Strategically, the Debt Management business is important because like infrastructure, it provides the opportunity for a good source of low volatility returns with a significant yield component.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This next slide shows you the shape of the business once the MIM acquisition is complete, which we expect to be at the end of January 2011.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our Private Equity business is clearly the largest, with assets under management of GBP 7.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In September, we announced the decision to combine our Buyout and Growth Capital businesses to form a single Private Equity business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The rationale for this change was to ensure that we had the right model for a changing market and is based on ensuring we continue to develop our business model to maintain a sustainable competitive advantage.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our Buyout and Growth Capital businesses have the same mid-market focus, targeting companies with an enterprise value in the range of EUR 100 million to EUR 1 billion.",1781
18511,"2010m11","They have the same investment and management processes, and our teams adopt the same approach to achieving influence through being active members of the portfolio company boards.",1781
18511,"2010m11","They share the same active partnership approach to driving value, both use the group's network and sector expertise and both draw on our Business Leaders Network members.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now another important driver of this decision was our view on what the next generation of private equity funds might look like.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our view was that there's an evolution towards more regionally-based funds and that most LPs are more focused on making geographic allocations than the distinction between majority and minority private equity investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've also been preparing for the next generation of leadership in our investment business, and I'll say more on that in a minute.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This change has been welcomed by professional advisors, management teams, our Business Leaders Network and our own people.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The feedback that we've had is it will make 3i easier to understand and easier to deal with.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this is critical in a highly competitive market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've been actively communicating with our LP investors in both our buyout and growth funds.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we are, of course, committed to managing these funds on the same basis through to the end of their investing periods.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now following these changes this quarter, we're in a six-month consultation period with our Eurofund V Advisory Board.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Those discussions are constructive and include the possibility of potentially extending the fund for one year beyond November 2011.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Notwithstanding the six-month consultation period, we expect matters to be resolved by the end of the calendar year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So the bottom line is the fund continues as normal.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've also recently promoted three people to the leadership team, Menno Antal, Alan Giddins and Cressida Hogg, who you already heard from.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Menno has been a senior partner in the Buyout business and will take over leadership of the buyout fund and have geographical responsibility for Northern Europe.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Alan Giddins, who is also a senior partner in Buyouts and has also led our business services sector across the whole company, will have responsibility for the U.",1781
18511,"2010m11","and all our sector activities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We now have three strong platforms for growth, which can leverage our resources and expertise.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The growth of our Debt Management and Infrastructure businesses brings several benefits to 3i, not least in lowering potential volatility through generating increased revenue profits.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I want to give you a brief update on six of our largest investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There are some really common themes as to how they have generated growth and value in a recession.",1781
18511,"2010m11","These are international development, improved strategy and positioning, operational effectiveness and also following a buy and build strategy.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There are more details of these and other companies in your packs and on the IR website.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But let me introduce these companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","ACR is the pan-Asian reinsurer that we invested in, in 2006.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Today, it has premiums of USD $500 million and customers across 50 countries.",1781
18511,"2010m11","NORMA is a leading manufacturer of joining technology products and solutions.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It operates across 80 countries, and since we invested, has opened new plants in China, Thailand, Mexico, Russia and Serbia.",1781
18511,"2010m11","EBITDA has tripled during our investment period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Foster + Partners is one of the world's most innovative architectural practices, and since our investment has continued to expand internationally and has now delivered projects in 50 countries.",1781
18511,"2010m11","EBITDA has grown 68% since our investment in 2007.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Mémora is a leading funeral service provider in Spain and Portugal.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Through acquisitions, growth and operational improvement, EBITDA is up 21% from the time of our investment in 2008.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Mayborn may be well known to you through the its Tommee Tippee brand.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this business has grown internationally from virtually nothing when we invested, to 55% of sales today.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And the last of these six companies is Quintiles, the global market leader in outsourced clinical trial.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've supported what was already an outstanding company to grow further in Asia and Europe.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But let me return to the common themes.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In five out of these six, we supported their international development.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In all of them, our sector knowledge and ability to identify great people from our Business Leaders Network has either helped the company directly or given 3i particular insight into the opportunities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In all of them, our active partnership initiative is generating operational improvements, improving their strategic positions and building robust growth through acquisitions that are enhancing returns.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Together, these companies have a combined value of GBP 724 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And more and more of our portfolio companies we're making these initiatives deliver value for us.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Today, we focus on the first two elements of our strategy, investing and growing 3i.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In order to achieve these, it's absolutely critical that we do all that we can to ensure that 3i's reputation not only remains good, but that we build on it.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our success internationally owes much to the strength of our brand.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As you heard from Cressida, 3i's brand has been central to developing a strong position in the infrastructure market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i's reputation as a responsible investor is a core part of our brand and we'll be placing an increased emphasis on corporate responsibility, not just to the group level but also in all our portfolio companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","At our results presentation in May, I mentioned the One 3i approached that we've been driving through the business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The point of this was to increase our effectiveness, especially in terms of how we source opportunities, how we convert these opportunities into investments and then how we create value once invested.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This underpins all the other elements of our strategy.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And of course, the real test of whether this strategy delivers value will be our long-term financial performance and reputation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So let me turn to the outlook and our priorities for the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Predicting the macroeconomic outlook remains a challenge.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The important thing is that 3i is in a strong position to take advantage of either a sustained improvement or given our financial strength, to deal with further turbulence.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The outlook for our Private Equity business is improving.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Pricing will remain full.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I think that this will continue for another 12 to 18 months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But despite this, we can find good investments, as we've demonstrated with Trescal and Vedici.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As Cressida said, conditions in the infrastructure market in Europe and in India look favorable.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And as demonstrated by the two investments we've announced in the last week.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The outlook for the Debt Management business is also positive, with the opportunity to grow assets under management through new funds and further acquisitions.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The combination of the MIM team's track record and capabilities and 3i's brand and financial strength position us well to take advantage of these opportunities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So overall, the outlook for 3i is good, and we've therefore taken the opportunity to increase our dividend by 20%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In the short term, our priorities are to continue to deliver good financial performance, to integrate MIM, and to increase momentum in our investment activity.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So in conclusion, our key themes for today are: we've increased the momentum throughout the business; our portfolio has also delivered a good performance; we've made good progress in terms of strategic development; and we now have three strong platforms for growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I also said at the beginning, we've moved from planning and organizing growth to delivering growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Julia, Cressida and I would now be happy to take any questions that you've got.",1781
18511,"2010m11","[Operator Instructions] Is there anything else due to come through in the next few weeks? So the MWM transaction is expected to bring in about GBP 180 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So as Michael said on his slide, that's GBP 224 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Charles, one of the things that we've always seen in this business going through economic cycles is that the demand for growth capital picks up as you start to come out of the downturn.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So through the bottom of the market you don't actually see a lot of demand, and then you see demand pick up.",1781
18511,"2010m11","What's been unusual this time as we've started to see economic recovery, there's been a real reticence among businesses to actually invest, whether it's in a fixed plant and equipment, going out and buying new businesses.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now it's hard to say whether that trend is going to continue.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But it certainly surprised us that we haven't seen a stronger growth capital pickup, given where we are in the economic cycle.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And it maybe that the way that the banks have behaved has resulted in people being extremely nervous about entering into any new commitments going forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There is certainly an element of that.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But I would have to say, I just think that this position, this growth in demand for growth capital has simply been deferred.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And certainly, if we look at the work in progress that we're seeing and we're tracking this on a daily basis, we are seeing the early stage work in progress around growth capital is starting to pick up.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But I think it's too early to say whether that is an evidence of a trend.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But I think it's being deferred in the cycle and certainly happening later than we saw in previous cycles.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Are there any further questions? Well, if there aren't, as Patrick said, we wanted to conclude by 10:02.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And amazingly, we've done exactly that.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So thank you all very much for coming.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Julia, Cressida and I and Patrick are available all day for any other questions that you've got.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we look forward to seeing you over the next six months in our various one-on-one meetings.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So thank you, all, for coming.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Philip Middleton from Merrill.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Just kind of on that note of leakage between net portfolio return and ultimate return.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The net interest income was higher this half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In the statement, you talk about some one-offs due to repurchase of bits and pieces of debt.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Presumably those will improve the gross interest expense in the future.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Could you talk a little bit about the trajectory there please? Danny Garrod from Barclays Capital.",1781
18511,"2010m11","First, just following on from the set of provisions and impairment side, am I right in the detail of the text you do highlighted as health deterioration on the growth side of the portfolio, the percentage being down versus September versus March.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I wonder if you could give some specificity on  what's going on there? And secondly, you mentioned about expectation of H2 OpEx being higher than H1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Could you give a bit of color what's flat of the H1 or what's expected in H2, given the H1 is strongly below the run rate, shall we say, of last year? Bruce Hamilton, Morgan Stanley.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I mean, obviously, the earnings growth was a very good number in the period of up 8%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I guess some didn't move.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Given that, to achieve sort of 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","8% sort of return to shareholders, which is more of 5% if I x out the FX monies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","On the plate, it doesn't look that impressive.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I guess looking forward, if realizations will improve, should we also assume that the earnings growth will moderate? I mean, what would you expect as a more ""normal"" level of earnings growth? Or is sort of 15% per year something you think is achievable? [indiscernible] Michael, I understand what you're saying about pricing.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But even allowing for that, the level of investment in growth capital seems particularly low over the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Were there any reasons for that? And how do you see that going forward? Just with the OpEx point.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Actually, some of our costs are activity-related.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So as activity levels are building up in terms of investment and improvement in WIP, then I'm expecting to see some cost coming through that.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Effectively, what I'm saying to do is just don't double the number for the first half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There'll be a small increase on the first half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But overall, we're on a continuing downward trajectory.",1781
18511,"2010m11","If I talk about the first half in particular, one of the things I talked about is the conservative balance sheet management and trying to extend our maturities and manage those maturities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So one of the factors that you have in this period is the consequence of us refinancing in effect the convertible bond ahead of time.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So you remember we took advantage of the small window of opportunity in March to raise the GBP 350 million fixed rate bond that we have.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So you've got the interest cost of that coming in overlapping with the convertible bond in the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It's a consequence of actually our conservative balance sheet management.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The important thing is by next year, that overlap will have phased out.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And then I don't really want to go to the joys of IS39 accounting.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But one of the consequences of that in trying to manage the overlap I've talked about, we've been buying back our convertible bond in the market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The convertible bond has an amortization charge that comes through the total return statement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The consequence of buying it back early means that we've accelerated some of that amortization into the first half, so there's GBP 8 million of accelerated amortization sitting in those numbers.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The way I'm looking at is really looking through to next year, when all of these factors should have washed out, when we'll have a fixed interest cost of about GBP 50 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And that will be about half of our interest costs going forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","[indiscernible] Firstly, provisions and impairments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","These have increased again.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I think over the last two halves, they were actually positive, if I remember correctly.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Can you just give us a bit more color on that? How many assets are involved? And then the other question was on cash.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I mean, there are quite a number of sales that you've announced over the last few months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","If you project the cash that you're expecting to come in, how much is actually due to come in and be completed? Where will that then leave net debt? Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everybody.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me start my financial update by taking you through the highlights of the six months to September.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Investment at GBP 327 million was still at a relatively modest level, although it was significantly up from last year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our portfolio has performed well, with an improvement in earnings evaluation purposes of 8% in the six months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is the key driver of the 8.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7% gross portfolio return in the six months, despite lower multiples used to value the portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The benefits of the tough decisions we've taken in our own business is reflected in our operating costs, which have continued to fall.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our total return on opening shareholders funds at 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","8% was an encouraging result.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And consequently, the board has been approved an interim dividend of 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","2p per share, as we've taken the opportunity to reset our dividend at a higher lever.",1781
18511,"2010m11","NAV per share grew by 9p in the period to GBP 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Importantly, as Michael said, this is a 15% increase on a year ago.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we have finished the period with liquidity of more than GBP 2 billion and net debt of only GBP 352 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me give you some more detail on the investment of GBP 327 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We have invested GBP 58 million in two new businesses: Trescal, which is a European calibration service provider; and Vedici, the fifth-largest acute healthcare company in France.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In this very competitive market, both experience and will provide opportunities to buy and build.",1781
18511,"2010m11","More than the third in investment was made expanding the investment in our existing portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We continue to provide acquisition funding as we see our portfolio companies able to do transactions which are not subject to the same high prices we see elsewhere.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we've also taken the opportunity in two cases to buy senior debt and pick at discounted values.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Realizations of GBP 293 million were achieved as an 11% uplift over opening book value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The most significant individual transaction was the sale by Inspectorate of its global Commodity Testing and Inspection division.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As a result, we received proceeds of GBP 121 million and retained a top 30 investment, which is valued at GBP 42 million, which is now called ESG and is focused on environmental and food testing.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Despite the prevalence of secondary transactions in the market, almost all of our realizations with the non-financial buyers.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Looking then at the breakdown of our total return.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Gross portfolio return is the return we generate directly from our portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The GBP 307 million represents an 8.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7% return on opening portfolio value for the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It is driven by period performance in the portfolio, giving rise to unrealized profits of GBP 196 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","All our core business lines generated an 8% return in the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We then get to net portfolio return by reflecting the income and costs associated with the Asset Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So the GBP 236 million represents the gross portfolio return diluted by carry payable and operating expenses and enhanced by carry receivable and fund fee income.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Finally, total return takes account of the effects of our balance sheet structure.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So the GBP 117 million of return is achieved after deducting our cost of finance as well as a net exchange loss of GBP 29 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So turning then to the valuation of our portfolio and its effect on our returns in the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","You will see from this slide that most of the return in this period comes from the highest-quality factors, uplifts to sale and portfolio earnings growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This builds on the momentum in the second half of last year and represents a very different picture from that of 12 months ago.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The uplift on assets, which are in the process of being sold, was GBP 66 million in the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It includes the sale to Caterpillar of MWM, which is a German-headquartered global business supplying alternative engines.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This transaction is expected is complete by the end of the year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So this slide gives you some more detail on the earnings and multiple movements that we've used in our valuations exercise.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I've said before, the most striking aspect is the improvement in the quality of value growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Looking at the first line in the table, earnings used for the valuations grew by 8% in the first half, accounting for GBP 273 million of growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This followed a 5% increase in the second half of last year and compared to a 13% decline in the comparative period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This growth reflects the tough actions that our portfolio companies have been taking in the face of the considerable economic uncertainty that Michael has talked about in his statement this morning.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Markets were volatile in the six months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And overall, the market month pulls in the sectors and geographies in which we are invested fell during the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Consequently, the multiples we used in the valuations declined by 5%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This compares to a 10% increase in the second half of last year and a 21% increase in the comparative period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As usual, we've provided you with further analysis regarding our valuations in the appendices to your presentation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Before talking about the balance sheet, let me make a few comments on other components of total return.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Fund fee income generated is marginally up on the same period last year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is principally due to the launch of the growth capital fund at the end of March.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I mentioned earlier, we have taken tough actions ourselves to improve cost efficiency.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Operating costs were down to GBP 89 million for the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I do expect cost to be marginally higher in the second half, although the year-on-year trajectory remains down.",1781
18511,"2010m11","A GBP 29 million exchange loss was incurred in the first six months due to the strengthening of sterling.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The earning hedging in operation in the six-month period was that affected by our core currency borrowings.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As we've noted in our statement this morning, the board has recently decided to extend the hedging policy to include the use of derivatives.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is a limited extension and will not exceed 30% of the corresponding portfolio value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Implementation will be phased throughout the second half of this year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Turning then to the balance sheet.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've continued to adopt a conservative approach to our balance sheet management.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We set ourselves a limit on net debt of GBP 1 billion.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We have also set an objective of reducing our gross debt and managing maturities so that over time, maturities in any one year will be no more than GBP 300 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Consistent with that strategy, gross debt has been reduced by GBP 354 million through a series of actions, significantly, the repayments of GBP 195 million of the convertible bond and GBP 89 million of commercial paper.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we've continued with this activity since September.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There was an increase in net debt as a result of net cash outflow in the period due to operating activity.",1781
18511,"2010m11","However, the net debt of GBP 352 million is comfortably within our GBP 1 billion limit.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And the group's liquidity position remains very strong at GBP 2.",1781
18511,"2010m11","1 billion, meaning, we are well positioned for investment.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So in summary and to complete my review of the financial performance, we have seen good portfolio performance, driven by earnings improvements.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We have a continued focus on conservative balance sheet management, and we remain well positioned to manage against continuing uncertainty in the market and take advantage of investment opportunities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I'm now going to hand over to Cressida, who's going to update you on our Infrastructure business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Is there anything else due to come through in the next few weeks? Philip Middleton from Merrill.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Just kind of on that note of leakage between net portfolio return and ultimate return.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The net interest income was higher this half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In the statement, you talk about some one-offs due to repurchase of bits and pieces of debt.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Presumably those will improve the gross interest expense in the future.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Could you talk a little bit about the trajectory there please? In terms of the health of the portfolio, I mean, the general trend actually is positive.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We're seeing month by month continued overall trends.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The provisions numbers are slightly skewed because you get an individual company that has got specific issues relating to that company that will go through the provision that will make a difference to that figure.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So you can't necessarily draw conclusions across the portfolio from those individual numbers.",1781
18511,"2010m11","One company in the growth portfolio that was a sizable chunk of that provision number, actually, could come back very strongly, so we could end up at the 31st of March actually in effect reversing out some of that provision.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But we have a set policy that the company is performing in a particular way, we will make a provision.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But the key message is the underlying health of the portfolio is continuing to show steady improvement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thanks, Cressida.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I'd now like to update you on our strategic progress and then talk about the outlook and our priorities for the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The four key elements of our strategy, as set out on this slide, are also described in detail on our IR website as well as in our annual report.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And today, I want to mainly focus on two aspects of this strategy, investing and growing the business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me start with investment.",1781
18511,"2010m11","High-quality new investment is important to future value growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But the environment for making good investments has been challenging.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me explain what I mean by challenging.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Volume of private equity activity across Europe has been very low.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The number of transactions for both growth and buyouts is a third the level than it was in 2007.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But the funds available for investment continue to be very high, with the consequence that most transactions in Europe have been very high prices so we have an overhang of capital in our industry.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now in this environment, we've taken a measured and highly selective approach to the market and focused only on making investments where we feel we can make a significant impact on the performance of a particular company.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Trescal is a very good example of such a situation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It's a classic mid-market buyout in terms of size and profile.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Trescal is a French-based International business, providing calibration services for a wide range of industrial companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It has revenue of EUR 110 million and operates 60 laboratories in 11 countries.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We were able to invest through our strong relationship with the management, our experience having made several successful investments in the sector and the involvement of [indiscernible] from our business leaders network.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The investment case is based on four components.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Firstly, Trescal is in a growing sector, as many of its customers are looking to outsource testing and measurement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Secondly, because capital investment is required in building a company like Trescal, there are significant barriers to entry.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thirdly, through our active partnership analysis, we and management believe there's considerable opportunity for operational improvement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And finally, given its market position and a highly fragmented sector, there's a real opportunity for buy and build.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now increasing the level of investment is only one way to grow 3i's value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In addition, we must also continue to take every opportunity to grow the value of our existing portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Earnings growth in our portfolio is being good.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And one of the ways that our portfolio companies have been delivering this is to find opportunities in developing markets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MWM is a very good example of this.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MWM is a GBP 360 million euro buyout from Deutsche AG in 2007.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And it's a leading manufacturer of engines that are used to produce power.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now a typical use for an MWM engine is generating power from landfill gas sites, so there's huge demand for these products in the developing world.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our investment case was based on growth and significant operational improvement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And key to delivering this was the introduction of Peter Grosch, again from 3i's Business Leaders Network to lead a program of significant cultural change, alongside a number of 3i active partnership initiatives to improve MWM's strategic position and operational effectiveness.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Performance of the business has dramatically improved, and its market position has been strengthened.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this made it a really attractive acquisition target.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And last month, we announced that Caterpillar had agreed to purchase MWM for EUR 580 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now this sale which is subject to various regulatory approvals will deliver 2.",1781
18511,"2010m11","2x money multiple and proceeds of EUR 224 million to 3i Group, as well as an IRR of 25% for 3i and the investors in our Eurofund V.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In addition to making high-quality investments such as Trescal and MWM and doing everything we can to help these businesses grow their earnings and improve their strategic positioning, we've also been investing in 3i itself.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our Infrastructure business is a great example of this.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But another strategic investment is our Debt Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This started in 2005 with a small in-house team.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The team provides banking expertise to our deal teams and to our portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In addition, it invests in high-quality debt instruments in non-3i investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This team's been a major source of strength to 3i throughout the credit crisis and has added considerable value to our investment teams and our portfolio of companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Given this positive experience, we saw a real strategic opportunity to expand our debt investment and management activities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The acquisition of MIM from Mizuho was therefore a natural step.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MIM manages GBP 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7 billion of assets in eight funds of corporate, senior and subordinated debt.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The rationale to the deal was straightforward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MIM builds on 3i's existing debt management capabilities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MIM also brings an experienced team of 28 people to 3i, including Jeremy Ghose.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Jeremy will join our leadership team and head up the Debt Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This move creates a platform to manage multiple funds and provides the potential to diversify into other debt products, as well as the capacity to grow using 3i's balance sheet.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Strategically, the Debt Management business is important because like infrastructure, it provides the opportunity for a good source of low volatility returns with a significant yield component.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This next slide shows you the shape of the business once the MIM acquisition is complete, which we expect to be at the end of January 2011.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our Private Equity business is clearly the largest, with assets under management of GBP 7.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In September, we announced the decision to combine our Buyout and Growth Capital businesses to form a single Private Equity business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The rationale for this change was to ensure that we had the right model for a changing market and is based on ensuring we continue to develop our business model to maintain a sustainable competitive advantage.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our Buyout and Growth Capital businesses have the same mid-market focus, targeting companies with an enterprise value in the range of EUR 100 million to EUR 1 billion.",1781
18511,"2010m11","They have the same investment and management processes, and our teams adopt the same approach to achieving influence through being active members of the portfolio company boards.",1781
18511,"2010m11","They share the same active partnership approach to driving value, both use the group's network and sector expertise and both draw on our Business Leaders Network members.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now another important driver of this decision was our view on what the next generation of private equity funds might look like.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our view was that there's an evolution towards more regionally-based funds and that most LPs are more focused on making geographic allocations than the distinction between majority and minority private equity investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've also been preparing for the next generation of leadership in our investment business, and I'll say more on that in a minute.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This change has been welcomed by professional advisors, management teams, our Business Leaders Network and our own people.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The feedback that we've had is it will make 3i easier to understand and easier to deal with.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this is critical in a highly competitive market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've been actively communicating with our LP investors in both our buyout and growth funds.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we are, of course, committed to managing these funds on the same basis through to the end of their investing periods.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now following these changes this quarter, we're in a six-month consultation period with our Eurofund V Advisory Board.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Those discussions are constructive and include the possibility of potentially extending the fund for one year beyond November 2011.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Notwithstanding the six-month consultation period, we expect matters to be resolved by the end of the calendar year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So the bottom line is the fund continues as normal.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've also recently promoted three people to the leadership team, Menno Antal, Alan Giddins and Cressida Hogg, who you already heard from.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Menno has been a senior partner in the Buyout business and will take over leadership of the buyout fund and have geographical responsibility for Northern Europe.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Alan Giddins, who is also a senior partner in Buyouts and has also led our business services sector across the whole company, will have responsibility for the U.",1781
18511,"2010m11","and all our sector activities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We now have three strong platforms for growth, which can leverage our resources and expertise.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The growth of our Debt Management and Infrastructure businesses brings several benefits to 3i, not least in lowering potential volatility through generating increased revenue profits.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I want to give you a brief update on six of our largest investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There are some really common themes as to how they have generated growth and value in a recession.",1781
18511,"2010m11","These are international development, improved strategy and positioning, operational effectiveness and also following a buy and build strategy.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There are more details of these and other companies in your packs and on the IR website.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But let me introduce these companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","ACR is the pan-Asian reinsurer that we invested in, in 2006.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Today, it has premiums of USD $500 million and customers across 50 countries.",1781
18511,"2010m11","NORMA is a leading manufacturer of joining technology products and solutions.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It operates across 80 countries, and since we invested, has opened new plants in China, Thailand, Mexico, Russia and Serbia.",1781
18511,"2010m11","EBITDA has tripled during our investment period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Foster + Partners is one of the world's most innovative architectural practices, and since our investment has continued to expand internationally and has now delivered projects in 50 countries.",1781
18511,"2010m11","EBITDA has grown 68% since our investment in 2007.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Mémora is a leading funeral service provider in Spain and Portugal.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Through acquisitions, growth and operational improvement, EBITDA is up 21% from the time of our investment in 2008.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Mayborn may be well known to you through the its Tommee Tippee brand.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this business has grown internationally from virtually nothing when we invested, to 55% of sales today.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And the last of these six companies is Quintiles, the global market leader in outsourced clinical trial.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've supported what was already an outstanding company to grow further in Asia and Europe.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But let me return to the common themes.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In five out of these six, we supported their international development.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In all of them, our sector knowledge and ability to identify great people from our Business Leaders Network has either helped the company directly or given 3i particular insight into the opportunities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In all of them, our active partnership initiative is generating operational improvements, improving their strategic positions and building robust growth through acquisitions that are enhancing returns.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Together, these companies have a combined value of GBP 724 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And more and more of our portfolio companies we're making these initiatives deliver value for us.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Today, we focus on the first two elements of our strategy, investing and growing 3i.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In order to achieve these, it's absolutely critical that we do all that we can to ensure that 3i's reputation not only remains good, but that we build on it.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our success internationally owes much to the strength of our brand.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As you heard from Cressida, 3i's brand has been central to developing a strong position in the infrastructure market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i's reputation as a responsible investor is a core part of our brand and we'll be placing an increased emphasis on corporate responsibility, not just to the group level but also in all our portfolio companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","At our results presentation in May, I mentioned the One 3i approached that we've been driving through the business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The point of this was to increase our effectiveness, especially in terms of how we source opportunities, how we convert these opportunities into investments and then how we create value once invested.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This underpins all the other elements of our strategy.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And of course, the real test of whether this strategy delivers value will be our long-term financial performance and reputation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So let me turn to the outlook and our priorities for the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Predicting the macroeconomic outlook remains a challenge.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The important thing is that 3i is in a strong position to take advantage of either a sustained improvement or given our financial strength, to deal with further turbulence.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The outlook for our Private Equity business is improving.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Pricing will remain full.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I think that this will continue for another 12 to 18 months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But despite this, we can find good investments, as we've demonstrated with Trescal and Vedici.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As Cressida said, conditions in the infrastructure market in Europe and in India look favorable.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And as demonstrated by the two investments we've announced in the last week.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The outlook for the Debt Management business is also positive, with the opportunity to grow assets under management through new funds and further acquisitions.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The combination of the MIM team's track record and capabilities and 3i's brand and financial strength position us well to take advantage of these opportunities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So overall, the outlook for 3i is good, and we've therefore taken the opportunity to increase our dividend by 20%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In the short term, our priorities are to continue to deliver good financial performance, to integrate MIM, and to increase momentum in our investment activity.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So in conclusion, our key themes for today are: we've increased the momentum throughout the business; our portfolio has also delivered a good performance; we've made good progress in terms of strategic development; and we now have three strong platforms for growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I also said at the beginning, we've moved from planning and organizing growth to delivering growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Julia, Cressida and I would now be happy to take any questions that you've got.",1781
18511,"2010m11","[Operator Instructions] And just going back on the cash, if we take into account transactions such as MWM, how much cash is still to come through on deals that haven't completed yet? [indiscernible] Michael, I understand what you're saying about pricing.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But even allowing for that, the level of investment in growth capital seems particularly low over the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Were there any reasons for that? And how do you see that going forward? That's the most significant transaction coming through.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Michael, you were talking about pricing remaining full.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Can you talk about the prospects for upselling some assets into that strength in the second half? I mean, obviously, there have been a few press stories about one or two of your assets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thanks, Patrick.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Half Yearly Results Presentation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is our agenda for today.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I'm going to give a short introduction, and then Julia will present a financial review of the first half year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Cressida Hogg, who's our managing partner of the Infrastructure business, will then give you an overview of this important part of 3i's investment activity.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And finally, I'll review our strategic progress and cover the outlook and priorities for the next six months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I said in the statement this morning, we've increased momentum throughout the business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our portfolio has delivered a good performance, achieving a gross portfolio return of 8.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7% for the six months until the 30th of September.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Total return was lower at 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","8%, although NAV growth over the last 12 months is over 15%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've made good progress in terms of strategic development, and we now have three strong platforms for growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In my last few presentations to you, I've talked about planning and organizing for growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've now moved into the delivery phase.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I'll give you more detail on this later.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But before that, Julia will review our financial performance.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Well, I think what we're looking to do overall is deliver 15% returns to shareholders.",1781
18511,"2010m11","That will come in a combination of forms, will come from the earnings growth on the portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We typically do see a step-up when we sell assets open above the carrying value, so that gives an additional boost to return; and of course, from the income streams from managing third-party assets, which clearly will start to rise as we incorporate the Debt Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I think if you look at this half year's performance, I mean, the way I try and look at this is to sort of x out multiple movement, both up and down, whether year and a half, half-year period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And so I think what they're all about in terms of the overall consistency with that delivery of that trend.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I think we're learning to live with an environment where everything a financial company does is immediately reported in the press.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So you have a pretty good view on the pipeline of potential realizations that are coming forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","What I can say is when we look at the assets that have been talked about, a number of our big industrial companies, particularly in Continental Europe, we expect to achieve extremely attractive prices for these assets because they are really high quality businesses.",1781
18511,"2010m11","One of the businesses that's being talked about that I referred to, NORMA, is just a sensational business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","That has a potential to be a very, very strong IPO candidate, not just a potential trade sale.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It's a very attractive business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And the reason it's attractive is because it's got great exposure to developing markets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","One of the things that we'd be pushing across all of our industrial portfolio is where they haven't already got strong market access in India, China or South America, really helping them to move that forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And that's what makes these assets very attractive.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I mean, one of the themes that we've been focused on is how do we access that developing market growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I think there are two ways to do that.",1781
18511,"2010m11","One is to invest directly in Asian companies, which clearly we're doing as in GBK, but the other is to make sure our great European businesses are also accessing that growth, and therefore we can benefit in that one as well.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So if I take your question on provisions and impairments, first, I mean, clearly, you're right.",1781
18511,"2010m11","If you compare the numbers to last year, then it doesn't look like a particularly good shift.",1781
18511,"2010m11","What it would say is clearly last year had almost the benefit of the previous year where we've had some very, very significant provisions and impairment.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So I'd say last year was unusually low.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this year, the provision level is 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","1% of opening portfolio value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","That's an unusual sort of amount.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In terms of the underlying movement sort of in there, it's a small number of assets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There's no particular themes that I can draw out for you that's spread across the business lines, that's spread across sectors and spread across geographies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The specific factors to particular investments and don't actually indicate any underlying trend for the overall portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And then in terms of cash for the period, I mean, clearly there are, as Michael has said, there was a number of transactions that are being well trailed in the market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Without trying to give you a specific number where we expect cash to be because we would like actually to be investing in the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So it's realistic to assume that there will be some significant realizations coming through.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But in terms of where net debt's going to be, I would hope that we would actually be putting in some decent amount of investment in the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Some of that will come down to timing.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Where we're talking about smaller numbers of large transactions, we can get quite different numbers coming over the year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So I would hope that we would have investment, but clearly this number of realizations going through.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Bruce Hamilton, Morgan Stanley.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I mean, obviously, the earnings growth was a very good number in the period of up 8%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I guess some didn't move.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Given that, to achieve sort of 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","8% sort of return to shareholders, which is more of 5% if I x out the FX monies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","On the plate, it doesn't look that impressive.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I guess looking forward, if realizations will improve, should we also assume that the earnings growth will moderate? I mean, what would you expect as a more ""normal"" level of earnings growth? Or is sort of 15% per year something you think is achievable? Danny Garrod from Barclays Capital.",1781
18511,"2010m11","First, just following on from the set of provisions and impairment side, am I right in the detail of the text you do highlighted as health deterioration on the growth side of the portfolio, the percentage being down versus September versus March.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I wonder if you could give some specificity on  what's going on there? And secondly, you mentioned about expectation of H2 OpEx being higher than H1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Could you give a bit of color what's flat of the H1 or what's expected in H2, given the H1 is strongly below the run rate, shall we say, of last year? So the MWM transaction is expected to bring in about GBP 180 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So as Michael said on his slide, that's GBP 224 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thank you, Julia, and good morning.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i has grown and established a profitable Infrastructure business from small beginnings.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We started investing in infrastructure-type assets through our private equity business that set up Infrastructure as a separate business line in 2005, as the market increasingly began to view infrastructure as a distinct asset class in its own right.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Since then, we've used 3i's investment expertise and capital to make infrastructure investments and to see two external funds, which now have combined assets under management of approximately GBP 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This slide gives more detail on our two infrastructure investment vehicles.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i Infrastructure PLC, in which we have a 33% holding, is a listed investment company, with a market cap and net assets of just under GBP 1 billion.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Its overall objective is to provide shareholders with a total return, net of costs, of 12% per annum when fully invested, with 5% distributors of yield.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The company's focus is on core infrastructure, which we define as assets with stable contracted revenues or some sort of regulatory protection, principally in the transportation and utility space.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It also has exposure to social infrastructure assets and to the Indian infrastructure market, through a commitment of 3i India Infrastructure Fund.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i Infrastructure's portfolio provides a high degree of inflation linkage, strong income generation, and opportunities for capital growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The company last week announced a new investment in Eversholt Rail Group and now has an investment portfolio of 15 assets worth around GBP 800 million and remaining cash balances of GBP 138 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The 3i India Infrastructure Funds, in which both 3i Group and 3i Infrastructure have a GBP 250 million commitment, is a GBP 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","2 billion LP fund established to access the growing infrastructure market in India.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It focuses on the port, airport, road and power sectors.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And its objective is to deliver an 18% net returns to its investors.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Following the announcement of a new investment in GBK Energy on Monday, the fund is now over 50% invested in four assets, including two power generation developers, a port, and a road constructor and operator.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our two external funds have now established a very strong track record and a good reputation in the market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","With its focus on mature infrastructure assets in developed economies, 3i Infrastructure has built a robust cash-generated portfolio, which has delivered a 9.",1781
18511,"2010m11","5% annualized growth in returns since inception during a period of great market volatility.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Importantly, it has also delivered its 5% yield objective in every year since inception.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And our India funds, with its focus on early-stage infrastructure assets in one fastest-growing economies in the world, is now valued at 56% above cost and has delivered a gross ROI since inception of nearly 20% so far, in line with its long-term return objectives.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Many of our LPs have singled this fund out as one of their best performing investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Julia has just taken you through 3i's return model, and this slide shows how the total return to infrastructure is generated.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i does not invest in infrastructure assets directly, but through 3i Infrastructure and through the India Fund.",1781
18511,"2010m11","These two contribute to do gross portfolio return in the same way as any other asset, through the realized and unrealized value movements and through dividends and capital returns.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i also generates advisory and performance fees from 3i infrastructure and management fees and carry from the India Fund.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This income is partly offset by the carry payables of the investment team and by the cost of running the business line, which consist mostly of staff costs.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Being part of 3i has been key to the success of the Infrastructure business line.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i's brand and investment track record are recognized beyond private equity, and its people and network provide unparalleled access to opportunities, as well as to investments in portfolio management expertise.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is a strong platform from which to expand our business going forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I now wanted to give you a little more detail on 3i Infrastructure's new investment in Eversholt Rail Group, as it provides a flavor of the type of asset that we invest in.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Eversholt is one of the three leading rail rolling stock companies or ROSCOs in the U.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i infrastructure, in a consortium with Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and Star Capital Partners, is acquiring 100% of the equity.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i infrastructure will be contributing up to GBP 176 million in equity instruments to finance the purchase, which in total values Eversholt's assets at around GBP 2.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Eversholt currently owns 29% of the British Royal Fleet.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Its 19 fleets at least to seven train operating companies or TOCs.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And its primary revenue stream consists of lease payments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The company has strong infrastructure characteristics and fits in 3i Infrastructure's investment mandate as a mature cash-generative assets with stable contracted revenues for the following reasons.",1781
18511,"2010m11","First, the market fundamentals are strong because the fleet is fully utilized following a decade of passenger growth, and the government is unlikely to procure many new trains in the near term due to budgetary constraints.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Second, Eversholt itself has strong fundamentals, with high-quality cash flows that are contracted for the medium-term.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Third, Eversholt has high margins with a low cost base.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And finally, Eversholt has a defensive diversified fleet portfolio with an impressive operational history.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In summary, Eversholt offers an exposure to a profitable transport asset with stable contracted revenues, a strong market position, and defensive characteristics.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now I'd like to look forward to the market opportunity in our key geographical regions: Europe, North America and India.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The market opportunity in Europe and North America is driven by similar factors.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The focus on deficit reduction will drive an increased flow of government disposals and potentially PFI opportunities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The recent government auction of HS1 in the U.",1781
18511,"2010m11","is a case in point.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The flow of non-core disposals by corporate and financial institutions is continuing and our recent investment in Eversholt, which we purchased from HSBC is an example of this.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The cyclical recovery has de-risked some assets with a higher GDP correlation, making them more attractive to infrastructure investors like ourselves.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And finally, there are policy drivers that may result in new opportunities, such as the use of infrastructure spending for economic stimulus and the incentivization of the green economy.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our current pipeline includes opportunities in all these categories.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The opportunity in India will continue to be driven by the growing infrastructure deficit.",1781
18511,"2010m11","A combination of GDP growth and expanding population and increasing organization, means that the Indian government is struggling to keep up with the demand for new build infrastructure.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There is significant political momentum to tackle this however.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The Indian government is putting a strong emphasis on private sector participation and partnership in building out infrastructure assets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Through the India Fund, we are progressing a very attractive pipeline of opportunities, and some of these have reached the advanced stage.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Just with the OpEx point.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Actually, some of our costs are activity-related.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So as activity levels are building up in terms of investment and improvement in WIP, then I'm expecting to see some cost coming through that.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Effectively, what I'm saying to do is just don't double the number for the first half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There'll be a small increase on the first half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But overall, we're on a continuing downward trajectory.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Charles, one of the things that we've always seen in this business going through economic cycles is that the demand for growth capital picks up as you start to come out of the downturn.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So through the bottom of the market you don't actually see a lot of demand, and then you see demand pick up.",1781
18511,"2010m11","What's been unusual this time as we've started to see economic recovery, there's been a real reticence among businesses to actually invest, whether it's in a fixed plant and equipment, going out and buying new businesses.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now it's hard to say whether that trend is going to continue.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But it certainly surprised us that we haven't seen a stronger growth capital pickup, given where we are in the economic cycle.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And it maybe that the way that the banks have behaved has resulted in people being extremely nervous about entering into any new commitments going forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There is certainly an element of that.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But I would have to say, I just think that this position, this growth in demand for growth capital has simply been deferred.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And certainly, if we look at the work in progress that we're seeing and we're tracking this on a daily basis, we are seeing the early stage work in progress around growth capital is starting to pick up.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But I think it's too early to say whether that is an evidence of a trend.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But I think it's being deferred in the cycle and certainly happening later than we saw in previous cycles.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Are there any further questions? Well, if there aren't, as Patrick said, we wanted to conclude by 10:02.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And amazingly, we've done exactly that.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So thank you all very much for coming.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Julia, Cressida and I and Patrick are available all day for any other questions that you've got.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we look forward to seeing you over the next six months in our various one-on-one meetings.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So thank you, all, for coming.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thanks, Cressida.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I'd now like to update you on our strategic progress and then talk about the outlook and our priorities for the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The four key elements of our strategy, as set out on this slide, are also described in detail on our IR website as well as in our annual report.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And today, I want to mainly focus on two aspects of this strategy, investing and growing the business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me start with investment.",1781
18511,"2010m11","High-quality new investment is important to future value growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But the environment for making good investments has been challenging.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me explain what I mean by challenging.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Volume of private equity activity across Europe has been very low.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The number of transactions for both growth and buyouts is a third the level than it was in 2007.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But the funds available for investment continue to be very high, with the consequence that most transactions in Europe have been very high prices so we have an overhang of capital in our industry.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now in this environment, we've taken a measured and highly selective approach to the market and focused only on making investments where we feel we can make a significant impact on the performance of a particular company.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Trescal is a very good example of such a situation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It's a classic mid-market buyout in terms of size and profile.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Trescal is a French-based International business, providing calibration services for a wide range of industrial companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It has revenue of EUR 110 million and operates 60 laboratories in 11 countries.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We were able to invest through our strong relationship with the management, our experience having made several successful investments in the sector and the involvement of [indiscernible] from our business leaders network.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The investment case is based on four components.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Firstly, Trescal is in a growing sector, as many of its customers are looking to outsource testing and measurement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Secondly, because capital investment is required in building a company like Trescal, there are significant barriers to entry.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thirdly, through our active partnership analysis, we and management believe there's considerable opportunity for operational improvement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And finally, given its market position and a highly fragmented sector, there's a real opportunity for buy and build.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now increasing the level of investment is only one way to grow 3i's value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In addition, we must also continue to take every opportunity to grow the value of our existing portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Earnings growth in our portfolio is being good.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And one of the ways that our portfolio companies have been delivering this is to find opportunities in developing markets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MWM is a very good example of this.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MWM is a GBP 360 million euro buyout from Deutsche AG in 2007.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And it's a leading manufacturer of engines that are used to produce power.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now a typical use for an MWM engine is generating power from landfill gas sites, so there's huge demand for these products in the developing world.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our investment case was based on growth and significant operational improvement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And key to delivering this was the introduction of Peter Grosch, again from 3i's Business Leaders Network to lead a program of significant cultural change, alongside a number of 3i active partnership initiatives to improve MWM's strategic position and operational effectiveness.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Performance of the business has dramatically improved, and its market position has been strengthened.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this made it a really attractive acquisition target.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And last month, we announced that Caterpillar had agreed to purchase MWM for EUR 580 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now this sale which is subject to various regulatory approvals will deliver 2.",1781
18511,"2010m11","2x money multiple and proceeds of EUR 224 million for 3i Group, as well as an IRR of 25% for 3i and the investors in our Eurofund V.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In addition to making high-quality investments such as Trescal and MWM and doing everything we can to help these businesses grow their earnings and improve their strategic positioning, we've also been investing in 3i itself.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our Infrastructure business is a great example of this.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But another strategic investment is our Debt Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This started in 2005 with a small in-house team.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The team provides banking expertise to our deal teams and to our portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In addition, it invests in high-quality debt instruments in non-3i investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This team's been a major source of strength to 3i throughout the credit crisis and has added considerable value to our investment teams and our portfolio of companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Given this positive experience, we saw a real strategic opportunity to expand our debt investment and management activities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The acquisition of MIM from Mizuho was therefore a natural step.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MIM manages GBP 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7 billion of assets in eight funds of corporate, senior and subordinated debt.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The rationale for the deal was straightforward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MIM builds on 3i's existing debt management capabilities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MIM also brings an experienced team of 28 people to 3i, including Jeremy Ghose.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Jeremy will join our leadership team and head up the Debt Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This move creates a platform to manage multiple funds and provides the potential to diversify into other debt products, as well as the capacity to grow using 3i's balance sheet.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Strategically, the Debt Management business is important because like infrastructure, it provides the opportunity for a good source of low volatility returns with a significant yield component.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This next slide shows you the shape of the business once the MIM acquisition is complete, which we expect to be at the end of January 2011.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our Private Equity business is clearly the largest, with assets under management of GBP 7.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In September, we announced the decision to combine our Buyout and Growth Capital businesses to form a single Private Equity business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The rationale for this change was to ensure that we had the right model for a changing market and is based on ensuring we continue to develop our business model to maintain a sustainable competitive advantage.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our Buyout and Growth Capital businesses have the same mid-market focus, targeting companies with an enterprise value in the range of EUR 100 million to EUR 1 billion.",1781
18511,"2010m11","They have the same investment and management processes, and our teams adopt the same approach to achieving influence through being active members of the portfolio company boards.",1781
18511,"2010m11","They share the same active partnership approach to driving value, both use the group's network and sector expertise and both draw on our Business Leaders Network members.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now another important driver of this decision was our view on what the next generation of private equity funds might look like.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our view was that there's an evolution towards more regionally-based funds and that most LPs are more focused on making geographic allocations than the distinction between majority and minority private equity investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've also been preparing for the next generation of leadership in our investment business, and I'll say more on that in a minute.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This change has been welcomed by professional advisors, management teams, our Business Leaders Network and our own people.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The feedback that we've had is it will make 3i easier to understand and easier to deal with.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this is critical in a highly competitive market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've been actively communicating with our LP investors in both our buyout and growth funds.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we are, of course, committed to managing these funds on the same basis through to the end of their investing periods.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now following these changes this autumn, we're in a six-month consultation period with our Eurofund V Advisory Board.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Those discussions are constructive and include the possibility of potentially extending the fund for one year beyond November 2011.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Notwithstanding the six-month consultation period, we expect matters to be resolved by the end of the calendar year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So the bottom line is the fund continues as normal.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've also recently promoted three people to the leadership team, Menno Antal, Alan Giddins and Cressida Hogg, who you already heard from.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Menno has been a senior partner in the Buyout business and will take over leadership of the buyout fund and have geographical responsibility for Northern Europe.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Alan Giddins, who is also a senior partner in Buyouts and has also led our business services sector across the whole company, will have, responsibility for the U.",1781
18511,"2010m11","and all our sector activities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We now have three strong platforms for growth, which can leverage our resources and expertise.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The growth of our Debt Management and Infrastructure businesses brings several benefits to 3i, not least in lowering potential volatility through generating increased revenue profits.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I want to give you a brief update on six of our largest investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There are some really common themes as to how they have generated growth and value in a recession.",1781
18511,"2010m11","These are international development, improved strategy and positioning, operational effectiveness and also following a buy and build strategy.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There are more details of these and other companies in your packs and on the IR website.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But let me introduce these companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","ACR is the pan-Asian reinsurer that we invested in, in 2006.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Today, it has premiums of USD $500 million and customers across 50 countries.",1781
18511,"2010m11","NORMA is a leading manufacturer of joining technology products and solutions.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It operates across 80 countries, and since we invested, has opened new plants in China, Thailand, Mexico, Russia and Serbia.",1781
18511,"2010m11","EBITDA has tripled during our investment period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Foster + Partners is one of the world's most innovative architectural practices, and since our investment has continued to expand internationally and has now delivered projects in 50 countries.",1781
18511,"2010m11","EBITDA has grown 68% since our investment in 2007.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Mémora is a leading funeral service provider in Spain and Portugal.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Through acquisitions, growth and operational improvement, EBITDA is up 21% from the time of our investment in 2008.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Mayborn may be well known to you through the its Tommee Tippee brand.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this business has grown internationally from virtually nothing when we invested, to 55% of sales today.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And the last of these six companies is Quintiles, the global market leader in outsourced clinical trial.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've supported what was already an outstanding company to grow further in Asia and Europe.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But let me return to the common themes.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In five out of these six, we supported their international development.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In all of them, our sector knowledge and ability to identify great people from our Business Leaders Network has either helped the company directly or given 3i particular insight into the opportunities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In all of them, our active partnership initiative is generating operational improvements, improving their strategic positions and building robust growth through acquisitions that are enhancing returns.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Together, these companies have a combined value of GBP 724 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And more and more of our portfolio companies we're making these initiatives deliver value for us.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Today, we focus on the first two elements of our strategy, investing and growing 3i.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In order to achieve these, it's absolutely critical that we do all that we can to ensure that 3i's reputation not only remains good, but that we build on it.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our success internationally owes much to the strength of our brand.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As you heard from Cressida, 3i's brand has been central to developing a strong position in the infrastructure market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i's reputation as a responsible investor is a core part of our brand and we'll be placing an increased emphasis on corporate responsibility, not just to the group level but also in all our portfolio companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","At our results presentation in May, I mentioned the One 3i approach that we've been driving through the business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The point of this was to increase our effectiveness, especially in terms of how we source opportunities, how we convert these opportunities into investments and then how we create value once invested.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This underpins all the other elements of our strategy.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And of course, the real test of whether this strategy delivers value will be our long-term financial performance and reputation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So let me turn to the outlook and our priorities for the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Predicting the macroeconomic outlook remains a challenge.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The important thing is that 3i is in a strong position to take advantage of either a sustained improvement or given our financial strength, to deal with further turbulence.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thank you, Julia, and good morning.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i has grown and established a profitable Infrastructure business from small beginnings.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We started investing in infrastructure-type assets through our private equity business that set up Infrastructure as a separate business line in 2005, as the market increasingly began to view infrastructure as a distinct asset class in its own right.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Since then, we've used 3i's investment expertise and capital to make infrastructure investments and to see two external funds, which now have combined assets under management of approximately GBP 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This slide gives more detail on our two infrastructure investment vehicles.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i Infrastructure PLC, in which we have a 33% holding, is a listed investment company, with a market cap and net assets of just under GBP 1 billion.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Its overall objective is to provide shareholders with a total return, net of costs, of 12% per annum when fully invested, with 5% distributors of yield.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The company's focus is on core infrastructure, which we define as assets with stable contracted revenues or some sort of regulatory protection, principally in the transportation and utility space.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It also has exposure to social infrastructure assets and to the Indian infrastructure market, through a commitment of 3i India Infrastructure Fund.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i Infrastructure's portfolio provides a high degree of inflation linkage, strong income generation, and opportunities for capital growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The company last week announced a new investment in Eversholt Rail Group and now has an investment portfolio of 15 assets worth around GBP 800 million and remaining cash balances of GBP 138 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The 3i India Infrastructure Fund, in which both 3i Group and 3i Infrastructure have a GBP 250 million commitment, is a GBP 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","2 billion LP fund established to access the growing infrastructure market in India.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It focuses on the port, airport, road and power sectors.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And its objective is to deliver an 18% net returns to its investors.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Following the announcement of a new investment in GBK Energy on Monday, the fund is now over 50% invested in four assets, including two power generation developers, a port, and a road constructor and operator.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our two external funds have now established a very strong track record and a good reputation in the market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","With its focus on mature infrastructure assets in developed economies, 3i Infrastructure has built a robust cash-generative portfolio, which has delivered a 9.",1781
18511,"2010m11","5% annualized growth in returns since inception during a period of great market volatility.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Importantly, it has also delivered its 5% yield objective in every year since inception.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And our India funds, with its focus on early-stage infrastructure assets in one fastest-growing economies in the world, is now valued at 56% above cost and has delivered a gross ROI since inception of nearly 20% so far, in line with its long-term return objectives.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Many of our LPs have singled this fund out as one of their best performing investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Julia has just taken you through 3i's return model, and this slide shows how the total return to infrastructure is generated.",1781

18511,"2010m11","This is our agenda for today.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I'm going to give a short introduction, and then Julia will present a financial review of the first half year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Cressida Hogg, who's our managing partner of the Infrastructure business, will then give you an overview of this important part of 3i's investment activity.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And finally, I'll review our strategic progress and cover the outlook and priorities for the next six months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I said in the statement this morning, we've increased momentum throughout the business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our portfolio has delivered a good performance, achieving a gross portfolio return of 8.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7% for the six months until the 30th of September.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Total return was lower at 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","8%, although NAV growth over the last 12 months is over 15%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've made good progress in terms of strategic development, and we now have three strong platforms for growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In my last few presentations to you, I've talked about planning and organizing for growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've now moved into the delivery phase.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I'll give you more detail on this later.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But before that, Julia will review our financial performance.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everybody.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me start my financial update by taking you through the highlights of the six months to September.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Investment at GBP 327 million was still at a relatively modest level, although it was significantly up from last year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our portfolio has performed well, with an improvement in earnings used for evaluation purposes of 8% in the six months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is a key driver of the 8.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7% gross portfolio return in the six months, despite lower multiples used to value the portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The benefits of the tough decisions we've taken in our own business is reflected in our operating costs, which have continued to fall.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our total return on opening shareholders funds at 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","8% was an encouraging result.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And consequently, the board has an approved an interim dividend of 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","2p per share, as we've taken the opportunity to reset our dividend at a higher level.",1781
18511,"2010m11","NAV per share grew by 9p in the period to GBP 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Importantly, as Michael said, this is a 15% increase on a year ago.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we have finished the period with liquidity of more than GBP 2 billion and net debt of only GBP 352 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me give you some more detail on the investment of GBP 327 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We have invested GBP 58 million in two new businesses: Trescal, which is a European calibration service provider; and Vedici, the fifth-largest acute healthcare company in France.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In this very competitive market, both experience and will provide opportunities to buy and build.",1781
18511,"2010m11","More than the third in investment was made expanding the investment in our existing portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We continue to provide acquisition funding as we see our portfolio companies able to do transactions which are not subject to the same high prices we see elsewhere.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we've also taken the opportunity in two cases to buy senior debt and pick at discounted values.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Realizations of GBP 293 million were achieved as an 11% uplift over opening book value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The most significant individual transaction was the sale by Inspectorate of its global Commodity Testing and Inspection division.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As a result, we received proceeds of GBP 121 million and retained a top 30 investment, which is valued at GBP 42 million, which is now called ESG and is focused on environmental and food testing.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Despite the prevalence of secondary transactions in the market, almost all of our realizations with the non-financial buyers.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Looking then at the breakdown of our total return.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Gross portfolio return is the return we generate directly from our portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The GBP 307 million represents an 8.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7% return on opening portfolio value for the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It is driven by period performance in the portfolio, giving rise to unrealized profits of GBP 196 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","All our core business lines generated an 8% return in the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We then get to net portfolio return by reflecting the income and costs associated with the Asset Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So the GBP 236 million represents the gross portfolio return diluted by carry payable and operating expenses and enhanced by carry receivable and fund fee income.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Finally, total return takes account of the effects of our balance sheet structure.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So the GBP 117 million of return is achieved after deducting our cost of finance as well as a net exchange loss of GBP 29 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So turning then to the valuation of our portfolio and its effect on our returns in the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","You will see from this slide that most of the return in this period comes from the highest-quality factors, uplifts to sale and portfolio earnings growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This builds on the momentum in the second half of last year and represents a very different picture from that of 12 months ago.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The uplift on assets, which are in the process of being sold, was GBP 66 million in the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It includes the sale to Caterpillar of MWM, which is a German-headquartered global business supplying alternative engines.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This transaction is expected is complete by the end of the year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So this slide gives you some more detail on the earnings and multiple movements that we've used in our valuations exercise.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I've said before, the most striking aspect is the improvement in the quality of value growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Looking at the first line in the table, earnings used for the valuations grew by 8% in the first half, accounting for GBP 273 million of growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This follows a 5% increase in the second half of last year and compared to a 13% decline in the comparative period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This growth reflects the tough actions that our portfolio companies have been taking in the face of the considerable economic uncertainty that Michael has talked about in his statement this morning.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Markets were volatile in the six months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And overall, the market month pulls in the sectors and geographies in which we are invested fell during the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Consequently, the multiples we used in the valuations declined by 5%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This compares to a 10% increase in the second half of last year and a 21% increase in the comparative period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As usual, we've provided you with further analysis regarding our valuations in the appendices to your presentation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Before talking about the balance sheet, let me make a few comments on other components of total return.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Fund fee income generated is marginally up on the same period last year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is principally due to the launch of the growth capital fund at the end of March.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I mentioned earlier, we have taken tough actions ourselves to improve cost efficiency.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Operating costs were down to GBP 89 million for the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I do expect cost to be marginally higher in the second half, although the year-on-year trajectory remains down.",1781
18511,"2010m11","A GBP 29 million exchange loss was incurred in the first six months due to the strengthening of sterling.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The earning hedging in operation in the six-month period was that affected by our core currency borrowings.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As we've noted in our statement this morning, the board has recently decided to extend the hedging policy to include the use of derivatives.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is a limited extension and will not exceed 30% of the corresponding portfolio value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Implementation will be phased throughout the second half of this year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Turning then to the balance sheet.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've continued to adopt a conservative approach to our balance sheet management.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We set ourselves a limit on net debt of GBP 1 billion.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We have also set an objective of reducing our gross debt and managing maturities so that over time, maturities in any one year will be no more than GBP 300 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Consistent with that strategy, gross debt has been reduced by GBP 354 million through a series of actions, significantly, the repayments of GBP 195 million of the convertible bond and GBP 89 million of commercial paper.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we've continued with this activity since September.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There was an increase in net debt as a result of net cash outflow in the period due to operating activity.",1781
18511,"2010m11","However, the net debt of GBP 352 million is comfortably within our GBP 1 billion limit.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And the group's liquidity position remains very strong at GBP 2.",1781
18511,"2010m11","1 billion, meaning, we are well positioned for investment.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So in summary and to complete my review of the financial performance, we have seen good portfolio performance, driven by earnings improvements.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We have a continued focus on conservative balance sheet management, and we remain well positioned to manage against continuing uncertainty in the market and take advantage of investment opportunities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I'm now going to hand over to Cressida, who's going to update you on our Infrastructure business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thank you, Julia, and good morning.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i has grown and established a profitable Infrastructure business from small beginnings.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We started investing in infrastructure-type assets through our private equity business that set up Infrastructure as a separate business line in 2005, as the market increasingly began to view infrastructure as a distinct asset class in its own right.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Since then, we've used 3i's investment expertise and capital to make infrastructure investments and to see two external funds, which now have combined assets under management of approximately GBP 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This slide gives more detail on our two infrastructure investment vehicles.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i Infrastructure PLC, in which we have a 33% holding, is a listed investment company, with a market cap and net assets of just under GBP 1 billion.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Its overall objective is to provide shareholders with a total return, net of costs, of 12% per annum when fully invested, with 5% distributors of yield.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The company's focus is on core infrastructure, which we define as assets with stable contracted revenues or some sort of regulatory protection, principally in the transportation and utility space.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It also has exposure to social infrastructure assets and to the Indian infrastructure market, through a commitment of 3i India Infrastructure Fund.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i Infrastructure's portfolio provides a high degree of inflation linkage, strong income generation, and opportunities for capital growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The company last week announced a new investment in Eversholt Rail Group and now has an investment portfolio of 15 assets worth around GBP 800 million and remaining cash balances of GBP 138 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The 3i India Infrastructure Fund, in which both 3i Group and 3i Infrastructure have a GBP 250 million commitment, is a GBP 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","2 billion LP fund established to access the growing infrastructure market in India.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It focuses on the port, airport, road and power sectors.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And its objective is to deliver an 18% net returns to its investors.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Following the announcement of a new investment in GBK Energy on Monday, the fund is now over 50% invested in four assets, including two power generation developers, a port, and a road constructor and operator.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our two external funds have now established a very strong track record and a good reputation in the market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","With its focus on mature infrastructure assets in developed economies, 3i Infrastructure has built a robust cash-generative portfolio, which has delivered a 9.",1781
18511,"2010m11","5% annualized growth in returns since inception during a period of great market volatility.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Importantly, it has also delivered its 5% yield objective in every year since inception.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And our India funds, with its focus on early-stage infrastructure assets in one fastest-growing economies in the world, is now valued at 56% above cost and has delivered a gross ROI since inception of nearly 20% so far, in line with its long-term return objectives.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Many of our LPs have singled this fund out as one of their best performing investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Julia has just taken you through 3i's return model, and this slide shows how the total return to infrastructure is generated.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i does not invest in infrastructure assets directly, but through 3i Infrastructure and through the India Fund.",1781
18511,"2010m11","These two contribute to do gross portfolio return in the same way as any other asset, through the realized and unrealized value movements and through dividends and capital returns.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i also generates advisory and performance fees from 3i infrastructure and management fees and carry from the India Fund.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This income is partly offset by the carry payables of the investment team and by the cost of running the business line, which consist mostly of staff costs.",1781

18511,"2010m11","On the face, it doesn't look that impressive.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I guess looking forward, realizations will improve, but should we also assume that the earnings growth will moderate? I mean, what would you expect as a more ""normal"" level of earnings growth? Or is sort of 15% per year something you think is achievable? In terms of the health of the portfolio, I mean, the general trend actually is positive.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We're seeing month-by-month continued overall trends.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The provisions numbers are slightly skewed because you get an individual company that has got specific issues relating to that company that will go through the provision that will make a difference to that figure.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So you can't necessarily draw conclusions across the portfolio from those individual numbers.",1781
18511,"2010m11","One company in the growth portfolio that was a sizable chunk of that provision number, actually, could come back very strongly, so we could end up at the 31st of March actually in effect reversing out some of that provision.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But we have a set policy that if the company is performing in a particular way, we will make a provision.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But the key message is the underlying health of the portfolio is continuing to show steady improvement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Well, I think what we're looking to do overall is deliver 15% returns to shareholders.",1781
18511,"2010m11","That will come in a combination of forms, will come from the earnings growth on the portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We typically do see a step-up when we sell assets open above the carrying value, so that gives an additional boost to return; and of course, from the income streams from managing third-party assets, which clearly will start to rise as we incorporate the Debt Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I think if you look at this half year's performance, I mean, the way I try and look at this is to sort of x out multiple movement, both up and down, whether year and a half, half-year period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And so I think what they're all about in terms of the overall consistency with that delivery of that trend.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So to take your question on provisions and impairments, first, I mean, clearly, you're right.",1781
18511,"2010m11","If you compare the numbers to last year, then it doesn't look like a particularly good shift.",1781
18511,"2010m11","What it would say is clearly last year had almost the benefit of the previous year where we've had some very, very significant provisions and impairment.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So I'd say last year was unusually low.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this year, the provision level is 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","1% of opening portfolio value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","That's an unusual sort of amount.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In terms of the underlying movement sort of in there, it's a small number of assets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There's no particular themes that I can draw out for you that's spread across the business lines, that's spread across sectors and spread across geographies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The specific factors to particular investments and don't actually indicate any underlying trend for the overall portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And then in terms of cash for the period, I mean, clearly there are, as Michael has said, there was a number of transactions that are being well trailed in the market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Without trying to give you a specific number where we expect cash to be because we would like actually to be investing in the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So it's realistic to assume that there will be some significant realizations coming through.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But in terms of where net debt's going to be, I would hope that we would actually be putting in some decent amount of investment in the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Some of that will come down to timing.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Where we're talking about smaller numbers of large transactions, we can get quite different numbers coming over the year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So I would hope that we would have investment, but clearly this number of realizations going through.",1781
18511,"2010m11","If I talk about the first half in particular, one of the things I talked about is the conservative balance sheet management and trying to extend our maturities and manage those maturities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So one of the factors that you have in this period is the consequence of us refinancing in effect the convertible bond ahead of time.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So you remember we took advantage of the small window of opportunity in March to raise the GBP 350 million fixed rate bond that we have.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So you've got the interest cost of that coming in overlapping with the convertible bond in the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It's a consequence of actually our conservative balance sheet management.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The important thing is by next year, that overlap will have phased out.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And then I don't really want to go to the joys of IS39 accounting.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But one of the consequences of that in trying to manage the overlap I've talked about, we've been buying back our convertible bond in the market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The convertible bond has an amortization charge that comes through the total return statement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The consequence of buying it back early means that we've accelerated some of that amortization into the first half, so there's GBP 8 million of accelerated amortization sitting in those numbers.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The way I'm looking at is really looking through to next year, when all of these factors should have washed out, when we'll have a fixed interest cost of about GBP 50 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And that will be about half of our interest costs going forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Just with the OpEx point.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Actually, some of our costs are activity-related.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So as activity levels are building up in terms of investment and improvement in WIP, then I'm expecting to see some cost coming through there.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Effectively, what I'm saying to do is just don't double the number for the first half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There'll be a small increase on the first half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But overall, we're on a continuing downward trajectory.",1781
18511,"2010m11","That's the most significant transaction coming through.",1781
18511,"2010m11","[indiscernible] Firstly, provisions and impairments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","These have increased again.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I think over the last two halves, they were actually positive, if I remember correctly.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Can you just give us a bit more color on that? How many assets are involved? And then the other question was on cash.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I mean, there are quite a number of sales that you've announced over the last few months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","If you project the cash that you're expecting to come in, how much is actually due to come in and be completed? Where will that then leave net debt? Danny Garrod from Barclays Capital.",1781
18511,"2010m11","First, just following on from the set of provisions and impairment side, am I right in the detail of the text you do highlighted as health deterioration on the growth side of the portfolio, the percentage being down versus September versus March.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I wonder if you could give some specificity on what's going on there? And secondly, you mentioned about expectation of H2 OpEx being higher than H1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Could you give a bit of color what's flat of the H1 or what's expected in H2, given the H1 is strongly below the run rate, shall we say, of last year? Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everybody.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me start my financial update by taking you through the highlights of the six months to September.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Investment at GBP 327 million was still at a relatively modest level, although it was significantly up from last year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our portfolio has performed well, with an improvement in earnings used for evaluation purposes of 8% in the six months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is a key driver of the 8.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7% gross portfolio return in the six months, despite lower multiples used to value the portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The benefits of the tough decisions we've taken in our own business is reflected in our operating costs, which have continued to fall.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our total return on opening shareholders funds at 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","8% was an encouraging result.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And consequently, the board has an approved an interim dividend of 1.",1781
18511,"2010m11","2p per share, as we've taken the opportunity to reset our dividend at a higher level.",1781
18511,"2010m11","NAV per share grew by 9p in the period to GBP 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Importantly, as Michael said, this is a 15% increase on a year ago.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we have finished the period with liquidity of more than GBP 2 billion and net debt of only GBP 352 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me give you some more detail on the investment of GBP 327 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We have invested GBP 58 million in two new businesses: Trescal, which is a European calibration service provider; and Vedici, the fifth-largest acute healthcare company in France.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In this very competitive market, both experience and will provide opportunities to buy and build.",1781
18511,"2010m11","More than the third in investment was made expanding the investment in our existing portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We continue to provide acquisition funding as we see our portfolio companies able to do transactions which are not subject to the same high prices we see elsewhere.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we've also taken the opportunity in two cases to buy senior debt and pick at discounted values.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Realizations of GBP 293 million were achieved as an 11% uplift over opening book value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The most significant individual transaction was the sale by Inspectorate of its global Commodity Testing and Inspection division.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As a result, we received proceeds of GBP 121 million and retained a top 30 investment, which is valued at GBP 42 million, which is now called ESG and is focused on environmental and food testing.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Despite the prevalence of secondary transactions in the market, almost all of our realizations with the non-financial buyers.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Looking then at the breakdown of our total return.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Gross portfolio return is the return we generate directly from our portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The GBP 307 million represents an 8.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7% return on opening portfolio value for the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It is driven by period performance in the portfolio, giving rise to unrealized profits of GBP 196 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","All our core business lines generated an 8% return in the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We then get to net portfolio return by reflecting the income and costs associated with the Asset Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So the GBP 236 million represents the gross portfolio return diluted by carry payable and operating expenses and enhanced by carry receivable and fund fee income.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Finally, total return takes account of the effects of our balance sheet structure.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So the GBP 117 million of return is achieved after deducting our cost of finance as well as a net exchange loss of GBP 29 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So turning then to the valuation of our portfolio and its effect on our returns in the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","You will see from this slide that most of the return in this period comes from the highest-quality factors, uplifts to sale and portfolio earnings growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This builds on the momentum in the second half of last year and represents a very different picture from that of 12 months ago.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The uplift on assets, which are in the process of being sold, was GBP 66 million in the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It includes the sale to Caterpillar of MWM, which is a German-headquartered global business supplying alternative engines.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This transaction is expected is complete by the end of the year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So this slide gives you some more detail on the earnings and multiple movements that we've used in our valuations exercise.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I've said before, the most striking aspect is the improvement in the quality of value growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Looking at the first line in the table, earnings used for the valuations grew by 8% in the first half, accounting for GBP 273 million of growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This follows a 5% increase in the second half of last year and compared to a 13% decline in the comparative period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This growth reflects the tough actions that our portfolio companies have been taking in the face of the considerable economic uncertainty that Michael has talked about in his statement this morning.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Markets were volatile in the six months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And overall, the market month pulls in the sectors and geographies in which we are invested fell during the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Consequently, the multiples we used in the valuations declined by 5%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This compares to a 10% increase in the second half of last year and a 21% increase in the comparative period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As usual, we've provided you with further analysis regarding our valuations in the appendices to your presentation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Before talking about the balance sheet, let me make a few comments on other components of total return.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Fund fee income generated is marginally up on the same period last year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is principally due to the launch of the growth capital fund at the end of March.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I mentioned earlier, we have taken tough actions ourselves to improve cost efficiency.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Operating costs were down to GBP 89 million for the six-month period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I do expect cost to be marginally higher in the second half, although the year-on-year trajectory remains down.",1781
18511,"2010m11","A GBP 29 million exchange loss was incurred in the first six months due to the strengthening of sterling.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The earning hedging in operation in the six-month period was that affected by our core currency borrowings.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As we've noted in our statement this morning, the board has recently decided to extend the hedging policy to include the use of derivatives.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is a limited extension and will not exceed 30% of the corresponding portfolio value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Implementation will be phased throughout the second half of this year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Turning then to the balance sheet.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've continued to adopt a conservative approach to our balance sheet management.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We set ourselves a limit on net debt of GBP 1 billion.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We have also set an objective of reducing our gross debt and managing maturities so that over time, maturities in any one year will be no more than GBP 300 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Consistent with that strategy, gross debt has been reduced by GBP 354 million through a series of actions, significantly, the repayments of GBP 195 million of the convertible bond and GBP 89 million of commercial paper.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we've continued with this activity since September.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There was an increase in net debt as a result of net cash outflow in the period due to operating activity.",1781
18511,"2010m11","However, the net debt of GBP 352 million is comfortably within our GBP 1 billion limit.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And the group's liquidity position remains very strong at GBP 2.",1781
18511,"2010m11","1 billion, meaning, we are well positioned for investment.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So in summary and to complete my review of the financial performance, we have seen good portfolio performance, driven by earnings improvements.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We have a continued focus on conservative balance sheet management, and we remain well positioned to manage against continuing uncertainty in the market and take advantage of investment opportunities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I'm now going to hand over to Cressida, who's going to update you on our Infrastructure business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thanks, Cressida.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I'd now like to update you on our strategic progress and then talk about the outlook and our priorities for the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The four key elements of our strategy, as set out on this slide, are also described in detail on our IR website as well as in our annual report.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And today, I want to mainly focus on two aspects of this strategy, investing and growing the business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me start with investment.",1781
18511,"2010m11","High-quality new investment is important to future value growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But the environment for making good investments has been challenging.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Let me explain what I mean by challenging.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Volume of private equity activity across Europe has been very low.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The number of transactions for both growth and buyouts is a third the level than it was in 2007.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But the funds available for investment continue to be very high, with the consequence that most transactions in Europe have been very high prices so we have an overhang of capital in our industry.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now in this environment, we've taken a measured and highly selective approach to the market and focused only on making investments where we feel we can make a significant impact on the performance of a particular company.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Trescal is a very good example of such a situation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It's a classic mid-market buyout in terms of size and profile.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Trescal is a French-based International business, providing calibration services for a wide range of industrial companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It has revenue of EUR 110 million and operates 60 laboratories in 11 countries.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We were able to invest through our strong relationship with the management, our experience having made several successful investments in the sector and the involvement of [indiscernible] from our business leaders network.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The investment case is based on four components.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Firstly, Trescal is in a growing sector, as many of its customers are looking to outsource testing and measurement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Secondly, because capital investment is required in building a company like Trescal, there are significant barriers to entry.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Thirdly, through our active partnership analysis, we and management believe there's considerable opportunity for operational improvement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And finally, given its market position and a highly fragmented sector, there's a real opportunity for buy and build.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now increasing the level of investment is only one way to grow 3i's value.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In addition, we must also continue to take every opportunity to grow the value of our existing portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Earnings growth in our portfolio is being good.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And one of the ways that our portfolio companies have been delivering this is to find opportunities in developing markets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MWM is a very good example of this.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MWM is a GBP 360 million euro buyout from Deutsche AG in 2007.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And it's a leading manufacturer of engines that are used to produce power.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now a typical use for an MWM engine is generating power from landfill gas sites, so there's huge demand for these products in the developing world.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our investment case was based on growth and significant operational improvement.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And key to delivering this was the introduction of Peter Grosch, again from 3i's Business Leaders Network to lead a program of significant cultural change, alongside a number of 3i active partnership initiatives to improve MWM's strategic position and operational effectiveness.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Performance of the business has dramatically improved, and its market position has been strengthened.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this made it a really attractive acquisition target.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And last month, we announced that Caterpillar had agreed to purchase MWM for EUR 580 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now this sale which is subject to various regulatory approvals will deliver 2.",1781
18511,"2010m11","2x money multiple and proceeds of EUR 224 million for 3i Group, as well as an IRR of 25% for 3i and the investors in our Eurofund V.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In addition to making high-quality investments such as Trescal and MWM and doing everything we can to help these businesses grow their earnings and improve their strategic positioning, we've also been investing in 3i itself.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our Infrastructure business is a great example of this.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But another strategic investment is our Debt Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This started in 2005 with a small in-house team.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The team provides banking expertise to our deal teams and to our portfolio.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In addition, it invests in high-quality debt instruments in non-3i investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This team's been a major source of strength to 3i throughout the credit crisis and has added considerable value to our investment teams and our portfolio of companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Given this positive experience, we saw a real strategic opportunity to expand our debt investment and management activities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The acquisition of MIM from Mizuho was therefore a natural step.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MIM manages GBP 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7 billion of assets in eight funds of corporate, senior and subordinated debt.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The rationale for the deal was straightforward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MIM builds on 3i's existing debt management capabilities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","MIM also brings an experienced team of 28 people to 3i, including Jeremy Ghose.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Jeremy will join our leadership team and head up the Debt Management business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This move creates a platform to manage multiple funds and provides the potential to diversify into other debt products, as well as the capacity to grow using 3i's balance sheet.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Strategically, the Debt Management business is important because like infrastructure, it provides the opportunity for a good source of low volatility returns with a significant yield component.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This next slide shows you the shape of the business once the MIM acquisition is complete, which we expect to be at the end of January 2011.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our Private Equity business is clearly the largest, with assets under management of GBP 7.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In September, we announced the decision to combine our Buyout and Growth Capital businesses to form a single Private Equity business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The rationale for this change was to ensure that we had the right model for a changing market and is based on ensuring we continue to develop our business model to maintain a sustainable competitive advantage.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our Buyout and Growth Capital businesses have the same mid-market focus, targeting companies with an enterprise value in the range of EUR 100 million to EUR 1 billion.",1781
18511,"2010m11","They have the same investment and management processes, and our teams adopt the same approach to achieving influence through being active members of the portfolio company boards.",1781
18511,"2010m11","They share the same active partnership approach to driving value, both use the group's network and sector expertise and both draw on our Business Leaders Network members.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now another important driver of this decision was our view on what the next generation of private equity funds might look like.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our view was that there's an evolution towards more regionally-based funds and that most LPs are more focused on making geographic allocations than the distinction between majority and minority private equity investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've also been preparing for the next generation of leadership in our investment business, and I'll say more on that in a minute.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This change has been welcomed by professional advisors, management teams, our Business Leaders Network and our own people.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The feedback that we've had is it will make 3i easier to understand and easier to deal with.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this is critical in a highly competitive market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've been actively communicating with our LP investors in both our buyout and growth funds.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we are, of course, committed to managing these funds on the same basis through to the end of their investing periods.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now following these changes this autumn, we're in a six-month consultation period with our Eurofund V Advisory Board.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Those discussions are constructive and include the possibility of potentially extending the fund for one year beyond November 2011.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Notwithstanding the six-month consultation period, we expect matters to be resolved by the end of the calendar year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So the bottom line is the fund continues as normal.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've also recently promoted three people to the leadership team, Menno Antal, Alan Giddins and Cressida Hogg, who you already heard from.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Menno has been a senior partner in the Buyout business and will take over leadership of the buyout fund and have geographical responsibility for Northern Europe.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Alan Giddins, who is also a senior partner in Buyouts and has also led our business services sector across the whole company, will have, responsibility for the U.",1781
18511,"2010m11","and all our sector activities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We now have three strong platforms for growth, which can leverage our resources and expertise.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The growth of our Debt Management and Infrastructure businesses brings several benefits to 3i, not least in lowering potential volatility through generating increased revenue profits.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I want to give you a brief update on six of our largest investments.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There are some really common themes as to how they have generated growth and value in a recession.",1781
18511,"2010m11","These are international development, improved strategy and positioning, operational effectiveness and also following a buy and build strategy.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There are more details of these and other companies in your packs and on the IR website.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But let me introduce these companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","ACR is the pan-Asian reinsurer that we invested in, in 2006.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Today, it has premiums of USD $500 million and customers across 50 countries.",1781
18511,"2010m11","NORMA is a leading manufacturer of joining technology products and solutions.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It operates across 80 countries, and since we invested, has opened new plants in China, Thailand, Mexico, Russia and Serbia.",1781
18511,"2010m11","EBITDA has tripled during our investment period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Foster + Partners is one of the world's most innovative architectural practices, and since our investment has continued to expand internationally and has now delivered projects in 50 countries.",1781
18511,"2010m11","EBITDA has grown 68% since our investment in 2007.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Mémora is a leading funeral service provider in Spain and Portugal.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Through acquisitions, growth and operational improvement, EBITDA is up 21% from the time of our investment in 2008.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Mayborn may be well known to you through the its Tommee Tippee brand.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And this business has grown internationally from virtually nothing when we invested, to 55% of sales today.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And the last of these six companies is Quintiles, the global market leader in outsourced clinical trial.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've supported what was already an outstanding company to grow further in Asia and Europe.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But let me return to the common themes.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In five out of these six, we supported their international development.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In all of them, our sector knowledge and ability to identify great people from our Business Leaders Network has either helped the company directly or given 3i particular insight into the opportunities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In all of them, our active partnership initiative is generating operational improvements, improving their strategic positions and building robust growth through acquisitions that are enhancing returns.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Together, these companies have a combined value of GBP 724 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And more and more of our portfolio companies we're making these initiatives deliver value for us.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Today, we focus on the first two elements of our strategy, investing and growing 3i.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In order to achieve these, it's absolutely critical that we do all that we can to ensure that 3i's reputation not only remains good, but that we build on it.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our success internationally owes much to the strength of our brand.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As you heard from Cressida, 3i's brand has been central to developing a strong position in the infrastructure market.",1781
18511,"2010m11","3i's reputation as a responsible investor is a core part of our brand and we'll be placing an increased emphasis on corporate responsibility, not just to the group level but also in all our portfolio companies.",1781
18511,"2010m11","At our results presentation in May, I mentioned the One 3i approach that we've been driving through the business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The point of this was to increase our effectiveness, especially in terms of how we source opportunities, how we convert these opportunities into investments and then how we create value once invested.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This underpins all the other elements of our strategy.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And of course, the real test of whether this strategy delivers value will be our long-term financial performance and reputation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So let me turn to the outlook and our priorities for the second half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Predicting the macroeconomic outlook remains a challenge.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The important thing is that 3i is in a strong position to take advantage of either a sustained improvement or given our financial strength, to deal with further turbulence.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The outlook for our Private Equity business is improving.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Pricing will remain full.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I think that this will continue for another 12 to 18 months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But despite this, we can find good investments, as we've demonstrated with Trescal and Vedici.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As Cressida said, conditions in the infrastructure market in Europe and in India look favorable.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And as demonstrated by the two investments we've announced in the last week.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The outlook for the Debt Management business is also positive, with the opportunity to grow assets under management through new funds and further acquisitions.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The combination of the MIM team's track record and capabilities and 3i's brand and financial strength position us well to take advantage of these opportunities.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So overall, the outlook for 3i is good, and we've therefore taken the opportunity to increase our dividend by 20%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In the short term, our priorities are to continue to deliver good financial performance, to integrate MIM, and to increase momentum in our investment activity.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So in conclusion, our key themes for today are: we've increased the momentum throughout the business; our portfolio has also delivered a good performance; we've made good progress in terms of strategic development; and we now have three strong platforms for growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I also said at the beginning, we've moved from planning and organizing growth to delivering growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Julia, Cressida and I would now be happy to take any questions that you've got.",1781
18511,"2010m11","[Operator Instructions] Is there anything else due to come through in the next few weeks? Thanks, Patrick.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Half Yearly Results Presentation.",1781
18511,"2010m11","This is our agenda for today.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I'm going to give a short introduction, and then Julia will present a financial review of the first half year.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Cressida Hogg, who's our managing partner of the Infrastructure business, will then give you an overview of this important part of 3i's investment activity.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And finally, I'll review our strategic progress and cover the outlook and priorities for the next six months.",1781
18511,"2010m11","As I said in the statement this morning, we've increased momentum throughout the business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Our portfolio has delivered a good performance, achieving a gross portfolio return of 8.",1781
18511,"2010m11","7% for the six months until the 30th of September.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Total return was lower at 3.",1781
18511,"2010m11","8%, although NAV growth over the last 12 months is over 15%.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've made good progress in terms of strategic development, and we now have three strong platforms for growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In my last few presentations to you, I've talked about planning and organizing for growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","We've now moved into the delivery phase.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I'll give you more detail on this later.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But before that, Julia will review our financial performance.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Philip Middleton from Merrill.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Just kind of on that note of leakage between net portfolio return and ultimate return.",1781
18511,"2010m11","The net interest income was higher this half.",1781
18511,"2010m11","In the statement, you talk about some one-offs due to repurchase of bits and pieces of debt.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Presumably those will improve the gross interest expense in the future.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Could you talk a little bit about the trajectory there please? And just going back on the cash, if we take into account transactions such as MWM, how much cash is still to come through on deals that haven't completed yet? Chris Brown from JPMorgan.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Michael, you were talking about pricing remaining full.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Can you talk about the prospects for upselling some assets into that strength in the second half? I mean, obviously, there have been a few press stories about one or two of your assets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So the MWM transaction is expected to bring in about GBP 180 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So as Michael said on his slide, that's GBP 224 million.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I think we're learning to live with an environment where everything a financial company does is immediately reported in the press.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So you have a pretty good view on the pipeline of potential realizations that are coming forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","What I can say is when we look at the assets that have been talked about, a number of our big industrial companies, particularly in Continental Europe, we expect to achieve extremely attractive prices for these assets because they are really high quality businesses.",1781
18511,"2010m11","One of the businesses that's being talked about that I referred to, NORMA, is just a sensational business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","That has a potential to be a very, very strong IPO candidate, not just a potential trade sale.",1781
18511,"2010m11","It's a very attractive business.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And the reason it's attractive is because it's got great exposure to developing markets.",1781
18511,"2010m11","One of the things that we've been pushing across all of our industrial portfolio is where they haven't already got strong market access in India, China or South America, really helping them to move that forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And that's what makes these assets very attractive.",1781
18511,"2010m11","I mean, one of the themes that we've been focused on is how do we access that developing market growth.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And I think there are two ways to do that.",1781
18511,"2010m11","One is to invest directly in Asian companies, which clearly we're doing as in GBK, but the other is to make sure our great European businesses are also accessing that growth, and therefore we can benefit in that way as well.",1781
18511,"2010m11","[indiscernible] Michael, I understand what you're saying about pricing.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But even allowing for that, the level of investment in growth capital seems particularly low over the period.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Were there any reasons for that? And how do you see that going forward? Charles, one of the things that we've always seen in this business going through economic cycles is that the demand for growth capital picks up as you start to come out of the downturn.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So through the bottom of the market you don't actually see a lot of demand, and then you see demand pick up.",1781
18511,"2010m11","What's been unusual this time as we've started to see economic recovery, there's been a real reticence among businesses to actually invest, whether it's in a fixed plant and equipment, going out and buying new businesses.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Now it's hard to say whether that trend is going to continue.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But it certainly surprised us that we haven't seen a stronger growth capital pickup, given where we are in the economic cycle.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And it maybe that the way that the banks have behaved has resulted in people being extremely nervous about entering into any new commitments going forward.",1781
18511,"2010m11","There is certainly an element of that.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But I would have to say, I just think that this position, this growth in demand for growth capital has simply been deferred.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And certainly, if we look at the work in progress that we're seeing and we're tracking this on a daily basis, we are seeing the early stage work in progress around growth capital is starting to pick up.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But I think it's too early to say whether that is an evidence of a trend.",1781
18511,"2010m11","But I think it's being deferred in the cycle and certainly happening later than we saw in previous cycles.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Are there any further questions? Well, if there aren't, as Patrick said, we wanted to conclude by 10:02.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And amazingly, we've done exactly that.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So thank you all very much for coming.",1781
18511,"2010m11","Julia, Cressida and I and Patrick are available all day for any other questions that you've got.",1781
18511,"2010m11","And we look forward to seeing you over the next six months in our various one-on-one meetings.",1781
18511,"2010m11","So thank you, all, for coming.",1781
18511,"2011m11","So to be clear, my comments around using capital profit was to acknowledge that if you look at our cash flow in any 1 year at the moment, then clearly, there's an element of funding dividend out of capital cash flows.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of the reserves that we will use to pay the dividend, for now, until the new investment trust rules come into operations, then we will be using our revenue reserve.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There is ample in the revenue reserve, taking into account of the dividend that we've announced today and assuming no further revenue profits generated and we have at least 2 years covered in our revenue reserve, but we are absolutely expecting the changes to come through buy the end -- by the next financial give growth effectively in terms of the flexibility our reserves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Thank you, Julia, and good morning, everyone.",2322
18511,"2011m11","My name is Menno Antal, I'm Dutch.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm an engineer by education and complemented by an MBA from IMV.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Before joining 3i, I worked for 10 years at Heineken in different international, operational, commercial and general management roles.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I joined 3i in 2012 to help build the Benelux office in Amsterdam, for which I became a Managing Director in 2003.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In 2009, I took over responsibility for Germany, followed by the Nordic region in 2010.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I also became part of the leadership team in 2010.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What I would like to do in this presentation is to provide a brief update on the European Private Equity markets and to explain our strategy within these markets, particularly against a market backdrop that continues to present challenges.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Then to take you through the recent investment activities to demonstrate actually why I believe we will be successful in delivering good returns in the medium term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Through this presentation, I'd also like to give you a clear understanding of the changes other Private Equity business as announced by Michael earlier.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me begin when the European Private Equity markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The investment activities have come up significantly since '07 and '08.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Even if the large cap markets has suffered most, the midmarket has also been impacted, and investment levels are now comparable to the years of 2003 and 2004.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In 2010 and the first half of 2011, we saw an upward trend in activity levels.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, since the beginning of August, the euro prices has had a significant impact on the market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The third quarter to the end of September is showing a 41% decline in investment activity on the previous quarter.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's our expectation that these conditions will prevail well into 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, there are clear regional differences across the European market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have an excellent investment track record over the past 10 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In Germany, the Benelux, France and the Nordic region, 3i is very well-positioned in these markets and we continue to see attractive investment opportunities given the quality of the companies that we're seeing, the strength of the management teams and our ability to help these businesses achieve their international potential.",2322
18511,"2011m11",", we obviously have a very strong position.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In the short term, we expect the current economic conditions to continue in the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11",", and combined with the intense competition we are seeing for good quality assets means that we already remain highly selective.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That said, I'm confident that we will find attractive opportunities in this market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The Spanish and Italian markets show even greater challenges.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Making new investments in these markets does not look attractive in the near term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, we are have a very good market position and says high-quality team to create value from the existing market portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Turning to our strategy, on the right side of the slides, I've set out our key competitive advantages, and on the left, the deal criteria, which are based on these advantages.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our target market is investments with an enterprise value of up to EUR 500 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We consider this to be the midmarket where local relationships are of high importance, and where our companies are focused on international growth which plays to our strengths.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our key competitive advantage is the global presence that we have, with local offices that are deeply rooted in their respective business communities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I believe this is unique in the European midmarket, particularly when combined with our presence and experience of markets such as India, China and most recently, Brazil.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our global network help us to assess the international growth opportunity of a given investment, and subsequently, determine a strategy to ensure its execution.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Another key advantage is our sector knowledge, and the people and network we've built around the sectors.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This not only makes us proactive in our investment approach, but also the long-term track records that we have built in these sectors provides the opportunity to work with best-in-class chairman and operators giving us real credibility with management teams when we are pursuing a deal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As we would expect and entirely consistent with the Private Equity investment model, we focus on bringing operational improvements to each of our investments through our Active Partnership program, which is crucial to driving value, particularly in this current environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In the case of casino but we'll give you a clear sense of what I mean.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But first, let me take you through our recent investment activity.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have made 13 new investments since the rights issue in 2009, to which we have rigorously applied the investment disciplines that I've just described.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In your presentation packs you will find an overview of each of these investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Performance is very promising, with 85% of these companies performing in line or ahead of plan, and we have clear visibility of those companies that are not performing to plan.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Turning to the 3 most recent buyouts set out on this slide, let me provide some greater detail to demonstrate how we apply our investment criteria to each new investment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","SMT is a European U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","testing and inspections business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We know this sector well, and our cross Atlantic consolidation strategy place our strengths year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As part of the strategy, we see a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities in both Europe and the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Trading performance is strong, with current organic growth of 25%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This now translates into a purchase price of less than 8x 2011 EBITDA, down from 9.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Another recent investment is Axxiom, a Dutch discount retailer, we were able to acquire in an off market transaction from the founders.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We regard the business as noncyclical and highly defensive, given its discount offering.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The company has delivered 21% growth on average each of the past 5 years, and we see a continuation of that growth again this year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now you can see that the international book is not picked.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we have indeed not built our base business options on an international rollout.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, despite the strong growth we are seeing in Axxiom's domestic market will, we intend to pursue a strategy to internationalize the business to accelerate growth and maximize the potential of this investment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let now turn to Highlight into more detail.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Highlight is a classic 3i buyout.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This is a EUR 190 million acquisition of a non-core, German subsidiary of a U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","company through our German and U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We run this deal on the back of our track records in the automotive and engineering sector based on what we achieved with the investment such as MWM, Eva and NORMA, all investments which have delivered fabulous returns over the last 12 to 18 months.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Highlight is a leading global supplier of fuel efficiency and emissions reductions components, with annual sales of around EUR 300 million and a very positive sales outlook.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The majority of its sales for the next 4 years have already been contracted.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Management was attracted to 3i's track record in the automotive industry, our ability to further internationalize businesses, along with our Active Partnership approach to drive further efficiencies from across the business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We regard this as one of the most exciting segments of the automotive industry.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Highlight is the innovation leader, and we see real potential to grow the business internationally, particularly in China.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Since the investment, we've been able to strengthen management, bringing the former chairman of NORMA and former executives from Siemens and GE to the company.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now based on current performance, we completed a deal at 5.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4x 2011 EBITDA, which makes it very attractively priced.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Many of you will be familiar with the following, which sets out are Private Equity track record over the last 10 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The total equity value at exit the state of net realized losses, I believe that our recent investment -- apologies for that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I therefore believe that this is a good proxy for the track record of the Private Equity business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Despite the impact of performance of  recent advantages.",2322
18511,"2011m11","An enormous amount of work has been done to mitigate portfolio risk.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have reinforced our investment procedures, financial risk and government processes to apply realistic investment parameters that recognize current operating environment in which we are investing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've reduced a leverage across the buyer portfolio from around 6x EBITDA to 4.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4x, with over 85% of the portfolio not having any maturities due before 2014.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The further changes that we are bringing to our business today built on the initiatives we have implemented under Michael's leadership.",2322
18511,"2011m11","These changes will strengthen our position for both today's and tomorrow's markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In summary, with the changes that we have made to the team over the past year, including today, we have in place a high-quality team, which is determined to succeed and to deliver really good returns.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I believe our recent investments demonstrate that even in the current markets, we are able to find exciting investment opportunities, with significant growth strategies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I would now like to hand back to Michael.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The chart you put on page report looking at the breakdown of returns between most of the expansion growth, et cetera, do you have sort of aggregates, money market IRR for those investments? I mean we certainly have flagged today that we expect the environment for realizations over the next 6 to 12 months to be particularly challenging.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As Menno outline, the activity level, both realizations and new investments in Private Equity is back at the 2003, 2004 level.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You could even see that actually falling back further than that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It really does depend on how the Eurozone crisis impacts on the banking market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Right now, the banks are closed for business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So that will have an impact, both on the ability to fund new investments and also on other people's ability to buy investments in our portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we have had, in the last 6 months, 1 process where we backed out a bit because the funding climate have got more challenging.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as I said in my statement, we were very fortunate we got most of the realizations of this period in the early part of the period when the markets were pretty much functional.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we are anticipating a slower period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And but we, given the sheer scale of our portfolio, there will always be some level of churn, and we do have some visibility on some realizations coming through.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But we are flagging it's going to be in a difficult environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And on the other side of that means that we're going to be highly selective in investment, making sure we're only paying the right value of businesses and making sure that, that value reflects the uncertainties in the market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Well the board's considered whether it's appropriate to conduct buybacks in the current market, and felt that given the uncertainties around refinancing and our need to continue to rollover some parts of our gross borrowings, it was just too uncertain of an environment to embark on that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What we also need to do is to make sure that we continue to meet our fiduciary responsibilities in respect of the funds that we manage.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We raise these funds and we charge fees on the basis that we will invest in assets over a given timeframe.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And it's very important that we continue to do that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And clearly, 3i has investment in those assets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's important to meet that because we intend to continue to raise funds going forward.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So while mathematically, if the share traders are discount to net assets, it's on a saleable logic of buying the shares on that basis would boost the NAV per share.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's not necessarily in the long-term interest of shareholders for us to do that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And that's what the board's taken into account in coming out with a decision today that in the current time, we would not undertake buybacks.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now that's not to say that, that will be the position forever.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We don't have a principled objection to buy that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We actually see buybacks as appropriate as an appropriate form of the cycle.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But given the risks in the macro environment today, we are not going to be doing that in the near term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I gave you the rate of the top 5.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just a few questions, some are quite short.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just wondered what pro forma hearing is MWM proceeds in terms of being any big investments to offset that? Monica Tepes from Westhouse Securities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Two questions please first of all, your outlook on realizations and new investments and the short to medium term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I don't know if you had many companies that maybe or in your past negotiation of selling and given market conditions at all can you start and really what you're expecting in terms of set investors can expect? Let me answer the question on fundraising for us.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The fund that we are out on the road with the moment is in our infrastructure find.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That's a successive vehicle to the first fund which has been very successful.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As I said, we expect that, that will be closed at some point during 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The Debt Management business, we would hope would be able to launch a number of different products.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Debt Management fundraising has been very, very challenging for 3 or 4 years really since the start of the financial crisis, though we are seeing now desire for yield, and our Debt Management business can certainly provide that in investing in good corporate credit in a relatively lowly or even unlevered way.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So there's a demand for that product.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of Private Equity fund raising, I mentioned in my statement, we plan we've come to the end of our, virtually at the end of our Europe 4 and 5 investment period, we won't be able to go out on the road and raised a new Private Equity fund though until we finish investing our Growth Capital Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Because what we said is our next European Private Equity or developed markets Private Equity fund will be a combined growth environment fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So as soon as we finish investing for us to get towards the end of the investment period in growth capital which is the end of 2012, we will then look to raise another Private Equity fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of what the market environment is, there are 2 aspects to that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","One is the fundraising environment which I think is tough as I've ever known it.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I think quite a lot of people or quite a lot of limited partners, the investors in funds, are taking a very long time to consider new propositions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There is a record number of funds, both from North America and Europe on the road at the moment and fundraising are taking an incredible length of time between 20 months and 24 months on the road for a typical fundraiser.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So extraordinary length of time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as you saw from Menno's chart earlier, relatively small amount of capital is actually being raised in new funds.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So this is a tough environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","How does that impact on us? Well actually, it plays to 3i's advantage to a certain extent because we are one of the few players in our industry with the benefit of permanent capital not just at the 3i Group level, but through 3i Infrastructure Plc as well.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we certainly intend to be in the market, making good investments, notwithstanding all of the things I've said about how cautious we are.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But it does mean that we can be in the market effectively doing good deals and we're not going to be on the road in the next 12 months.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If you could put your hand up and wait for the microphone because the questions are being webcast as well.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Gentlemen? Good morning, everyone and welcome again to my job is very simple and that's just simply to let you know that the fire alarm goes for any reason, you need to move out from the back please.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And also, if you could, please turn your mobiles and any other devices off that might interfere with the microphones because this morning's presentation is being webcast.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So without further ado, I'd like to introduce Chief Executive Michael Queen.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I got a couple of questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The first 1 is on earnings and I'm surprised that the magnitude of the GBP 52 million negative due to weaker earnings, you're obviously using 23% of the portfolio, dividing that on a forward earnings basis.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I was wondering if you could just give us a bit more color whether that's sector-specific, geographic-specific and do you expect the trend to deteriorate over the next 6 months.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The other question is just on the also the breakdown.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You see a growth and buyout with know with all being lumped together as Private Equity.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But can you just give us a bit of a feel for how the growth portfolio performed and how the buyer portfolio performed overall? The final question whether it was about dividend reserve, our revenue reserves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just want to ask everybody what they can say about that and what extent did be able to finance the dividend going forward from revenues to imply you be happy to use of the capital IQs wonder technically what the reserve position was? Well, good morning, everyone.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me take you through the agenda for today's briefing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm going to start by giving an overview of the group performance, as well as more detail on the Private Equity changes that we've announced this morning and the result of the board's dividend policy review.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Julia will follow with a detailed financial results.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Then I'll ask Menno Antal to give a bit more color on how the Private Equity business line is performing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Finally, I'll return to say a few words on the outlook before we open the floor to questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There's no doubt that the last 6 months have presented an extremely difficult operating environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","For financial markets, it's been appeared of considerable uncertainty and fears regarding the future of the Eurozone have severely damaged business confidence in many of our markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i has not been immune to this turmoil, and as you'll see in more detail, as Julia takes you through the financials, our half year performance has been significantly affected by the macroeconomic environment, particularly the impact of falling stock markets on multiples.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We can take some comfort in the underlying performance of our investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On a value-weighted basis, our portfolio earnings have increased 8% in the 6 months, with our more valuable investments tending to be the better performers throughout the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, as I've raised repeatedly through these presentations, our performance has continued to be impacted by the high prices paid and high leverage of assets invested in, in 2007 and 2008.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On the macroeconomic level, parallels can be drawn between what we're going through now and the first stage of the financial crisis in 2008.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, from a 3i Group perspective, there's a marked contrast between then and now.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The steps we've taken to strengthen our balance sheet were a precaution against exactly the kind of market conditions we're seeing today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also significantly reduced the leverage at the portfolio level.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As an example, the average debt multiple in our buyer portfolio now stands at 4.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4x, down from almost 6x, which gives greater headroom to cope with any temporary fluctuations in performance.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've reduced net debt at the 3i Group level too.",2322
18511,"2011m11","From a peak of GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","9 billion  in 2009 to just over GBP 0.",2322
18511,"2011m11","5 billion  today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Giving us a stronger position as we enter an increasingly uncertain period for realizations in refinancings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The quality of our asset management and investment capabilities has also been strengthened as evidenced by the performance of recent new investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The teams are very focused on maintaining their investment discipline and managing the portfolio to maximize value.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Another area where we've changed 3i is the cost base.",2322
18511,"2011m11","By adjusting our operational and financial structure and maintaining a focus on our core competencies, we've reduced operating expenses by 1/3 over the past 3 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Last year, we announced the combination of our European growth and buyout teams to form a single European Private Equity team.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As we reach the end of the Eurofund V investment period, we are now further reshaping this combined business to reflect the current market condition and the likely new investment environment over the next few years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In addition, we're integrating our U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","team to create a developed market private equity team.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This will allow operating efficiencies to be achieved, which in turn, enables a reduction of operating expenses by at least GBP 15 million a year from financial year 2012, '13.",2322
18511,"2011m11","These steps reflect the natural progression of our Private Equity business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The team will be well-positioned to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities as they arise and will have the full support of the 3i balance sheet.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In Developing Markets Private Equity, we strengthened our China team with the appointment of Paul Hsu.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also received an allocation to invest in local currency from the Chinese government.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And in Brazil, we've established an advisory board to support the local team in São Paulo.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The changes in the Private Equity business also require some changes to the leadership team and a realignment of leadership roles.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As we've already announced, Simon Burrows has joined as Chief Investment Officer, while his predecessor, Ian Nolan, is leaving 3i.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Meno Antal and Alan Giddins will jointly lead our Develop Market Private Equity business, covering Europe and the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11",", and it is will take over responsibility for developing markets in addition to his current responsibility for the Growth Capital Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Bob Stefanowski will step down from leadership team to focus on 2 of our larger portfolio companies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In our Infrastructure and Debt Management business lines, performance has been robust, and we're pursuing a number of initiatives.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The European infrastructure assets have performed well, and during the period, 3i Infrastructure's consortium was announced as a preferred bidder on the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","'s Telmslink rail project.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In India, we've launched the second Indian infrastructure fund, which we expect to complete during 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In Debt Management, the CLO funds are performing ahead of our original business plan, generating good advisory and performance fees.",2322
18511,"2011m11","During this period, we've launched a new credit opportunities fund, initially funded by 3i, which will aim to take advantage of the dislocation that we see in credit markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I now want to turn towards our current priorities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i's first priority is to maximize the value of our existing investments by supporting them through current economic conditions so that they're well-positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities that will follow.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We're also focused on maintaining investment discipline across our business lines.",2322
18511,"2011m11","All the deals we do must be reviewed in the light of constantly changing economic conditions, and we need to ensure that we pay the right price at the right time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's also vitally important that we continue with the conservative balance sheet strategy we followed since 2009.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Doing so will give us greater security to all our stakeholders in this uncertain environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","A key part of our strategy is to grow the business in a measured way.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Some good examples of this are the second Indian Infrastructure fund raising and the credit opportunities fund that I've already mentioned.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Together, these priorities feed into the delivery of our strategic model, and allow us to provide shareholders with more stable and consistent returns over the economic cycle.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now having introduced our model for returns in May and completed our review of the European Private Equity business, the board has now decided the appropriate proportion of those returns that should take the form of dividend.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm pleased to announce that subject to shareholder approval, we're raising the full year dividend to 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","1p per share, and this is an increase of 125% on the previous year in which we're declaring an interim dividend of 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","From this higher base, we expect to grow the dividend progressively in line with the performance of the business and its balance sheet strength.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The board has also considered undertaking share buybacks.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And while accepting the principle of buybacks has concluded that such purchases are not appropriate at the current time, particularly given the extreme uncertainty in financial markets and low levels of business and consumer confidence.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And now before I pass to Julia, let me give you the key metrics for the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As I've said, our gross return has been primarily driven by market conditions, most notably the decline in multiples used for valuation purposes.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Although as a whole, our investments have displayed resilient underlying performance.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The general softening of market conditions has led to a negative gross investment return of 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","At the cost and financing, this results in a negative total return of 15.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Despite the tough environment, we achieved a good level of realizations at GBP 532 million, although most of these were in the first half of this 6-month period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Investment during this period was GBP 448 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our gross debt currently stands at GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7 billion and taking into account our cash balances, we have net debt of GBP 531 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our liquidity, which includes cash and undrawn facilities, is GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Julia will now take you through these numbers, along with the other financials in more detail.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The chart on Page 34 I think it was in Menno's part of the presentation, showed where the value had come from the exited investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wondered if you had the money multiple for those investments in the IRR? So we've announced the investment in ATANCO, which wasn't invested in the 30th of September so my pro forma net debt is about GBP 100 million better than we numbered 30th of September.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I think it's comparable to kind of the 10-year track record IRRs that you referred to that's in the back of that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let's start with the provisions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I think the provisions are, they're not exceptional one way or the other.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's about where we would expect to see.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Clearly, if we see a full meltdown of the Eurozone, that will put significant stress on all companies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So under the environment, we would actually, we would expect to see provisions increasing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Absent that and let's assume governments get their act together and we do see some form stabilization, I wouldn't, in the current environment expect to see a significant increase in the level of provisioning that we're seeing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There will always be some provisioning, but I don't think it's going to be a dramatic increase on what we've got we got at the moment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i Infrastructure I think is a great performing business, it fundamentally does what it says on the tenet that provides very, very stable, secure return to the high yield component.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's a key part of our infrastructure strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What we've said in all of our business lines is we will have a mix of our own balance sheet capital and third-party capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the way in which we do that in, say, Private Equity, is we raise funds with limited partners.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The way we do that in Infrastructure is we have a listed permanent capital vehicle that we hold a stake in.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it's a fundamental part of our strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we have absolutely no intention of selling that stake or distributing it in.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now the shareholder concerns that race that, we haven't had the opportunity to speak to them because they didn't raise it with us before going public and we were in a close period, so we haven't been able to go about and really understand what their thinking was.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But certainly, as part of this roadshow, we will be having that discussion.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But we got no intention of selling our stake.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Well, if there are no further questions, thank you very much for coming along today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If you do think of any other questions during the course of the day, Julia and Menno and I will be very happy to answer them.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But thank you very much for coming.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And in terms of your cost question, fundamentally, we are a people business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So if we're looking at 10% cost reduction next year, that really flows through a 10% headcount fall.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So most of the costs are there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Why can we deliver that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Well fundamentally, over time, the sheer volume of our portfolio has been solid.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's a more concentrated portfolio and even 2 or 3 years ago, and that creates the opportunity for managing things in a slightly more efficient way.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We're continually looking at the way that we how our processes work, not just in terms of investment processes, but all our back office processes.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we're able to the continually improve systems.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it's a combination of things continually looking at all aspects of the business, in other words, doing to ourselves what we do see each of our portfolio companies in terms of driving efficiency of the business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So if I pick up your question first of all on the use of forecast earnings, yes, you're right.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That is a big factor in resulting in a contraction for the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as you said it's 23% of the companies are on a basis at this time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There's actually quite a spread of companies, to the extent this trends there's a number of U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","companies that are in there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So that's consistent with what we've talked about in the macro environment that we've seen.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If we hadn't included those forecast earnings, so if it was sort of consistent with the way that the companies are valued in quoted markets, then we would've seen an overall increase in the earnings about the portfolio between 3% and 4%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it is part of that conservatism that we built into our strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean to the extent of what do you expect that to do over the next 6 months, it's quite difficult to predict.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean clearly when we're doing our valuations, we did those in September.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We were taking account of as much management information that we had at that time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The march process will be have the benefits, including final accounts and the budgets for the following year so we will see where that ends up.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As Michael has said, we're operating in pretty tough economic conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So I would expect to see the same at least a similar forecast to earnings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","From taking questions from you.",2322
18511,"2011m11","First, I wonder if you provide a bit more color on the 10% cost reduction that you've outlined for next year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I think you sort of said that that's combining the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","developed markets, the division of the European ones can you give any more color around headcount reductions, relocations, office closures that is behind that GBP 15 million figure.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Second, the proved disclosure on the divisional basis with the net portfolio return I was a little surprised to see that Debt Management and infrastructure are sort of breakeven on loss making  there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You have a sort of get achieve that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The sort of size and the proportion of third-party funding that you would like to the returns will improve we're strictly you could receive that and third question is on the provisions element to the unrealized losses still very low there not really tick up despite the as you're aiding economic environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Is your expectation that we will see that sort of increase a little bit over the next 6 months or so in that particular element? Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As Michael has said, our returns for the 6 months of 30 September reflect the market conditions and appeared a considerable political, economic and financial uncertainty and volatility.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We are not immune to that seeing its effect in evaluation of our portfolio and our pension fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, our balance sheet means that we are able to withstand these headwinds from a position of strength.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This slide shows you the key elements of our returns.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The gross portfolio return reflects our returns directed by our direct investments in our portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net portfolio return reflects the financial impact of running our asset management business and finally, total return includes the financial effects of our balance sheet.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I will take you through each of these components in more detail in the next few slides, and as I do so, is a new disclosure regarding the performance of our business lines.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Having confirmed our model for returns in May, we're now reporting net portfolio return by business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In addition, I'll also provide you some detail on our valuations in the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our Private Equity business will always be the most significant component of our gross portfolio return as our business model assumes we'll allocate a much more significant proportion of our own capital to Private Equity than either Infrastructure or Debt Management.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The Private Equity returns include GBP 25 million of realized profits on gross proceeds of GBP 523 million, which would lower uplifts than normal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, this is due to the timing with the significant proportion of the value being reflected in uplifts of sale as of 31 March 2011.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The top 5 disposals were all at very good money multiples, ranging from 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The net GBP 414 million of unrealized write-downs reflect a deterioration in market multiples and some contraction in the earnings that we used on valuations.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And I'll come back to talk about this in more detail shortly.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The gross portfolio return in our Infrastructure business principally comprises the quoted movement and dividend income from our 35% stake in 3i Infrastructure Plc.",2322
18511,"2011m11",", offset by unrealized volume movements on investments in our Indian infrastructure fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Though our infrastructure share price has performed very well in the last 6 months, increasing by 3% to 121p at the 30th of September and offsetting some currency-led value declines in the Indian portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We increased our investments in Infrastructure Plc by GBP 33 million, exercising the warrants that we received when the company was first listed.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As expected, Debt Management has minimal effect at a gross portfolio return level, as we've invested only 1% of the capital at work in this business we'd expect us to grow unimportant as we invest in new funds such as the recently announced credit opportunities fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Turning then to the valuation of the portfolio, which gives rise to the GBP 441 million negative movements in the period, clearly, market conditions have deteriorated significantly and rapidly since I spoke to you in May.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And our portfolio is not immune to the effects of that, directly in terms of multiples, but also in some cases, in performance.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm going to comment on earnings and multiples in more detail shortly, so I'm just going to use this slide to talk about a couple of the other components.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Impairments of GBP 66 million relate to a number of asset and are a function of the earnings and multiple movements that I'm going to describe.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Provisions are low at GBP 43 million, the uplift to imminent sales relates to the disposal of MWM.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You may recall that we announced this disposal last year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm pleased to say that we have received proceeds of GBP 197 million at the start of November.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Finally, the movements on the quoted portfolio, which now accounts to 15% of the total, relates to our residual holding in NORMA which is a business that IPO in April as well as our 3i Infrastructure Plc shares and the Downing Power.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As expected, stock market declines in the period flow-through to the multiples that we used to value the portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The overall fold was 8%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On the face of it, this is lower than headline falls in say, the 4,100 13% however, it is in line with the movement in the underlying sectors and the geographies in which we have invested.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You can see here the portfolio diversification.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So for example, we have limited exposure in European financials, which had a significant impact on total market movements and our value exposure to consumer is much more heavily weighted to Asia.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The weighted average EBITDA multiple fell to 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","8x at the 31st of March.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We talk about earnings growth in 2 ways.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Firstly, in explaining the movements and earnings that we use for valuation purposes; and secondly, for considering the performance of the portfolio as a whole.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Looking first at the earnings that we use for valuation purposes, which results in a negative GBP 52 million unrealized value movement, 64% of the portfolio is valued on an earnings basis, and we calculate the movement on those companies that were valued in this way at the start and at the end of the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our valuation policy is to use the last 12 months management's accounts up to the preceding quarter, so in this case, to the 30th of June.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But if it is apparent that the current year forecast, in other words to the 31st of December, is showing reduced earnings, then we anticipate that decline and use those forecasts.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The number of companies in this position has increased in this period to 23% reflecting the market conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as a result, the earnings used for valuation purposes showed a contraction of 1%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Looking at earnings as a whole, in aggregate, the earnings in our Private Equity portfolio grew by 1% in the 6 months, but the weighted average growth in earnings was 8%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And it's in that context that we believe the portfolio performance has been solid despite the tough economic conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And this slide shows you some new disclosure about earnings performance of the Private Equity portfolio, breaking down the last 12 months earnings performance by value and number of companies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This slide then shows you the effects of those valuations on the total portfolio value.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We began the period with a portfolio of GBP 3.",2322
18511,"2011m11","9 billion investments of GBP 448 million was measured and Menno will talk in more detail about some of the new investments in Private Equity.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Taking account of unrealized losses, the investment and FX, the portfolio value at the end of the period was reduced to GBP 3.",2322
18511,"2011m11","For the first time we're providing a breakdown of our net portfolio return by business line.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As you will recall, we set our 50% targets for each of Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management on our bridge over 5 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We believe providing this framework allows for a more detailed discussion about the drivers of performance, how we allocate our capital and how new strategic initiatives are assessed.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So taking each business in turn, Private Equities performance is driven by its gross portfolio return, but the cross cycle target is 20%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We are a significant balance sheet investor here, 82% of our portfolio and 64% of the Private Equity assets under management.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And so, we expect there to be a dilution from gross to net returns.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Therefore, it appeared where market conditions have had a marked effect on the gross portfolio returns, the business will not achieve its 15% target.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Its return is a negative 11%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Fee income in the period is in line with expectations and reflects these from Eurofund 4 and 5 as well as the Growth Capital Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net carry is a positive as it reflects the reversal of previous accruals following the reduction in portfolio valuing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Over time, we expect net carry to be at cost as we carry on total investments but received carry only on the third party money that we manage.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The cost of GBP 74 million  include the new Brazil team and our flat year-on-year including this additional resource.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In Infrastructure, we have said we expect to be managing 75% third party money and 25% of our own capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As of the 30th of September, this ratio was 69:31, reflecting our additional investment of GBP 33 million in the period for 3i Infrastructure Plc.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As a result, we expect lower gross returns for this business to be enhanced by fees and carry more than covering costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We still expect this to be the case in the longer term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Today, 3i capital represents only 1% of the assets under management in Debt Management, although our aim is to invest 10% capital in this business line.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Consequently, we expect fee income to be the most significant driver of this business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Fees for the period are ahead of our expectations as performance has improved in the funds that we acquired at the end of last year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Cost of the business include acquisition accounting adjustments of GBP 2 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So bringing together the performance of all our businesses into the group's returns, let me comment on a few aspects of total return.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Total operating expenses for the period were GBP 98 million, which include GBP 8 million relating to Brazil and the new Debt Management team.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Importantly, after taking account of fee income, our net expenses reduced from GBP 59 million to GBP 55 million as the fees in the Debt Management business more than covered additional costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net interest payable reduced to GBP 52 million as we reduce gross debt following the maturity of the remainder of the convertible bond, other planned maturities and the repurchase of EUR 95 million of the June 2012 FRN.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The actuarial loss of GBP 49 million relates mainly to our U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","defined benefits team and reflects a combination of factors.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The market has again had an impact with the value of assets in the scheme and a discount rate used to value the liabilities both falling.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In addition, we have now agreed the latest triannual funding valuation with the scheme's trustees.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have agreed some additional funding contributions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","GBP 60 million  of this was paid in September and a further amount which is expected to be about GBP 36 million will be paid in April 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The accounting for this is not straightforward, but the actuarial loss reflects the affect of both payments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also agreed a contingent asset arrangement with the trustees without any cash or strategic cost of the group, allowing flexibility to proceed with the derisking investment strategy for the fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","NAV was 294p at the 30th of September, falling from 351p at the 31st of March, which 5p is attributable to the full in portfolio value, 5p to the actuarial loss of the pension and the remaining due to operating in interest cost.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have continued to adopt a conservative balance sheet strategy throughout the period, reducing gross debt and managing our cash requirements carefully.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We hold high levels of liquidity to ensure that we can meet our fund commitments, the ongoing funding requirements of the portfolio, our debt maturities, and to take advantage of investment opportunities where appropriate.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This is particularly important in these economic conditions when our ability to refinance debt may be more constrained or more costly and realizations are more uncertain.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You can see from this slide that we finished the period of investment assets of GBP 3.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4 billion and gross debt of GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net debt was more or less unchanged at GBP 531 million and remains within the GBP 1 billion net debt limit that we've set ourselves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Clearing has increased to 19% as a result of the fall in the portfolio value.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Liquidity remains strong at GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7 billion and is made up of cash at GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","2 billion and undrawn committed facilities of GBP 0.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our gross debt has fallen from GBP 2 billion to GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7 billion as this debt has matured.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have successfully continued in our strategy of extending term and reducing absolute maturities in any one year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We note in June that we had refinanced our principal revolving credit facility, extending the maturities to June 2016, increasing the amount from GBP 300 million to GBP 450 million and significantly reducing the cost.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm pleased to confirm that we have now also extended the 2012 bilateral facility, also to 2016 and have reduced that amount from GBP 100 million to GBP 50 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Before handing over to Menno, I wanted to elaborate further on Michael's comments regarding the changes we've announced our distribution policy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Subject of course to shareholder approval, we have today announced our intention to pay a dividend for the year of 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7p being declared as interim dividend today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The cash cost of the dividend is GBP 77 million, which is about the level of cash cost before the rights issue in 2009.",2322
18511,"2011m11","A proportion of this dividend will be funded to capital profits that we've looked at the long-term average on realization levels and are comfortable and sustainable at this level.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As the asset management part of our business grows, we expect the dividend to be funded out of those revenue profits.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So to conclude.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our returns for the 6 months and 30th of September reflect the market conditions and appear a considerable financial uncertainty and volatility.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We are not immune to that, seeing it's affecting the valuation of our portfolio and our pension fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In this market, the most important thing we can do is manage the business cautiously and conservatively, taking steps to increase our margin of safety wherever we can.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have continued to do this throughout the period, meaning we were able to withstand the economic headwinds from a position of strength.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'd now like to hand over to Menno.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We don't actually talk like that anymore because you can get the comparisons but in the discounts that we apply, they're in a range of 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","5% to about 10%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There are couple of outlines much more significant discount the 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","5% discounts apply to companies that have case disposal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Typically where we use 5% in the buyout portfolio and growth capital portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If I pick up the net portfolio return question, yes, you're right, there are different factors happening for both divisions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If you look at debt management, I would say that absolutely in sort of not a startup phase, but we're in the early development of that that strategic initiative.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the amount of capital that we have invested there is actually in the GBP 18 million at the moment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it's extremely sensitive to any changes in the numbers that we have there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In the period that we've seen, the gross portfolio return for debt management was negative as we had some mark to market movements on the equity investment that we have their and given the low level of capital that we have at work, things like that GBP 2 million of acquisition accounting adjustments actually have quite a significant impact.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It would be very, very easy to actually produce a stellar return for debt management given the amount of capital we have at the moment so very much look at that in terms of early days of the development.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But the trajectory for us model that we expect to have is enhancement from our gross portfolio return to a net book value returned 15% return.",2322
18511,"2011m11","For infrastructure, there are 1 or 2 particular things that play in the 6-month period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean overall the business is performing extremely well.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The gross portfolio return has got the quite impact on the Downing Power share that I talked about.",2322
18511,"2011m11","A little bit complicated to understand, but because we expect to manage more third-party money than our own money in contrast to Private Equity, if you have a negative gross portfolio return, there is a reversal in the carry accrual that actually ends up being a cause and you've got a knock on effect of that gross portfolio and impact.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Overall, we expect that the Infrastructure business, which has perform very well as you can see, reflected in the confidence of 3i Group Infrastructure Plc share price to absolutely deliver the 15% of our looking for.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of where we're seeing particular trends, I mean there is some obvious macroeconomic trends that you can see.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So the Northern European companies have tended to outperform U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","and southern European.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Those companies, irrespective of the geography that have a high export component to what they do, particularly to Asia and South America, have outperformed typically domestic businesses.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So those, all of those obvious macro trends are evident.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms and your point about information, we certainly wouldn't want to deprive anybody of information we provided before.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And if you look in your pack, Pages 34 and 35, do give the vintage year performance of both the buyout and growth portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So hopefully, you will see there that, that information is there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And you can see traffic trends in that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What we are seeing in terms of growth and buyout assets, the growth at an operating level, there is no discernible trend between the 2 portfolios.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But clearly, given that the buyout assets tend to be more highly levered, whether seeing pressure on earnings, that will have a greater impact on value than it would do for an equivalent growth company which would be lowly levered.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hi, this is Henry Freeman from liberal capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And interested in your standpoint on buybacks and also, the confidence in the current value of the portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Surely, the opportunities that you're seeing, the new investment opportunities you're seeing, must have quite a significant hurdle in excess of 30% if buybacks are still not seen as a better investment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just a couple of things.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Firstly, I wonder if you cannot a little bit more projects in your external fundraising programs I realize that now is a difficult about maybe where you're looking to raise external funds.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And secondly given what's happening in the Private Equity and service you're shaking your business to that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What you think happens to the competitive dynamics over the next 2 or 3 years, and how does that play to what you've done? Henry Freeman from Liberum Capital again.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just following on from your comments on 3i Infrastructure and the success of that business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I understand that one of your investors has quite publicly called for a distribution of the holding.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Are you first of all considering this? Secondly, would you consider just a straightforward placing of that quite considerable stake in 3i infrastructure? And obviously, this is with regards to the significant discount of which 3i Group trades at while 3i Infrastructure actually trades pretty well to now.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The headline multiple I think was 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","2 EBIT to EBITDA.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That's before discount.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What I wanted to say what it is they would is after discount? So probably don't have the exact numbers but they can and that's what you afterwards Thanks, Menno.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Before we move to Q&A, I want to conclude with some key messages.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Clearly, we continue to operate in a difficult economic environment, and while the steps that we've taken to strengthen the business are very evident, we're certainly not immune to market turmoil and volatility.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Concerns over excessive levels of sovereign debt taken on by many Western governments, combined with political turbulence and deleveraging pressures on the banking system, are likely to lead to increased risk and lower growth, particularly in Europe.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This means that now, more than ever, we need to manage the business with a greater margin of safety than we would do under more stable economic conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Having said that, the actions we've taken have put us in a strong position to withstand this environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our recent investments are performing well, which reflects our renewed focus on investment discipline and effective asset management.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also significantly delevered our investments, particularly in the more highly geared buyer portfolio to give them greater headroom in these uncertain times.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we've reduced our own operating expenses by 1/3 over the past 3 years, it's actually 40%, if you include the Debt Management acquisition.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And in addition, we expect these to fall by about 1/3 at 10% next year as a result of the changes we have announced today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Finally, the board has announced a significantly rebased dividend and progressive dividend distribution policy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This is a sign of the confidence and the long-term delivery of our strategy and a recognition of the progress that we made to date.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Together, these actions have put us in good shape to face a tough market with confidence.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In respect of our portfolio companies, we will continue to provide support and challenge to ensure that they not only weather the economic conditions that they come out the other side in a stronger position, ready to seize the opportunities that our recovery will bring.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Today, we're looking forward to the next stage in our Private Equity businesses development.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Together with the opportunities we're pursuing in infrastructure and Debt Management, we're are well-positioned to deliver on our strategy and maximize value for shareholders for the long-term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We're now happy to take questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me answer the question on fundraising first.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, the fund that we are out on the road with at the moment is in our India Infrastructure Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That's a successive vehicle to the first fund which has been very successful.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As I said, we expect that, that will be closed at some point during 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The debt management business, we would hope would be able to launch a number of different products.",2322
18511,"2011m11","debt management fundraising has been very, very challenging for 3 or 4 years, really since the start of the financial crisis.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Though we are seeing now desire for yield, and our debt management business can certainly provide that in investing in good corporate credit in a relatively lowly or even un-levered way.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So there's a demand for that product.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of private equity fund raising, I mentioned in my statement, we've come to our -- or virtually the end of our Eurofund V investment period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We won't be able to go out on the road and raise a new private equity fund, though, until we finish investing our growth capital fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Because, what we said is our next European private equity or developed markets private equity fund will be a combined growth and buyout fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So as soon as we finished investing all, as we get towards the end of the investment period in growth capital, which is the end of 2012, we will then look to raise another private equity fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of what the market environment is, there are 2 aspects to that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","One is the fundraising environment, which I think is tough as I've ever known it.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I think quite a lot of people or quite a lot of limited partners, the investors in funds, are taking a very long time to consider new propositions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There is a record number of funds, both from North America and Europe on the road at the moment, and fundraisings are taking an incredible length of time, between 20 months and 24 months on the road for a typical fundraising.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So an extraordinary length of time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as you saw from Menno's chart earlier, a relatively small amount of capital is actually being raised in new funds.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So this is a tough environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","How does that impact on us? Well actually, it plays to 3i's advantage to a certain extent because we are one of the few players in our industry with the benefit of permanent capital not, just at the 3i Group level, but through 3i Infrastructure plc as well.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we certainly intend to be in the market, making good investments, notwithstanding all the things I've said about how cautious we are.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But it does mean that we can be in the market effectively doing good deals, and we're not going to be on the road in the next 12 months.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Thanks, Menno.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Before we move to Q&A, I want to conclude with some key messages.",2322

18511,"2011m11","We're now happy to take questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If, actually, what you could do, if could put your hand up and wait for the microphone, because the questions are being webcast as well.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Gentlemen? Just start with the provisions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, I think the provisions are -- they're not exceptional, one way or the other, it's about where we would expect to see.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Clearly, if we see a full meltdown of the Eurozone, that will put significant stress on all companies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So under that environment, we would expect to see provisions increasing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Absent that, and let's assume governments do get their act together and we do see some form stabilization, I wouldn't, in the current environment, expect to see a significant increase in the level of provisioning that we're seeing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There will always be some provisioning, but I don't think it's going to be a dramatic increase on what we've got we got at the moment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the chart you showed on Page 34, looking at the breakdown of returns between multiple expansion growth, et cetera.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Do you have sort of aggregates, money multiple and IRR for those exited investments? It's Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I've got a couple of questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The first one is on earnings and I'm surprised that the magnitude of the GBP 52 million negative due to weaker earnings, you're obviously using 23% of the portfolio, dividing that on a forward earnings basis.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I was wondering if you just give us a bit more color on whether that's sector-specific, geographic-specific.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And do you expect the trend to deteriorate over the next 6 months? The other question is just on the -- they all sort of breakdown just ahead of growth and buyout with no loss though or being lumped together as private equity.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But can you just give us a bit of a feel for how the growth portfolio performed and how the buyout portfolio performed overall? Well, good morning, everyone.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me take you through the agenda for today's briefing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm going to start by giving an overview of the group performance, as well as more detail on the private equity changes that we've announced this morning, and the result of the board's dividend policy review.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Julia will follow with a detailed financial results.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'll then ask Menno Antal to give a bit more color on how the private equity business line is performing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Finally, I'll return to say a few words on the outlook before we open the floor to questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There's no doubt that the last 6 months have presented an extremely difficult operating environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","For financial markets, it's been appeared of considerable uncertainty and fears regarding the future of the Eurozone have severely damaged business confidence in many of our markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i has not been immune to this turmoil, and as you'll see in more detail, as Julia takes you through the financials, our half year performance has been significantly affected by the macroeconomic environment, particularly the impact of falling stock markets on multiples.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We can take some comfort in the underlying performance of our investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On a value-weighted basis, our portfolio earnings have increased 8% in the 6 months, with our more valuable investments tending to be the better performers throughout the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, as I've raised repeatedly through these presentations, our performance has continued to be impacted by the high prices paid and high leverage of assets invested in 2007 and 2008.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On the macroeconomic level, parallels can be drawn between what we're going through now and the first stage of the financial crisis in 2008.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, from a 3i Group perspective, there's a marked contrast between then and now.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The steps we've taken to strengthen our balance sheet were a precaution against exactly the kind of market conditions we're seeing today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also significantly reduced the leverage at the portfolio level.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As an example, the average debt multiple in our buyout portfolio now stands at 4.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4x, down from almost 6x, which gives greater headroom to cope with any temporary fluctuations in performance.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've reduced net debt at the 3i Group level too.",2322
18511,"2011m11","From a peak of GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","9 billion  in 2009 to just over GBP 0.",2322
18511,"2011m11","5 billion today, giving us a stronger position as we enter an increasingly uncertain period for realizations in refinancings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The quality of our asset management and investment capabilities has also been strengthened as evidenced by the performance of recent new investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The teams are very focused on maintaining their investment discipline and managing the portfolio to maximize value.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Another area where we've changed 3i is the cost base.",2322
18511,"2011m11","By adjusting our operational and financial structure, and maintaining a focus on our core competencies, we've reduced operating expenses by 1/3 over the past 3 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Last year, we announced the combination of our European growth and buyout teams to form a single European private equity team.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As we reach the end of the Eurofund V investment period, we are now further reshaping this combined business to reflect the current market condition and the likely new investment environment over the next few years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In addition, we're integrating our U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","team to create a developed markets private equity team.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This will allow operating efficiencies to be achieved, which in turn, enables a reduction of operating expenses by at least GBP 15 million a year from financial year 2012, '13.",2322
18511,"2011m11","These steps reflect the natural progression of our private equity business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The team will be well-positioned to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities as they arise and will have the full support of the 3i balance sheet.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In developing markets private equity, we strengthened our China team with the appointment of Paul Su.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also received an allocation to invest in local currency from the Chinese government.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And in Brazil, we've established an advisory board to support the local team in São Paulo.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The changes in the private equity business also require some changes to the leadership team and a realignment of leadership roles.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As we've already announced, Simon Burrows has joined as Chief Investment Officer, while his predecessor, Ian Nolan, is leaving 3i.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Menno Antal and Alan Giddins will jointly lead our developed markets private equity business, covering Europe and the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11",", and Guy Zarzavatdjian will take over responsibility for developing markets in addition to his current responsibility for the growth capital fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Bob Stefanowski will step down from leadership team to focus on 2 of our larger portfolio companies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In our infrastructure and debt management business lines, performance has been robust, and we're pursuing a number of initiatives.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The European infrastructure assets have performed well, and during the period, 3i Infrastructure's consortium was announced as a preferred bidder on the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","'s Thameslink rail project.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In India, we've launched the second India Infrastructure Fund, which we expect to complete during 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In debt management, the CLO funds are performing ahead of our original business plan, generating good advisory and performance fees.",2322
18511,"2011m11","During this period, we've launched a new Credit Opportunities Fund, initially funded by 3i, which will aim to take advantage of the dislocation that we see in credit markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I now want to turn towards our current priorities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i's first priority is to maximize the value of our existing investments by supporting them through current economic conditions so that they're well-positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities that will follow.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We're also focused on maintaining investment discipline across our business lines.",2322
18511,"2011m11","All the deals we do must be reviewed in the light of constantly changing economic conditions, and we need to ensure that we pay the right price at the right time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's also vitally important that we continue with the conservative balance sheet strategy we followed since 2009.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Doing so will give greater security to all our stakeholders in this uncertain environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","A key part of our strategy is to grow the business in a measured way.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Some good examples of this are the second Indian infrastructure fund raising and the Credit Opportunities Fund that I've already mentioned.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Together, these priorities feed into the delivery of our strategic model, and allow us to provide shareholders with more stable and consistent returns over the economic cycle.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now having introduced our model for returns in May and completed our review of the European private equity business, the board has now decided the appropriate proportion of those returns that should take the form of dividend.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm pleased to announce that, subject to shareholder approval, we're raising the full year dividend to 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","1p per share, and this is an increase of 125% on the previous year, in which we're declaring an interim dividend of 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","From this higher base, we expect to grow the dividend progressively, in line with the performance of the business and its balance sheet strength.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The board has also considered undertaking share buybacks and, while accepting the principle of buybacks, has concluded that such purchases are not appropriate at the current time, particularly given the extreme uncertainty in financial markets and low levels of business and consumer confidence.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And now before I pass to Julia, let me give you the key metrics for the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As I've said, our gross return has been primarily driven by market conditions, most notably the decline in multiples used for valuation purposes.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Although as a whole, our investments have displayed resilient underlying performance, the general softening of market conditions has led to a negative gross investment return of 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","After cost and financing, this results in a negative total return of 15.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Despite the tough environment, we achieved a good level of realizations at GBP 532 million, although most of these were in the first half of this 6-month period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Investment during this period was GBP 448 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our gross debt currently stands at GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7 billion, and taking into account our cash balances, we have net debt of GBP 531 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our liquidity, which includes cash and undrawn facilities, is GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Julia will now take you through these numbers, along with the other financials in more detail.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hi, this is Henry Freeman from Liberum Capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm interested in your standpoint on buybacks and also the confidence in the current value of the portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Surely, the opportunities that you're seeing -- the new investment opportunities you're seeing must have quite a significant hurdle, in excess of 30%, if buybacks are still not seen as a better investment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As Michael has said, our returns for the 6 months of 30 September reflect the market conditions in a period of considerable political, economic, and financial uncertainty and volatility.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We are not immune to that seeing its effect in evaluation of our portfolio and of our pension fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, our balance sheet means that we're able to withstand these headwinds from a position of strength.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This slide shows you the key elements of our returns.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The gross portfolio return reflects the returns directed by our direct investments in the portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net portfolio return reflects the financial impact of running our asset management business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And finally, total return includes the financial effects of our balance sheet.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I will take you through each of these components in more detail in the next few slides.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as I do so, you'll see some new disclosure regarding the performance of our business lines.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Having confirmed our model for returns in May, we're now reporting net portfolio return by business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In addition, I'll also provide you some detail on our valuations in the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our private equity business will always be the most significant component of our gross portfolio return, as our business model assumes that we'll allocate a much more significant proportion of our own capital to private equity than either infrastructure or debt management.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The private equity returns include GBP 25 million of realized profits on gross proceeds of GBP 523 million, which had lower uplifts than normal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, this is due to the timing, with the significant proportion of the value being reflected in uplifts to sale as at the 31 March 2011.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The top 5 disposals were all at very good money multiples, ranging from 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The net GBP 414 million of unrealized write-downs reflect a deterioration in market multiples and some contraction in the earnings that we use for valuations.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And I'll come on to talk about this in more detail shortly.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The gross portfolio return in our infrastructure business principally comprises the quoted movement and dividend income from our 35% stake in 3i Infrastructure plc, offset by unrealized volume movements on investments in our India Infrastructure Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Through our infrastructure share price, has performed very well in the last 6 months, increasing by 3% to 121p at the 30th of September, and offsetting some currency-led value declines in the Indian portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We increased our investments in through our Infrastructure plc by GBP 33 million, exercising the warrants that we received when the company was first listed.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As expected, debt management has minimal effect at the gross portfolio return level as we've invested only 1% of the capital at work in this business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We'd expect this to grow in importance as we invest in new funds such as the recently announced credit opportunities fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Turning then to the valuation of the portfolio, which gives rise to the GBP 441 million negative movements in the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Clearly, market conditions have deteriorated significantly and rapidly since I spoke to you in May.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And our portfolio is not immune to the effects of that, directly in terms of multiples but also in some cases, in performance.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm going to comment on earnings and multiples in more detail shortly, so I'm just going to use this slide to talk about a couple of the other components.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Impairments of GBP 66 million relate to a number of asset, and are a function of the earnings and multiple movements that I'm going to describe.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Provisions are low at GBP 43 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The uplift to imminent sale relates to the disposal of MWM.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You may recall that we announced this disposal last year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm pleased to say that we have received proceeds of GBP 197 million at the start of November.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Finally, the movements on the quoted portfolio, which now accounts for 15% of the total, relates to our residual holding in NORMA which is a business that IPO-ed in April, as well as our 3i Infrastructure plc shares and the Adani Power.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As expected, stock market declines in the period flow through to the multiples that we use to value the portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The overall fall was 8%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On the face of it, this is lower than headline falls in the, say the FTSE 100 of 13%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, it is in line with the movements in the underlying sectors and the geographies in which we have invested.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You can see here the portfolio diversification.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So for example, we have limited exposure in European financials, which had a significant impact on total market movements, and our value exposure to consumer is much more heavily weighted to Asia.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The weighted average EBITDA multiple fell to 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","8x at the 31st of March.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We talk about earnings growth in 2 ways.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Firstly, in explaining the movements and earnings that we use for valuation purposes; and secondly, for considering the performance of the portfolio as a whole.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So looking first at the earnings that we use for valuation purposes, which results in a negative GBP 52 million unrealized value movement.",2322
18511,"2011m11","64% of the portfolio is valued on an earnings basis, and we calculate the movement on those companies that were valued in this way at the start and at the end of the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our valuation policy is to use the last 12 months management accounts up to the preceding quarter, so in this case, to the 30th of June.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But if it is apparent that the current year forecast, in other words to the 31st of December, is showing reduced earnings, then we anticipate that decline and use those forecasts.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The number of companies in this position has increased in this period to 23% reflecting the market conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as a result, the earnings used for valuation purposes showed a contraction of 1%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Looking at earnings as a whole, in aggregate, the earnings in our private equity portfolio grew by 1% in the 6 months, but the weighted average growth in earnings was 8%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It is in that context that we believe the portfolio performance has been solid despite the tough economic conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And this slide shows you some new disclosure about earnings performance of the private equity portfolio, breaking down the last 12 months of earnings performance by value and number of companies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This slide then shows you the effects of those valuations on the total portfolio value.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We began the period with a portfolio of GBP 3.",2322
18511,"2011m11","9 billion, investments of GBP 448 million was measured, and Menno will talk in more detail about some of the new investments in private equity.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Taking account of unrealized losses, divestment, and FX, the portfolio value at the end of the period was reduced to GBP 3.",2322
18511,"2011m11","For the first time we're providing a breakdown of our net portfolio return by business line.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As you'll recall, we set our 15% targets for each of private equity, infrastructure and debt management, on our bridge over 5 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We believe providing this framework allows for a more detailed discussion about the drivers of performance, how we allocate our capital, and how new strategic initiatives are assessed.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So taking each business in turn.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Private equities performance is driven by its gross portfolio return, but the cross cycle target is 20%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We are a significant balance sheet investor here, 82% of our portfolio and 64% of the private equity assets under management.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And so, we expect there to be a dilution from gross to net returns.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Therefore, in a period where market conditions have had a marked effect on the gross portfolio returns, the business will not achieve its 15% target.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Its return is a negative 11%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Fee income in the period is in line with expectations and reflects fees from Eurofund IV and V, as well as the growth capital fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net carry is a positive, as it reflects the reversal of previous accruals following the reduction in portfolio valuing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Over time, we expect net carry to be at cost as we pay carry on total investments but received carry only on the third party money that we manage.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The cost of GBP 74 million  include the new Brazil team and are flat year-on-year, including this additional resource.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In infrastructure, we have said we expect to be managing 75% third party money and 25% of our own capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As of the 30th of September, this ratio was 69:31, reflecting our additional investment of GBP 33 million in the period for 3i Infrastructure plc.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As a result, we expect lower gross returns for this business to be enhanced by fees and carry more than covering costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We still expect this to be the case in the longer term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Today, 3i capital represents only 1% of the assets under management in debt management, although our aim is to invest 10% capital in this business line.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Consequently, we expect fee income to be the most significant driver of this business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Fees for the period are ahead of our expectations as performance has improved in the funds that we acquired at the end of last year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Cost of the business include acquisition accounting adjustments of GBP 2 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So bringing together the performance of all our businesses into the group's returns, let me comment on a few aspects of total return.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Total operating expenses for the period were GBP 98 million, which include GBP 8 million relating to Brazil and the new debt management team.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Importantly, after taking account of fee income, our net expenses reduced from GBP 59 million to GBP 55 million, as the fees from the debt management business more than covered additional costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net interest payable reduced to GBP 52 million, as we reduced gross debt following the maturity of the remainder of the convertible bond, other planned maturities, and the repurchase of EUR 95 million of the June 2012 FRN.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The actuarial loss of GBP 49 million relates mainly to our U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","defined benefits team and reflects a combination of factors.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The market has -- again had an impact, with the value of assets in the scheme and a discount rate used to value the liabilities both falling.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In addition, we have now agreed the latest tri-annual funding valuation with the scheme's trustees.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have agreed some additional funding contributions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","GBP 60 million of this was paid in September and a further amount, which is expected to be about GBP 36 million, will be paid in April 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The accounting for this is not straightforward, but the actuarial loss reflects the affect of both payments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also agreed a contingent asset arrangement with the trustees without any cash or strategic cost to the group, allowing flexibility to proceed with the de-risking investment strategy for the fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","NAV was 294p at the 30th of September, falling from 351p at the 31st of March.",2322
18511,"2011m11","35p was attributable to the fall in portfolio value, 5p to the actuarial loss of the pension, and the remainder due to operating and interest costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have continued to adopt a conservative balance sheet strategy throughout the period, reducing gross debt and managing our cash requirements carefully.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We hold high levels of liquidity to ensure that we can meet our fund commitments, the ongoing funding requirements of the portfolio, our debt maturities, and to take advantage of investment opportunities where appropriate.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This is particularly important in these economic conditions when our ability to refinance debt may be more constrained or more costly and realizations are more uncertain.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You can see from this slide that we finished the period of investment assets of GBP 3.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4 billion and gross debt of GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net debt was more or less unchanged at GBP 531 million and remains within the GBP 1 billion net debt limit that we've set ourselves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Gearing has increased to 19% as a result of the fall in the portfolio value.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Liquidity remains strong at GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7 billion and is made up of cash at GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","2 billion, and undrawn committed facilities of GBP 0.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our gross debt has fallen from GBP 2 billion to GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7 billion as debt has matured.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have successfully continued in our strategy of extending term and reducing absolute maturities in any one year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We note in June that we had refinanced our principal revolving credit facility, extending the maturities to June 2016, increasing the amount from GBP 300 million to GBP 450 million, and significantly reducing the costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm pleased to confirm that we have now also extended the 2012 bilateral facility, also to 2016 and have reduced it's amount from GBP 100 million to GBP 50 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Before handing over to Menno, I wanted to elaborate further on Michael's comments regarding changes we've announced to our distribution policy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Subject of course to shareholder approval, we have today announced our intention to pay a dividend for the year of 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7p being declared as interim dividend today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The cash cost of the dividend is GBP 77 million, which is about the level of cash cost before the rights issue in 2009.",2322
18511,"2011m11","A proportion of this dividend will be funded out of capital profits, but we've looked at the long-term average of our realization levels and are comfortable that it is sustainable at this level.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As the asset management part of our business grows, we expect the dividend to be funded out of those revenue profits.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So to conclude.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our returns for the 6 months and 30th of September reflect the market conditions in a period of considerable financial uncertainty and volatility.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We are not immune to that, seeing it's affecting the valuation of our portfolio and our pension fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In this market, the most important thing we can do is manage the business cautiously and conservatively, taking steps to increase our margin of safety wherever we can.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have continued to do this throughout the period, meaning we were able to withstand the economic headwinds from a position of strength.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'd now like to hand over to Menno.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We don't actually calculate that anymore because we can't get the comparisons, but in terms of the discounts that we apply, they're in a range of 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","5% to about 10%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There are couple of outlies that have a much more significant discount.",2322
18511,"2011m11","5% discount subsidy applied to companies that are very close to disposal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Typically, we will use 5% in the buyouts portfolio and 10% in the growth capital portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The chart on Page 34, I think it was in Menno's part of the presentation, showed where the value had come from the exited investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wondered whether you had the money multiple for those investments in the IRR.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Monica Tepes, Westhouse Securities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If I could ask 2 questions please.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So first of all, your outlook on realizations and new investments in the short to medium term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I don't know if you had many companies that maybe -- or in advanced negotiation of selling and, given market conditions, it all came to a stop and, really, what you expect in terms that investors can expect? So we probably don't have the exact numbers to hand to you, Chris, but we can always, say, pick that up with afterwards.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So if I pick up your question, first of all, on the use of forecast earnings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Yes, you're right.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That is a big factor in resulting in a contraction for the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And at least, as you said, it's 23% of companies are on a basis at this time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, that's actually quite a spread of companies, to the extent this trends -- there's a number of U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","companies that are in there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So that's consistent with what we've talked about in the macro environment that we've seen.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If we hadn't included those forecast earnings, so if it was sort of consistent with the way that companies are valued in quoted markets, then we would've seen an overall increase in the earnings used to value the portfolio, between 3% and 4%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it is part of that conservatism that we built into our strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, to the extent of what do I expect that to do over the next 6 months, it's quite difficult to predict.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, clearly when we're doing our valuations, we did those in September, we were taking account of as much management information that we had at that time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The march process will have the benefits of including final accounts and the budgets to the following year and so we will see where that ends up.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As Michael has said, we're operating in pretty tough economic conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So I would expect to see that same, at least, similar to sort of forecast to earnings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If I pick up the net portfolio return question, yes, you're right.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There are different factors happening for both divisions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If you look at debt management, I would say that absolutely is in sort of a -- not quite a startup phase, but we're in the early development of that strategic initiative.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the amount of capital that we have invested there is actually GBP 18 million at the moment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it's extremely sensitive to any changes in the numbers that we have there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In the period that we've seen, the gross portfolio return for debt management was negative as we had some mark-to-market movements on the equity investment that we have their.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And given the low level of capital that we have at work, things like that GBP 2 million of acquisition accounting adjustments actually have caused a significant impact.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It would be very, very easy to actually produce a stellar return for debt management given that amount of capital we've got at the moment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So very much look at that in terms of early days of strategic development.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But the trajectory for us, in terms of the model that we expect to have, is enhancement from our gross portfolio return, to our net book value return, to get an overall 15% return.",2322
18511,"2011m11","For infrastructure, there are 1 or 2 particular things that play in the 6-month period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, overall, the business is performing extremely well.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The gross portfolio return has got the quoted impact on the Adani Power share that I've talked about.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And a little bit complicated to understand, but because we expect to manage more third-party money than our own money, in contrast to private Equity, if you have a negative gross portfolio return, there is a reversal in the carry accrual that actually ends up being a cost.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So you've got a knock-on effect to that gross portfolio and impact.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Overall, we expect that the infrastructure business, which has perform very well, as you can see reflected in the confidence of our own Infrastructure plc share price to absolutely deliver the 15% of our looking for.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just one more quick question.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The headline multiple I think was 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","2 EB to EBITDA, that's before discount.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wanted to see what it is after discount? Good morning, everyone and welcome, again.",2322
18511,"2011m11","My job is very simple and that's just simply to let you know that if the fire alarm goes for any reason, you need to move out from the back please.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And also, if you could, please turn your mobiles and any other devices off that might interfere with the microphones because this morning's presentation is being webcast.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So without further ado, I'd like to introduce Chief Executive Michael Queen.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of where we're seeing particular trends, I mean, there is some obvious macroeconomic trends that you can see.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So the Northern European companies have tended to outperform U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","and Southern European.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Those companies, irrespective of their geography that have a high export component to what they do, particularly to Asia and South America, have outperformed typically domestic businesses.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So all of those obvious macro trends are evident.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms -- at the your point about information, we certainly wouldn't want to deprive anybody of information we provided before.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And if you look in your pack, Pages 34 and 35, do give the vintage year performance of both the buyouts and growth portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So hopefully, you will see there that, that information is there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And you can see, track trends in that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What we are seeing in terms of growth and buyout assets, the growth at an operating level, there is no discernible trend between the 2 portfolios.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But clearly, given that the buyout assets tend to be more highly levered, where they're seeing pressure on earnings, that will have a greater impact on value than it would do for an equivalent growth company which would be lowly levered.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Well the board has considered whether it's appropriate to conduct buybacks in the current market and felt that, given the uncertainties around refinancing and our need to continue to rollover certain parts of our gross borrowings, that it was just too uncertain an environment to embark on that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What we also need to do is to make sure that we continue to meet our fiduciary responsibilities in respect to the funds that we manage.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We raise these funds and we charge fees on the basis that we will invest in assets over a given timeframe.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And it's very important that we continue to do that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And clearly, 3i's investment in those assets, it's important to meet that because we intend to continue to raise funds going forward.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So while mathematically, if the share is traded at a discount to net assets, it's unassailable logic that buying those shares on that basis would boost the NAV per share.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's not necessarily in the long-term interest of shareholders for us to do that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And that's what the board has taken into account in coming out with a decision today, that in the current time we would not undertake buybacks.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now that's not to say that, that will be the position forever.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We don't have a principled objection to buy that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We absolutely see buybacks as an appropriate form of the cycle.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But given the risks in the macro environment today, we are not going to be doing that in the near term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Thank you, Julia, and good morning, everyone.",2322
18511,"2011m11","My name is Menno Antal, I'm Dutch.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm an engineer by education and complemented by an MBA from IMD.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Before joining 3i, I worked for 10 years at Heineken in different international, operational, commercial, and general management roles.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I joined 3i in 2000 to help build the Benelux office in Amsterdam, of which I became a Managing Director in 2003.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In 2009, I took over responsibility for Germany, followed by the Nordic region in 2010.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I also became part of the leadership team in 2010.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What I would like to do in this presentation is to provide a brief update on the European private equity markets and to explain our strategy within these markets, particularly against a market backdrop that continues to present challenges.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Then to take you through the recent investment activities to demonstrate actually why I believe we will be successful in delivering good returns in the medium term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Through this presentation, I'd also like to give you a clear understanding of the changes of private equity business as announced by Michael earlier.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me begin when the European Private Equity markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The investment activities have come up significantly since '07, '08.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Even if the large cap markets has suffered most, the mid-market has also been impacted, and investment levels are now comparable to the years of 2003 and 2004.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In 2010 and first half of 2011, we saw an upward trend in activity levels.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, since the beginning of August, the euro crisis has had a significant impact on the market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The third quarter, to the end of September, is showing a 41% decline in investment activity on the previous quarter.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's our expectation that these conditions will prevail well into 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, there are clear regional differences across the European market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have an excellent investment track record over the past 10 years, in Germany, to Benelux, France, and the Nordic region.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i is very well-positioned in these markets and we continue to see attractive investment opportunities, given the quality of the companies that we're seeing, the strength of the management teams, and our ability to help these businesses achieve their international potential.",2322
18511,"2011m11",", we obviously have a very strong position.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In the short term, we expect the current economic conditions to continue in the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11",", and combined with the intense competition we are seeing for good quality assets, means that we will remain highly selective.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That said, I'm confident that we will find attractive opportunities in this market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The Spanish and Italian markets show even greater challenges.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Making new investments in these markets does not look attractive in the near term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, we are have a very good market position in Spain, and a high-quality team to create value from the existing large portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Turning to our strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On the right side of the slides, I've set out our key competitive advantages, and on the left, the deal criteria which are based on these advantages.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our target market is investments with an enterprise value of up to EUR 500 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We consider this to be the mid-market where local relationships are of high importance, and where companies are focused on international growth, which plays to our strengths.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our key competitive advantage is the global presence that we have, with local offices that are deeply rooted in their respective business communities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I believe this is unique in the European mid-market, particularly when combined with our presence and experience of markets such as India, China, and most recently, Brazil.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our global network helps us to assess the international growth opportunity of a given investment and subsequently determine a strategy to ensure its execution.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Another key advantage is our sector knowledge, and the people and network we've built around the sectors.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This not only makes us proactive in our investment approach, but also the long-term track records that we have built in these sectors provides the opportunity to work with best-in-class chairman and operators giving us real credibility with management teams when we are pursuing a deal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As you would expect, and entirely consistent with the private equity investment model, we focus on bringing operational improvements to each of our investments through our Active Partnership program, which is crucial to driving value, particularly in this current environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In the case that I'll discuss in a moment will give you a clear sense of what I mean.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But first, let me take you through our recent investment activity.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have made 13 new investments since the rights issue in 2009, to which we have rigorously applied the investment disciplines that I have just described.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In your presentation packs you will find an overview of each of these investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Performance is very promising, with 85% of these companies performing in line or ahead of plan, and we have clear visibility of those companies that are not performing to plan.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Turning to the 3 most recent buyouts, set out on this slide, let me provide some greater detail to demonstrate how we apply our investment criteria to each new investment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","SMT is a European, U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","testing and inspections business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We know this sector well and our cross Atlantic consolidation strategy plays to our strengths year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As part of the strategy, we see a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities in both Europe and the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Trading performance is strong with current organic growth of 25%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This now translates into a purchase price of less than 8x 2011 EBITDA, down from 9.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Another recent investment is Action, a Dutch discount retailer we were able to acquire in an off-market transaction from the founders.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We regard the business as noncyclical and highly defensive given its discount offering.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The company has delivered 21% growth on average each of the past 5 years, and we see a continuation of that growth again this year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now you can see that the international booked has not picked.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we have indeed not built our base business assumptions on an international rollout.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, despite the strong growth we are seeing in Action's domestic market will, we intend to pursue a strategy to internationalize the business, to accelerate growth, and maximize the potential of this investment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let now turn to Hilite in into more detail.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hilite is a classic 3i buyout.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This is a EUR 190 million acquisition of a non-core, German subsidiary of a U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","company, through our German and U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We run this deal on the back of our track records in the automotive and engineering sector based on what we achieved with investment such as MWM, Hyva, and NORMA, all investments which have delivered fabulous returns over the last 12 to 18 months.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hilite is a leading global supplier of fuel efficiency and emissions reductions components, with annual sales of around EUR 300 million, and a very positive sales outlook.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The majority of its sales for the next 4 years have already been contracted.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Management was attracted to 3i's track record in the automotive industry, our ability to further internationalize businesses, along with our active partnership approach to drive further efficiencies from across the business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We regard this as one of the most exciting segments of the automotive industry.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hilite is the innovation leader, and we see real potential to grow the business internationally, particularly in China.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Since the investment, we've been able to strengthen management, bringing the former chairman of NORMA, and former executives from Siemens and GE to the company.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now based on current performance, we completed the deal at 5.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4x 2011 EBITDA, which makes it very attractively priced.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Many of you will be familiar with the following, which sets out are private equity track record over the last 10 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The total equity value at exit the state of net realized losses, I believe that our recent investment -- apologies for that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I therefore believe that this is a good proxy for the track record of the private equity business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Despite the impact of performance of  recent vintages.",2322
18511,"2011m11","An enormous amount of work has been done to mitigate portfolio risk.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have reinforced our investment procedures, financial risk, and government processes to apply realistic investment parameters that recognize current operating environment in which we are investing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also reduced the leverage across the buyer portfolio from around 6x EBITDA to 4.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4x, with over 85% of the portfolio not having any maturities due before 2014.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The further changes that we are bringing to our business today, built on the initiatives we have implemented under Michael's leadership, these changes will strengthen our position for both today's and tomorrow's markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In summary, with the changes that we have made to the team over the past year, including today, we have in place a high-quality team, which is determined to succeed and to deliver really good returns.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I believe our recent investments demonstrate that even in the current markets, we are able to find exciting investment opportunities, with significant growth strategies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I would now like to hand back to Michael.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we've announced the investment in Etanco, which wasn't invested in the 30th of September.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So my pro forma net debt is about GBP 100 million better than we numbered 30th of September.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I think it's comparable to kind of the 10-year track record IRRs that was referred to, that's in the back of that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So to be clear, my comments around using capital profits was to acknowledge that if you look at our cash flow in any 1 year at the moment, then clearly there's an element of funding dividend out of capital cash flows.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of the reserves that we will use to pay the dividend, for now until the new investment trust rules come into operation, then we will be using our revenue reserve.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There is ample in the revenue reserve, taking account of the dividend that we've announced today and assuming no further revenue profits generated, then we have at least 2 years covered in our revenue reserve, but we are absolutely expecting the changes to come through by the next financial period, which will give us much flexibility in terms of our ability to pay out of our reserves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Philip Middleton from Merrill.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just a couple of things.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Firstly, I wonder if you could update us a little bit more about your external fundraising programs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I realize that now is a difficult time, but maybe over the next 12 months, where you're looking to raise external funds.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And secondly, given what's happening in the private equity industry, obviously, you're shaping your business to that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What do you think happens to the competitive dynamics over the next 2 or 3 years, and how does that play to what you've done? 3i Infrastructure, I think, is a great performing business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, fundamentally, it does what it says on the tenet, it that provides very, very stable, secure return with a high yield component.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's a key part of our infrastructure strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And what we've said, in all of our business lines, is we will have a mix of our own balance sheet capital and third-party capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the way in which we do that, in say private equity, is we raise funds with limited partners.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The way we do that in Infrastructure is we have a listed permanent capital vehicle that we hold a stake in.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it's a fundamental part of our strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we have absolutely no intention of selling that stake or distributing it in specie.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now, the shareholder concerns that raised that, we haven't had the opportunity to speak to them because they didn't raise it with us before going public, and we were in a close period, so we haven't been able to go about and really understand what their thinking was.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But certainly, as part of this roadshow, we will be having that discussion.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But we've got no intention of selling our stake.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Well, if there are no further questions, thank you very much for coming along today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If you do think of any other questions during the course of the day, Julia and Menno and I will be very happy to answer them.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But thank you very much for coming.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just a few questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Some of these quite short.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wondered what the pro forma gearing is, because obviously you've had the MWM proceeds since the year end.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Has there been any big investments to offset that? And in terms of your cost question.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, fundamentally, we are a people business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So if we're looking at a 10% cost reduction next year, that really flows through to a 10% headcount fall.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So most of the costs are there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Why can we deliver that? Well fundamentally, over time, the sheer volume of our portfolio has been falling.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's a more concentrated portfolio, than even 2 or 3 years ago, and that creates the opportunity for managing things in a slightly more efficient way.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We're continually looking at the way how our processes work, not just in terms of investment processes, but all our back office processes.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we're able to the continually improve systems.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it's a combination of things continually looking at all aspects of the business, in other words, doing to ourselves what we do see each of our portfolio companies in terms of driving efficiency out of the business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So I gave you -- the rate of the top 5 is 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean we certainly have flagged today that we expect the environment for realizations, over the next 6 to 12 months, to be particularly challenging.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As Menno outlined, the activity level, both realizations and new investments in private equity is back at the 2003, 2004 level.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You could even see that actually falling back further than that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It really does depend on how the Eurozone crisis impacts on the banking market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Right now, the banks are closed for business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So that will have an impact, both on the ability to fund new investments and also on other people's ability to buy investments in our portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we have had, in the last 6 months, 1 process where we backed out a bit because the funding climate have got more challenging.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as I said in my statement, we were very fortunate we got most of the realizations of this period in the early part of the period when the markets were pretty much functional.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we are anticipating a slower period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Given the sheer scale of our portfolio, there will always be some level of churn, and we do have some visibility on some realizations coming through.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But we are flagging it's going to be in a difficult environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And on the other side of that means that we're going to be highly selective in investment, making sure we're only paying the right value for businesses and making sure that, that value reflects the uncertainties in the market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Henry Freeman from Liberum Capital, again, sorry.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just following on from your comments on 3i Infrastructure and the success of that business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I understand that one of your investors has quite publicly called for a distribution of the holding.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Are you, first of all, considering this? Secondly, would you consider just a straightforward placing of that quite considerable stake in 3i infrastructure? And obviously, this is with regards to the significant discount of which 3i Group trades at while 3i Infrastructure actually trades pretty well to now.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the final question really was about dividend reserve, our revenue reserves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wonder whether you can say a bit about that and to what extent you'd be able to finance the dividend, going forward, from revenues.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You implied, you'd be happy to use a bit of capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wondered, technically, what the reserve position was.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Daniel Garrod from Barclays here.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Three quick questions for me.",2322
18511,"2011m11","First, I wonder if you can provide a bit more color on the 10% cost reductions that you've outlined for next year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I think you sort of said that, that's combining the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","developed markets, the division of the European ones.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Can you give any more color around sort of headcount reductions, relocations, office closures that is behind that GBP 15 million figure? Second, the improved disclosure on the divisional basis, with the net portfolio return.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I was a little surprised to see that debt management and infrastructure are sort of breakeven on loss-making there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You haven't sort of yet achieved the sort of size and the proportion of third-party funding that you would like and that the returns will improve when, structurally, you can receive that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And third question is on the sort of provisions element around your unrealized losses, still very low there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Not really ticked up despite the deteriorating economic environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Is your expectation that we will see that sort of increase a little bit over sort of next 6 months or so in that particular element? So we've announced the investment in Etanco, which wasn't invested in the 30th of September.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So my pro forma net debt is about GBP 100 million better than the number at 30th of September.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We don't actually calculate that anymore because we can't get the comparisons, but in terms of the discounts that we apply, they're in a range of 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","5% to about 10%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There are a couple of outliers that have a much more significant discount.",2322
18511,"2011m11","5% discount subsidy applied to companies that are very close to disposal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Typically, we will use 5% in the buyouts portfolio and 10% in the growth capital portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Henry Freeman from Liberum Capital again.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just following on from your comments on 3i Infrastructure and the success of that business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I understand that one of your investors has quite publicly called for a distribution of the holding.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Are you, first of all, considering this? Secondly, would you consider just a straightforward placing of that quite considerable stake in 3i Infrastructure? And obviously, this is with regards to the significant discount at which 3i Group trades at, while 3i Infrastructure actually trades pretty well to now.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Thank you, Julia, and good morning, everyone.",2322
18511,"2011m11","My name is Menno Antal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm an engineer by education and complemented by an MBA from IMD.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Before joining 3i, I worked for 10 years at Heineken in different international, operational, commercial, and general management roles.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I joined 3i in 2000 to help build the Benelux office in Amsterdam, of which I became a Managing Director in 2003.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In 2009, I took over responsibility for Germany, followed by the Nordic region in 2010.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I also became part of the leadership team in 2010.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What I would like to do in this presentation is to provide a brief update on the European private equity markets and to explain our strategy within these markets, particularly against a market backdrop that continues to present challenges, then to take you through the recent investment activities to demonstrate actually why I believe we will be successful in delivering good returns in the medium term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Through this presentation, I'd also like to give you a clear understanding of the changes of the private equity business as announced by Michael earlier.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me begin with the European private equity markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The investment activities have come off significantly since '07, '08.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Even if the large cap markets has suffered most, the mid-market has also been impacted, and investment levels are now comparable to the years of 2003 and 2004.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In 2010 and first half of 2011, we saw an upward trend in activity levels.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, since the beginning of August, the euro crisis has had a significant impact on the market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The third quarter, to the end of September, is showing a 41% decline in investment activity on the previous quarter.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's our expectation that these conditions will prevail well into 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, there are clear regional differences across the European market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have an excellent investment track record over the past 10 years, in Germany, the Benelux, France and the Nordic region.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i is very well-positioned in these markets and we continue to see attractive investment opportunities, given the quality of the companies that we're seeing, the strength of the management teams, and our ability to help these businesses achieve their international potential.",2322
18511,"2011m11",", we obviously have a very strong position.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In the short term, we expect the current economic conditions to continue in the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11",", and combined with the intense competition we are seeing for good-quality assets, means that we will remain highly selective.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That said, I'm confident that we will find attractive opportunities in this market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The Spanish and Italian markets show even greater challenges.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Making new investments in these markets does not look attractive in the near term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, we have a very good market position in Spain, and a high-quality team to create value from the existing large portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Turning to our strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On the right side of the slides, I've set out our key competitive advantages, and on the left, the deal criteria which are based on these advantages.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our target market is investments with an enterprise value of up to EUR 500 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We consider this to be the mid-market, where local relationships are of high importance, and where companies are focused on international growth, which plays to our strengths.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our key competitive advantage is the global presence that we have, with local offices that are deeply rooted in their respective business communities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I believe this is unique in the European mid-market, particularly when combined with our presence and experience of markets such as India, China, and most recently, Brazil.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our global network helps us to assess the international growth opportunity of a given investment and subsequently determine a strategy to ensure its execution.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Another key advantage is our sector knowledge, and the people and network we've built around the sectors.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This not only makes us proactive in our investment approach, but also the long-term track records that we have built in these sectors provides the opportunity to work with best-in-class chairmen and operators, giving us real credibility with management teams when we are pursuing a deal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As you would expect, and entirely consistent with the private equity investment model, we focus on bringing operational improvements to each of our investments through our Active Partnership program, which is crucial to driving value, particularly in this current environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The case that I'll discuss in a moment will give you a clear sense of what I mean.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But first, let me take you through our recent investment activity.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have made 13 new investments since the rights issue in 2009, to which we have rigorously applied the investment disciplines that I have just described.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In your presentation packs you will find an overview of each of these investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Performance is very promising, with 85% of these companies performing in line or ahead of plan, and we have clear visibility of those companies that are not performing to plan.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Turning to the 3 most recent buyouts, set out on this slide, let me provide some greater detail to demonstrate how we apply our investment criteria to each new investment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","SMT is a European/U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","testing and inspections business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We know this sector well and our cross-Atlantic consolidation strategy plays to our strengths here.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As part of the strategy, we see a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities in both Europe and the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Trading performance is strong with current organic growth of 25%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This now translates into a purchase price of less than 8x 2011 EBITDA, down from 9.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Another recent investment is Action, a Dutch discount retailer we were able to acquire in an off-market transaction from the founders.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We regard the business as noncyclical and highly defensive given its discount offering.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The company has delivered 21% growth on average each of the past 5 years, and we see a continuation of that growth again this year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now you can see that the international booked has not picked.",2322
18511,"2011m11","[ph] And we have indeed not built our base business assumptions on an international rollout.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, despite the strong growth we are seeing in Action's domestic market, we intend to pursue a strategy to internationalize the business, to accelerate growth, and maximize the potential of this investment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me now turn to Hilite in some more detail.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hilite is a classic 3i buyout.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This is a EUR 190 million acquisition of a non-core German subsidiary of a U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","company, through our German and U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We won this deal on the back of our track records in the automotive and engineering sector, based on what we achieved with investment such as MWM, Hyva, and NORMA, all investments which have delivered fabulous returns over the last 12 to 18 months.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hilite is a leading global supplier of fuel efficiency and emissions reductions components, with annual sales of around EUR 300 million, and a very positive sales outlook.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The majority of its sales for the next 4 years have already been contracted.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Management was attracted to 3i's track record in the automotive industry, our ability to further internationalize businesses, along with our active partnership approach to drive further efficiencies from across the business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We regard this as one of the most exciting segments of the automotive industry.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hilite is the innovation leader, and we see real potential to grow the business internationally, particularly in China.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Since the investment, we've been able to strengthen management, bringing the former chairman of NORMA and former executives from Siemens and GE to the company.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now based on current performance, we completed the deal at 5.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4x 2011 EBITDA, which makes it very attractively priced.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Many of you will be familiar with the following, which sets out our private equity track record over the last 10 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The total equity value at exit the state of net realized losses, I believe that our recent investment -- apologies for that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I therefore believe that this is a good proxy for the track record of the private equity business, despite the impact of performance of  recent vintages.",2322
18511,"2011m11","An enormous amount of work has been done to mitigate portfolio risk.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have reinforced our investment procedures, financial risk and government processes to apply realistic investment parameters that recognize current operating environment in which we are investing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also reduced the leverage across the buyout portfolio from around 6x EBITDA to 4.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4x, with over 85% of the portfolio not having any maturities due before 2014.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The further changes that we are bringing to our business today, built on the initiatives we have implemented under Michael's leadership, these changes will strengthen our position for both today's and tomorrow's markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In summary, with the changes that we have made to the team over the past year, including today, we have in place a high-quality team, which is determined to succeed and to deliver really good returns.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I believe our recent investments demonstrate that even in the current markets, we are able to find exciting investment opportunities, with significant growth strategies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I would now like to hand back to Michael.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hi, this is Henry Freeman from Liberum Capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm interested in your standpoint on buybacks and also the confidence in the current value of the portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Surely, the opportunities that you're seeing -- the new investment opportunities you're seeing must have quite a significant hurdle, in excess of 30%, if buybacks are still not seen as a better investment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Well, good morning, everyone.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me take you through the agenda for today's briefing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm going to start by giving an overview of the group performance, as well as more detail on the private equity changes that we've announced this morning, and the result of the board's dividend policy review.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Julia will follow with the detailed financial results.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'll then ask Menno Antal to give a bit more color on how the private equity business line is performing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Finally, I'll return to say a few words on the outlook before we open the floor to questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There's no doubt that the last 6 months have presented an extremely difficult operating environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","For financial markets, it's been a period of considerable uncertainty, and fears regarding the future of the Eurozone have severely damaged business confidence in many of our markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i has not been immune to this turmoil, and as you'll see in more detail as Julia takes you through the financials, our half year performance has been significantly affected by the macroeconomic environment, particularly the impact of falling stock markets on multiples.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We can take some comfort in the underlying performance of our investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On a value-weighted basis, our portfolio earnings have increased 8% in the 6 months, with our more valuable investments tending to be the better performers throughout the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, as I've raised repeatedly through these presentations, our performance has continued to be impacted by the high prices paid and high leverage of assets invested in 2007 and 2008.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On the macroeconomic level, parallels can be drawn between what we're going through now and the first stage of the financial crisis in 2008.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, from a 3i Group perspective, there's a marked contrast between then and now.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The steps we've taken to strengthen our balance sheet were a precaution against exactly the kind of market conditions we're seeing today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also significantly reduced the leverage at the portfolio level.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As an example, the average debt multiple in our buyout portfolio now stands at 4.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4x, down from almost 6x, which gives greater headroom to cope with any temporary fluctuations in performance.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've reduced net debt at the 3i Group level too, from a peak of GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","9 billion  in 2009 to just over GBP 0.",2322
18511,"2011m11","5 billion today, giving us a stronger position as we enter an increasingly uncertain period for realizations in refinancings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The quality of our asset management and investment capabilities has also been strengthened as evidenced by the performance of recent new investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The teams are very focused on maintaining their investment discipline and managing the portfolio to maximize value.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Another area where we've changed 3i is the cost base.",2322
18511,"2011m11","By adjusting our operational and financial structure, and maintaining a focus on our core competencies, we've reduced operating expenses by 1/3 over the past 3 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Last year, we announced the combination of our European growth and buyout teams to form a single European private equity team.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As we reach the end of the Eurofund V investment period, we are now further reshaping this combined business to reflect the current market condition and the likely new investment environment over the next few years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In addition, we're integrating our U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","team to create a developed markets private equity team.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This will allow operating efficiencies to be achieved, which in turn, enables a reduction of operating expenses by at least GBP 15 million a year from financial year 2012-13.",2322
18511,"2011m11","These steps reflect the natural progression of our private equity business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The team will be well positioned to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities as they arise and will have the full support of the 3i balance sheet.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In developing markets private equity, we strengthened our China team with the appointment of Paul Su.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also received an allocation to invest in local currency from the Chinese government.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And in Brazil, we've established an advisory board to support the local team in São Paulo.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The changes in the private equity business also require some changes to the leadership team and a realignment of leadership roles.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As we've already announced, Simon Burrows has joined as Chief Investment Officer, while his predecessor, Ian Nolan, is leaving 3i.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Menno Antal and Alan Giddins will jointly lead our developed markets private equity business, covering Europe and the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11",", and Guy Zarzavatdjian will take over responsibility for developing markets in addition to his current responsibility for the Growth Capital Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Bob Stefanowski will step down from the leadership team to focus on 2 of our larger portfolio companies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In our Infrastructure and Debt Management business lines, performance has been robust, and we're pursuing a number of initiatives.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The European infrastructure assets have performed well, and during the period, 3i Infrastructure's consortium was announced as a preferred bidder on the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","'s Thameslink rail project.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In India, we've launched the second India Infrastructure Fund, which we expect to complete during 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In debt management, the CLO funds are performing ahead of our original business plan, generating good advisory and performance fees.",2322
18511,"2011m11","During this period, we've launched a new Credit Opportunities Fund, initially funded by 3i, which will aim to take advantage of the dislocation that we see in credit markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I now want to turn towards our current priorities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i's first priority is to maximize the value of our existing investments by supporting them through current economic conditions so that they're well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities that will follow.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We're also focused on maintaining investment discipline across our business lines.",2322
18511,"2011m11","All the deals we do must be reviewed in the light of constantly changing economic conditions, and we need to ensure that we pay the right price at the right time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's also vitally important that we continue with the conservative balance sheet strategy we followed since 2009.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Doing so will give greater security to all our stakeholders in this uncertain environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","A key part of our strategy is to grow the business in a measured way.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Some good examples of this are the second Indian infrastructure fund raising and the Credit Opportunities Fund that I've already mentioned.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Together, these priorities feed into the delivery of our strategic model, and allow us to provide shareholders with more stable and consistent returns over the economic cycle.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now having introduced our model for returns in May and completed our review of the European private equity business, the board has now decided the appropriate proportion of those returns that should take the form of dividend.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm pleased to announce that, subject to shareholder approval, we're raising the full year dividend to 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","1p per share, and this is an increase of 125% on the previous year, of which we're declaring an interim dividend of 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","From this higher base, we expect to grow the dividend progressively, in line with the performance of the business and its balance sheet strength.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The board has also considered undertaking share buybacks and, while accepting the principle of buybacks, has concluded that such purchases are not appropriate at the current time, particularly given the extreme uncertainty in financial markets and low levels of business and consumer confidence.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And now before I pass to Julia, let me give you the key metrics for the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As I've said, our gross return has been primarily driven by market conditions, most notably the decline in multiples used for valuation purposes.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Although as a whole, our investments have displayed resilient underlying performance, the general softening of market conditions has led to a negative gross investment return of 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","After cost and financing, this results in a negative total return of 15.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Despite the tough environment, we achieved a good level of realizations at GBP 532 million, although most of these were in the first half of this 6-month period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Investment during this period was GBP 448 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our gross debt currently stands at GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7 billion, and taking into account our cash balances, we have net debt of GBP 531 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our liquidity, which includes cash and undrawn facilities, is GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Julia will now take you through these numbers, along with the other financials, in more detail.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Well, the board has considered whether it's appropriate to conduct buybacks in the current market and felt that, given the uncertainties around refinancing and our need to continue to roll over certain parts of our gross borrowings, that it was just too uncertain an environment to embark on that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What we also need to do is to make sure that we continue to meet our fiduciary responsibilities in respect to the funds that we manage.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We raise these funds and we charge fees on the basis that we will invest in assets over a given timeframe.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And it's very important that we continue to do that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And clearly, 3i's investment in those assets, it's important to meet that because we intend to continue to raise funds going forward.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So while mathematically, if the shares trade at a discount to net assets, it's unassailable logic that buying those shares on that basis would boost the NAV per share.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's not necessarily in the long-term interest of shareholders for us to do that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And that's what the board has taken into account in coming out with a decision today, that in the current time we would not undertake buybacks.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now that's not to say that, that will be the position forever.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We don't have a principled objection to buybacks.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We absolutely see buybacks as an appropriate form of the cycle.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But given the risks in the macro environment today, we are not going to be doing that in the near term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Monica Tepes, Westhouse Securities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If I could ask 2 questions, please.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So first of all, your outlook on realizations and new investments in the short- to medium term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I don't know if you had many companies that maybe are in advanced negotiation of selling and, given market conditions, it all came to a stop.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And, really, what do you expect in terms that's useful, that investors can expect? Good morning, everyone and welcome, again.",2322
18511,"2011m11","My job is very simple and that's just simply to let you know that if the fire alarm goes for any reason, you need to move out from the back please.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And also, if you could, please turn your mobiles and any other devices off that might interfere with the microphones because this morning's presentation is being webcast.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So without further ado, I'd like to introduce Chief Executive Michael Queen.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The chart on Page 34, I think it was -- in Menno's part of the presentation, showed where the value had come from the exited investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wondered whether you had the money multiple for those investments in the IRR.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Daniel Garrod from Barclays here.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Three quick questions for me.",2322
18511,"2011m11","First, I wonder if you can provide a bit more color on the 10% cost reductions that you've outlined for next year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I think you sort of said that, that's combining the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","developed markets, the division of the European ones.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Can you give any more color around sort of headcount reductions, relocations, office closures that is behind that GBP 15 million figure? Second, the improved disclosure on the divisional basis, with the net portfolio return.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I was a little surprised to see that debt management and infrastructure are sort of breakeven on loss-making there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Is that just you haven't sort of yet achieved the sort of size and the proportion of third-party funding that you would like there, and that the returns will improve when, structurally, you can achieve that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And third question is on the sort of provisions element of your unrealized losses, still very low there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Not really ticked up despite the deteriorating economic environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Is your expectation that we will see that sort of increase a little bit over sort of next 6 months or so in that particular element? Just one more quick question.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The headline multiple, I think, was 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","2 EB to EBITDA.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That's before discount.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wondered whether you could say what it is after discount.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just start with the provisions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, I think the provisions are -- they're not exceptional, one way or the other.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's about where we would expect to see.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Clearly, if we see a full meltdown of the Eurozone, that will put significant stress on all companies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So under that environment, we would expect to see provisions increasing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Absent that, and let's assume governments do get their act together and we do see some form stabilization, I wouldn't, in the current environment, expect to see a significant increase in the level of provisioning that we're seeing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There will always be some provisioning, but I don't think it's going to be a dramatic increase on what we've got we got at the moment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So I gave you -- the rate of the top 5 is 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i Infrastructure, I think, is a great performing business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, fundamentally, it does what it says on the 10.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It provides very, very stable, secure return with a high yield component.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's a key part of our infrastructure strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And what we've said in all of our business lines, is we will have a mix of our own balance sheet capital and third-party capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the way in which we do that in, say, private equity, is we raise funds with limited partners.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The way we do that in Infrastructure is we have a listed permanent capital vehicle that we hold a stake in.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it's a fundamental part of our strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we have absolutely no intention of selling that stake or distributing it in specie.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now the shareholder concerned, that raised that, we haven't had the opportunity to speak to them because they didn't raise it with us before going public.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we were in a closed period, so we haven't been able to go back and really understand what their thinking was.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But certainly, as part of this roadshow, we will be having that discussion.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But we've got no intention of selling our stake.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Well, if there are no further questions, thank you very much for coming along today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If you do think of any other questions during the course of the day, Julia and Menno and I will be very happy to answer them.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But thank you very much for coming.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So if I pick up your question, first of all, on the use of forecast earnings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Yes, you're right.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That is a big factor in resulting in a contraction for the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as you said, it's 23% of companies are on that basis this time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, there's actually quite a spread of companies, to the extent this trends -- there's a number of U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","companies that are in there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So that's consistent with what we've talked about, the macro environment that we've seen.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If we hadn't included those forecast earnings, so if it was sort of consistent with the way that companies are valued in quoted markets, then we would've seen an overall increase in the earnings used to value the portfolio, between 3% and 4%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it is part of that conservatism that we build into our strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, to the extent of what do I expect that to do over the next 6 months, it's quite difficult to predict.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean clearly, when we're doing our valuations -- we did those in September.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We were taking account of as much management information that we had at that time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The March process will have the benefits of including final accounts and the budgets for the following year, and so we will see where that ends up.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As Michael has said, we're operating in pretty tough economic conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So I would expect to see that same -- at least a similar sort of forecast earnings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just a few questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Some of these are quite short.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wondered what the pro forma gearing is, because obviously you've had the MWM proceeds since the year end.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Has there been any big investments to offset that? Philip Middleton from Merrill.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just a couple of things.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Firstly, I wonder if you could update us a little bit more about your external fund raising programs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I realize that now is a difficult time, but maybe over the next 12 months, where you're looking to raise external funds.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And secondly, given what's happening in the private equity industry, obviously, you're shaping your business to that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What do you think happens to the competitive dynamics over the next 2 or 3 years, and how does that play to what you've done? I think it's comparable to kind of the 10-year track record IRRs that was referred to, that's in the back of that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If I pick up the net portfolio return question, yes, you're right.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There are different factors happening for both divisions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If you look at Debt Management, I would say that absolutely is in sort of a -- not quite a startup phase, but we're in the early development of that strategic initiative.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the amount of capital that we have invested there is actually only GBP 18 million at the moment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it's extremely sensitive to any changes in the numbers that we have there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In the period that we've seen, the gross portfolio return for Debt Management was negative as we had some mark-to-market movements on the equity investments that we have there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And given the low level of capital that we have at work, things like the GBP 2 million of acquisition accounting adjustments actually have quite a significant impact.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It would be very, very easy to actually produce a completely stellar return for Debt Management, given that amount of capital we've got at the moment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So very much look at that in terms of early days of strategic development.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But the trajectory for us, in terms of the model that we expect to have, is enhancement from our gross portfolio return, to our net portfolio return, to get an overall 15% return.",2322
18511,"2011m11","For Infrastructure, there are 1 or 2 particular things that play in the 6-month period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, overall, the business is performing extremely well.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The gross portfolio return has got the quoted impact of the Adani Power shares that I've talked about.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And a little bit complicated to understand, but because we expect to manage more third-party money than our own money, in contrast to private equity, if you have a negative gross portfolio return, there is a reversal in the carry accrual that actually ends up being a cost.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So you've got a knock-on effect to that gross portfolio and impact.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Overall, we expect that the Infrastructure business, which has performed very well, as you can see reflected in the confidence of our own Infrastructure plc share price, to absolutely deliver the 15% that we're looking for.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of where we're seeing particular trends, I mean, there are some obvious macroeconomic trends that you can see.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So the Northern European companies have tended to outperform U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","and Southern European.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Those companies, irrespective of their geography, that have a high export component to what they do, particularly to Asia and South America, have outperformed typically domestic businesses.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So all of those obvious macro trends are evident.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms -- in your point about information, we certainly wouldn't want to deprive anybody of information we provided before.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And if you look in your pack, Pages 34 and 35, do give the vintage year performance of both the buyouts and growth portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So hopefully, you will see there that, that information is there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And you can see -- track the trends in that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What we are seeing in terms of growth and buyout assets, the growth -- at an operating level, there is no discernible trend between the 2 portfolios.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But clearly, given that the buyout assets tend to be more highly levered, where they're seeing pressure on earnings, that will have a greater impact on value than it would do for an equivalent growth company, which would be lowly levered.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we probably don't have the exact numbers to hand to you, Chris, but we can always, say, pick that up with you afterwards.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, we certainly have flagged today that we expect the environment for realizations, over the next 6 to 12 months, to be particularly challenging.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As Menno outlined, the activity level, both realizations and new investments in private equity is back at the 2003, 2004 level.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You could even see that actually falling back further than that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It really does depend on how the Eurozone crisis impacts on the banking market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Right now, the banks are closed for business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So that will have an impact, both on the ability to fund new investments and also on other people's ability to buy investments in our portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we have had, in the last 6 months, one process where we backed out of it because the funding climate had got more challenging.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as I said in my statement, we were very fortunate.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We got most of the realizations of this period in the early part of the period when the markets were pretty much functional.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we are anticipating a slower period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Given the sheer scale of our portfolio, there will always be some level of churn, and we do have some visibility on some realizations coming through.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But we are flagging it's going to be a difficult environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the other side of that means that we're going to be highly selective in investment, making sure we're only paying the right value for businesses and making sure that, that value reflects the uncertainties in the market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I've got a couple of questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The first one is on earnings and I'm surprised that the magnitude of the GBP 52 million negative due to weaker earnings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You're obviously using 23% of the portfolio, your volume.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That's on a forward earnings basis.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I was wondering if you could just give us a bit more color on whether that's sector-specific, geographic-specific.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And do you expect the trend to deteriorate over the next 6 months? The other question is just on the -- the old sort of breakdown we used to get of growth and buyout with no loss there, or all being lumped together as private equity.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But can you just give us a bit of a feel for how the growth portfolio performed and how the buyout portfolio performed overall? Okay.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me answer the question on fund raising first.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, the fund that we are out on the road with at the moment is in our India Infrastructure Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That's a successor vehicle to the first fund, which has been very successful.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As I said, we expect that, that will be closed at some point during 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The Debt Management business, we would hope, would be able to launch a number of different products.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Debt Management fundraising has been very, very challenging for 3 or 4 years, really since the start of the financial crisis, though we are seeing now desire for yield.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And our Debt Management business can certainly provide that, in investing in good corporate credit in a relatively lowly or even unlevered way.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So there's a demand for that product.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of private equity fund raising, I mentioned in my statement, we've come to the end of our -- or virtually the end of our Eurofund V investment period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We won't be able to go out on the road and raise a new private equity fund, though, until we finish investing our Growth Capital Fund, because what we said is our next European private equity or developed markets private equity fund will be a combined growth and buyout fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So as soon as we've finished investing, or as we get towards the end of that investment period in Growth Capital, which is the end of 2012, we will then look to raise another private equity fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of what the market environment is, there are 2 aspects to that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","One is the fundraising environment, which I think is as tough as I've ever known it.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I think quite a lot of people, or quite a lot of limited partners, the investors in funds, are taking a very long time to consider new propositions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There is a record number of funds, both from North America and Europe, on the road at the moment, and fund raisings are taking an incredible length of time, between 20 months and 24 months on the road for a typical fund raising.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So an extraordinary length of time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as you saw from Menno's chart earlier, a relatively small amount of capital is actually being raised in new funds.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So this is a tough environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","How does that impact on us? Well, actually, it plays to 3i's advantage to a certain extent, because we are one of the few players in our industry with the benefit of permanent capital -- not just at the 3i Group level, but through 3i Infrastructure plc as well.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we certainly intend to be in the market, making good investments, notwithstanding all the things I've said about how cautious we are.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But it does mean that we can be in the market effectively, doing good deals, and we're not going to be on the road in the next 12 months.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As Michael has said, our returns for the 6 months of 30 September reflect the market conditions in a period of considerable political, economic, and financial uncertainty and volatility.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We are not immune to that, seeing its effect in evaluation of our portfolio and of our pension fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, our balance sheet means that we're able to withstand these headwinds from a position of strength.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This slide shows you the key elements of our returns.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The gross portfolio return reflects the returns generated by our direct investments in the portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net portfolio return reflects the financial impact of running our asset management business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And finally, total return includes the financial effects of our balance sheet.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I will take you through each of these components in more detail in the next few slides.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as I do so, you'll see some new disclosure regarding the performance of our business lines.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Having confirmed our model for returns in May, we're now reporting net portfolio returns by business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In addition, I'll also provide you some detail on our valuations in the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our private equity business will always be the most significant component of our gross portfolio return, as our business model assumes that we'll allocate a much more significant proportion of our own capital to private equity than either infrastructure or debt management.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The private equity returns include GBP 25 million of realized profits on gross proceeds of GBP 523 million, which had lower uplifts than normal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, this is due to the timing, with the significant proportion of the value being reflected in uplifts to sale as at the 31 March 2011.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The top 5 disposals were all at very good money multiples, ranging from 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The net GBP 414 million of unrealized write-downs reflect a deterioration in market multiples and some contraction in the earnings that we use for valuations.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And I'll come on to talk about this in more detail shortly.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The gross portfolio return in our infrastructure business principally comprises the quoted movement and dividend income from our 35% stake in 3i Infrastructure plc, offset by unrealized value movements on investments in our Indian Infrastructure Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Through our infrastructure share price has performed very well in the last 6 months, increasing by 3% to 121p at the 30th of September, and offsetting some currency-led value declines in the Indian portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We increased our investments in through our Infrastructure plc by GBP 33 million, exercising the warrants that we received when the company was first listed.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As expected, Debt Management has minimal effect at the gross portfolio return level, as we've invested only 1% of the capital at work in this business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We'd expect this to grow in importance as we invest in new funds, such as the recently announced Credit Opportunities Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Turning then to the valuation of the portfolio, which gives rise to the GBP 441 million negative movements in the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Clearly, market conditions have deteriorated significantly and rapidly since I spoke to you in May.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And our portfolio is not immune to the effects of that, directly in terms of multiples but also in some cases, in performance.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm going to comment on earnings and multiples in more detail shortly, so I'm just going to use this slide to talk about a couple of the other components.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Impairments of GBP 66 million relate to a number of asset, and are a function of the earnings multiple movements that I'm going to describe.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Provisions are low at GBP 43 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The uplift to imminent sale relates to the disposal of MWM.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You may recall that we announced this disposal last year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm pleased to say that we have received proceeds of GBP 197 million at the start of November.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Finally, the movements on the quoted portfolio, which now accounts for 15% of the total, relates to our residual holding in NORMA, which is a business that IPO-ed in April, as well as our 3i Infrastructure plc shares and Adani Power.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As expected, stock market declines in the period flowed through to the multiples that we use to value the portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The overall fall was 8%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On the face of it, this is lower than headline falls in, say, the FTSE 100 of 13%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, it is in line with the movements in the underlying sectors and the geographies in which we have invested.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You can see here the portfolio diversification.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So for example, we have limited exposure in European financials, which had a significant impact on total market movements, and our value exposure to consumer is much more heavily weighted to Asia.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The weighted average EBITDA multiple fell to 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","8x at the 31st of March.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We talk about earnings growth in 2 ways.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Firstly, in explaining the movements and earnings that we use for valuation purposes; and secondly, for considering the performance of the portfolio as a whole.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So looking first at the earnings that we use for valuation purposes, which results in a negative GBP 52 million unrealized value movement.",2322
18511,"2011m11","64% of the portfolio is valued on an earnings basis.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we calculate the movement on those companies that were valued in this way at the start and at the end of the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our valuation policy is to use the last 12 months' management accounts up to the preceding quarter, so in this case, to the 30th of June.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But if it is apparent that the current year forecast, in other words to the 31st of December, is showing reducing earnings, then we anticipate that decline and use those forecasts.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The number of companies in this position has increased in this period to 23%, reflecting the market conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as a result, the earnings used for valuation purposes showed a contraction of 1%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Looking at earnings as a whole, in aggregate, the earnings in our private equity portfolio grew by 1% in the 6 months, but the weighted average growth in earnings was 8%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It is in that context that we believe the portfolio performance has been solid despite the tough economic conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And this slide shows you some new disclosure about earnings performance of the private equity portfolio, breaking down the last 12 months of earnings performance by value and number of companies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This slide then shows you the effects of those valuations on the total portfolio value.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We began the period with a portfolio of GBP 3.",2322
18511,"2011m11","9 billion, investments of GBP 448 million was measured, and Menno will talk in more detail about some of the new investments in private equity.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Taking account of unrealized losses, divestments and FX, the portfolio value at the end of the period was reduced to GBP 3.",2322
18511,"2011m11","For the first time, we're providing a breakdown of our net portfolio return by business line.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As you'll recall, we set our 15% targets for each of private equity, infrastructure and debt management, on our bridge over 5 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We believe providing this framework allows for a more detailed discussion about the drivers of performance, how we allocate our capital, and how new strategic initiatives are assessed.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So taking each business in turn.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Private equities performance is driven by its gross portfolio return, but the cross-cycle target is 20%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We are a significant balance sheet investor here, 82% of our portfolio and 64% of the private equity assets under management.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And so we expect there to be a dilution from gross to net returns.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Therefore, in a period where market conditions have had a marked effect on the gross portfolio returns, the business will not achieve its 15% target.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Its return is a negative 11%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Fee income in the period is in line with expectations and reflects fees from Eurofunds IV and V, as well as the Growth Capital Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net carry is a positive, as it reflects the reversal of previous accruals following the reduction in portfolio valuing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Over time, we expect net carry to be a cost as we pay carry on total investments but received carry only on the third-party money that we manage.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The cost of GBP 74 million  include the new Brazil team and are flat year-on-year, including this additional resource.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In infrastructure, we have said we expect to be managing 75% third-party money and 25% of our own capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As of the 30th of September, this ratio was 69:31, reflecting our additional investment of GBP 33 million in the period for 3i Infrastructure plc.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As a result, we expect lower gross returns for this business to be enhanced by fees and carry more than covering costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We still expect this to be the case in the longer term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Today, 3i capital represents only 1% of the assets under management in Debt Management, although our aim is to invest 10% capital in this business line.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Consequently, we expect fee income to be the most significant driver of this business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Fees for the period are ahead of our expectations as performance has improved in the funds that we acquired at the end of last year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Cost of the business include acquisition accounting adjustments of GBP 2 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So bringing together the performance of all our businesses into the group's returns, let me comment on a few aspects of total return.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Total operating expenses for the period were GBP 98 million, which include GBP 8 million relating to Brazil and the new debt management team.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Importantly, after taking account of fee income, our net expenses reduced from GBP 59 million to GBP 55 million, as the fees from the Debt Management business more than covered its additional costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net interest payable reduced to GBP 52 million, as we reduced gross debt following the maturity of the remainder of the convertible bond, other planned maturities, and the repurchase of EUR 95 million of the June 2012 FRN.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The actuarial loss of GBP 49 million relates mainly to our U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","defined benefits team and reflects a combination of factors.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The market has  again had an impact, with the value of assets in the scheme and the discount rate used to value the liabilities both falling.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In addition, we have now agreed the latest triennial funding valuation with the scheme's trustees.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have agreed some additional funding contributions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","GBP 60 million of this was paid in September and a further amount, which is expected to be about GBP 36 million, will be paid in April 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The accounting for this is not straightforward, but the actuarial loss reflects the effect of both payments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also agreed a contingent asset arrangement with the trustees without any cash or strategic cost to the group, allowing flexibility to proceed with the de-risking investment strategy for the fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","NAV was 294p at the 30th of September, falling from 351p at the 31st of March.",2322
18511,"2011m11","35p was attributable to the fall in portfolio value, 5p to the actuarial loss of the pension, and the remainder due to operating and interest costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have continued to adopt a conservative balance sheet strategy throughout the period, reducing gross debt and managing our cash requirements carefully.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We hold high levels of liquidity to ensure that we can meet our fund commitments, the ongoing funding requirements of the portfolio, our debt maturities, and to take advantage of investment opportunities where appropriate.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This is particularly important in these economic conditions when our ability to refinance debt may be more constrained or more costly and realizations are more uncertain.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You can see from this slide that we finished the period of investment assets of GBP 3.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4 billion and gross debt of GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net debt was more or less unchanged at GBP 531 million and remains within the GBP 1 billion net debt limit that we've set ourselves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Gearing has increased to 19% as a result of the fall in the portfolio value.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Liquidity remains strong at GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7 billion and is made up of cash at GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","2 billion, and undrawn committed facilities of GBP 0.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our gross debt has fallen from GBP 2 billion to GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7 billion as debt has matured.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have successfully continued in our strategy of extending term and reducing absolute maturities in any one year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We noted in June that we had refinanced our principal revolving credit facility, extending the maturities to June 2016, increasing the amount from GBP 300 million to GBP 450 million, and significantly reducing the costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm pleased to confirm that we have now also extended the 2012 bilateral facility, also to 2016, and have reduced its amount from GBP 100 million to GBP 50 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Before handing over to Menno, I wanted to elaborate further on Michael's comments regarding changes we've announced to our distribution policy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Subject of course to shareholder approval, we have today announced our intention to pay a dividend for the year of 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7p being declared as an interim dividend today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The cash cost of the dividend is GBP 77 million, which is about the level of cash cost before the rights issue in 2009.",2322
18511,"2011m11","A proportion of this dividend will be funded out of capital profits, but we've looked at the long-term average of our realization levels and are comfortable that it is sustainable at this level.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As the asset management part of our business grows, we expect the dividend to be funded out of those revenue profits.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So to conclude.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our returns for the 6 months of 30 September reflect the market conditions in a period of considerable financial uncertainty and volatility.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We are not immune to that, seeing its affecting the valuation of our portfolio and our pension fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In this market, the most important thing we can do is manage the business cautiously and conservatively, taking steps to increase our margin of safety wherever we can.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have continued to do this throughout the period, meaning we were able to withstand the economic headwinds from a position of strength.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'd now like to hand over to Menno.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So to be clear, my comments around using capital profits was to acknowledge that if you look at our cash flow in any one year at the moment, then clearly there's an element of funding dividend out of capital cash flows.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of the reserves that we will use to pay the dividend, for now, until the new investment trust rules come into operation, then we will be using our revenue reserve.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There is ample in the revenue reserve, taking account of the dividend that we've announced today and assuming no further revenue profits generated, then we have at least 2 years' cover in our revenue reserve.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But we are absolutely expecting the changes to come through by the next financial period, which will give us much greater flexibility in terms of our ability to pay out of our reserves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Thanks, Menno.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Before we move to Q&A, I want to conclude with some key messages.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Clearly, we continue to operate in a difficult economic environment, and while the steps that we've taken to strengthen the business are very evident, we're certainly not immune to market turmoil and volatility.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Concerns over excessive levels of sovereign debt taken on by many Western governments, combined with political turbulence and de-leveraging pressures on the banking system, are likely to lead to increased risk and lower growth, particularly in Europe.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This means that now, more than ever, we need to manage the business with a greater margin of safety than we would do under more stable economic conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Having said that, the actions we've taken have put us in a strong position to withstand this environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our recent investments are performing well, which reflects our renewed focus on investment discipline and effective asset management.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also significantly de-levered our investments, particularly in the more highly geared buyout portfolio to give them greater headroom in these uncertain times.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we've reduced our own operating expenses by 1/3 over the past 3 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's actually 40%, if you include the Debt Management acquisition.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And in addition, we expect these to fall by about a further 10% next year, as a result of the changes we have announced today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Finally, the board has announced a significantly re-based dividend and progressive dividend distribution policy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This is a sign of the confidence in the long-term delivery of our strategy and a recognition of the progress that we made to-date.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Together, these actions have put us in good shape to face a tough market with confidence.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In respect of our portfolio companies, we will continue to provide support and challenge to ensure that they not only weather the economic conditions but they come out the other side in a stronger position, ready to seize the opportunities that a recovery will bring.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Today, we're looking forward to the next stage in our private equity business's development.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Together with the opportunities we're pursuing in infrastructure and debt management, we are well-positioned to deliver on our strategy and maximize value for shareholders for the long term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We're now happy to take questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If -- actually, what you could do, if could put your hand up and wait for the microphone, because the questions are being webcast as well.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Gentlemen? And the final question really was about dividend reserve, or revenue reserves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wonder whether you can say a bit about that and to what extent you'd be able to finance the dividend, going forward, from revenue reserves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You implied you'd be happy to use a bit of capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wondered, technically, what the reserve position was.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And in terms of your cost question, I mean, fundamentally, we are a people business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So if we're looking at a 10% cost reduction next year, that really flows through to a 10% headcount fall.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So most of the costs are there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Why can we deliver that? Well, fundamentally, over time, the sheer volume of our portfolio has been falling.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's a more concentrated portfolio than even 2 or 3 years ago, and that creates the opportunity for managing things in a slightly more efficient way.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We're continually looking at the way that -- how our processes work, not just in terms of investment processes, but all our back office processes.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we're able to  continually improve systems.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it's a combination of things, continually looking at all aspects of the business -- in other words, doing to ourselves what we do to each of our portfolio companies, in terms of driving efficiency out of the business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the chart you showed on Page 34, looking at the breakdown of returns between multiple, expansion, growth, et cetera.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Do you have those sort of aggregates, money multiple and IRR for those exited investments? If I pick up the net portfolio return question, yes, you're right.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There are different factors happening for both divisions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If you look at Debt Management, I would say that absolutely is in sort of a -- not quite a startup phase, but we're in the early development of that strategic initiative.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the amount of capital that we have invested there is actually only GBP 18 million at the moment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it's extremely sensitive to any changes in the numbers that we have there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In the period that we've seen, the gross portfolio return for Debt Management was negative as we had some mark-to-market movements on the equity investments that we have there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And given the low level of capital that we have at work, things like the GBP 2 million of acquisition accounting adjustments actually have quite a significant impact.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It would be very, very easy to actually produce a completely stellar return for Debt Management, given that amount of capital we've got at the moment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So very much look at that in terms of early days of strategic development.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But the trajectory for us, in terms of the model that we expect to have, is enhancement from our gross portfolio return, to our net portfolio return, to get an overall 15% return.",2322
18511,"2011m11","For Infrastructure, there are 1 or 2 particular things that play in the 6-month period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, overall, the business is performing extremely well.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The gross portfolio return has got the quoted impact of the Adani Power shares that I've talked about.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And a little bit complicated to understand, but because we expect to manage more third-party money than our own money, in contrast to private equity, if you have a negative gross portfolio return, there is a reversal in the carry accrual that actually ends up being a cost.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So you've got a knock-on effect to that gross portfolio and impact.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Overall, we expect that the Infrastructure business, which has performed very well, as you can see reflected in the confidence of our own Infrastructure plc share price, to absolutely deliver the 15% that we're looking for.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, we certainly have flagged today that we expect the environment for realizations, over the next 6 to 12 months, to be particularly challenging.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As Menno outlined, the activity level, both realizations and new investments in private equity is back at the 2003, 2004 level.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You could even see that actually falling back further than that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It really does depend on how the Eurozone crisis impacts on the banking market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Right now, the banks are closed for business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So that will have an impact, both on the ability to fund new investments and also on other people's ability to buy investments in our portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we have had, in the last 6 months, one process where we backed out of it because the funding climate had got more challenging.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as I said in my statement, we were very fortunate.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We got most of the realizations of this period in the early part of the period when the markets were pretty much functional.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we are anticipating a slower period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Given the sheer scale of our portfolio, there will always be some level of churn, and we do have some visibility on some realizations coming through.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But we are flagging it's going to be a difficult environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the other side of that means that we're going to be highly selective in investment, making sure we're only paying the right value for businesses and making sure that, that value reflects the uncertainties in the market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Well, the board has considered whether it's appropriate to conduct buybacks in the current market and felt that, given the uncertainties around refinancing and our need to continue to roll over certain parts of our gross borrowings, that it was just too uncertain an environment to embark on that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What we also need to do is to make sure that we continue to meet our fiduciary responsibilities in respect to the funds that we manage.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We raise these funds and we charge fees on the basis that we will invest in assets over a given timeframe.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And it's very important that we continue to do that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And clearly, 3i's investment in those assets, it's important to meet that because we intend to continue to raise funds going forward.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So while mathematically, if the shares trade at a discount to net assets, it's unassailable logic that buying those shares on that basis would boost the NAV per share.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's not necessarily in the long-term interest of shareholders for us to do that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And that's what the board has taken into account in coming out with a decision today, that in the current time we would not undertake buybacks.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now that's not to say that, that will be the position forever.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We don't have a principled objection to buybacks.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We absolutely see buybacks as an appropriate form of the cycle.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But given the risks in the macro environment today, we are not going to be doing that in the near term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So to be clear, my comments around using capital profits was to acknowledge that if you look at our cash flow in any one year at the moment, then clearly there's an element of funding dividend out of capital cash flows.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of the reserves that we will use to pay the dividend, for now, until the new investment trust rules come into operation, then we will be using our revenue reserve.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There is ample in the revenue reserve, taking account of the dividend that we've announced today and assuming no further revenue profits generated, then we have at least 2 years' cover in our revenue reserve.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But we are absolutely expecting the changes to come through by the next financial period, which will give us much greater flexibility in terms of our ability to pay out of our reserves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we've announced the investment in Etanco, which wasn't invested in the 30th of September.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So my pro forma net debt is about GBP 100 million better than the number at 30th of September.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I've got a couple of questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The first one is on earnings and I'm surprised that the magnitude of the GBP 52 million negative due to weaker earnings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You're obviously using 23% of the portfolio, your volume.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That's on a forward earnings basis.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I was wondering if you could just give us a bit more color on whether that's sector-specific, geographic-specific.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And do you expect the trend to deteriorate over the next 6 months? The other question is just on the -- the old sort of breakdown we used to get of growth and buyout with no loss there, or all being lumped together as private equity.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But can you just give us a bit of a feel for how the growth portfolio performed and how the buyout portfolio performed overall? Just one more quick question.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The headline multiple, I think, was 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","2 EB to EBITDA.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That's before discount.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wondered whether you could say what it is after discount.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Monica Tepes, Westhouse Securities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If I could ask 2 questions, please.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So first of all, your outlook on realizations and new investments in the short- to medium term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I don't know if you had many companies that maybe are in advanced negotiation of selling and, given market conditions, it all came to a stop.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And, really, what do you expect in terms that's useful, that investors can expect? In terms of where we're seeing particular trends, I mean, there are some obvious macroeconomic trends that you can see.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So the Northern European companies have tended to outperform U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","and Southern European.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Those companies, irrespective of their geography, that have a high export component to what they do, particularly to Asia and South America, have outperformed typically domestic businesses.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So all of those obvious macro trends are evident.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms -- in your point about information, we certainly wouldn't want to deprive anybody of information we provided before.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And if you look in your pack, Pages 34 and 35, do give the vintage year performance of both the buyouts and growth portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So hopefully, you will see there that, that information is there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And you can see -- track the trends in that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What we are seeing in terms of growth and buyout assets, the growth -- at an operating level, there is no discernible trend between the 2 portfolios.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But clearly, given that the buyout assets tend to be more highly levered, where they're seeing pressure on earnings, that will have a greater impact on value than it would do for an equivalent growth company, which would be lowly levered.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The chart on Page 34, I think it was -- in Menno's part of the presentation, showed where the value had come from the exited investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wondered whether you had the money multiple for those investments in the IRR.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Philip Middleton from Merrill.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just a couple of things.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Firstly, I wonder if you could update us a little bit more about your external fund raising programs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I realize that now is a difficult time, but maybe over the next 12 months, where you're looking to raise external funds.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And secondly, given what's happening in the private equity industry, obviously, you're shaping your business to that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What do you think happens to the competitive dynamics over the next 2 or 3 years, and how does that play to what you've done? Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As Michael has said, our returns for the 6 months of 30 September reflect the market conditions in a period of considerable political, economic, and financial uncertainty and volatility.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We are not immune to that, seeing its effect in evaluation of our portfolio and of our pension fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, our balance sheet means that we're able to withstand these headwinds from a position of strength.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This slide shows you the key elements of our returns.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The gross portfolio return reflects the returns generated by our direct investments in the portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net portfolio return reflects the financial impact of running our asset management business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And finally, total return includes the financial effects of our balance sheet.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I will take you through each of these components in more detail in the next few slides.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as I do so, you'll see some new disclosure regarding the performance of our business lines.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Having confirmed our model for returns in May, we're now reporting net portfolio returns by business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In addition, I'll also provide you some detail on our valuations in the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our private equity business will always be the most significant component of our gross portfolio return, as our business model assumes that we'll allocate a much more significant proportion of our own capital to private equity than either infrastructure or debt management.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The private equity returns include GBP 25 million of realized profits on gross proceeds of GBP 523 million, which had lower uplifts than normal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, this is due to the timing, with the significant proportion of the value being reflected in uplifts to sale as at the 31 March 2011.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The top 5 disposals were all at very good money multiples, ranging from 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The net GBP 414 million of unrealized write-downs reflect a deterioration in market multiples and some contraction in the earnings that we use for valuations.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And I'll come on to talk about this in more detail shortly.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The gross portfolio return in our infrastructure business principally comprises the quoted movement and dividend income from our 35% stake in 3i Infrastructure plc, offset by unrealized value movements on investments in our Indian Infrastructure Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Through our infrastructure share price has performed very well in the last 6 months, increasing by 3% to 121p at the 30th of September, and offsetting some currency-led value declines in the Indian portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We increased our investments in through our Infrastructure plc by GBP 33 million, exercising the warrants that we received when the company was first listed.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As expected, Debt Management has minimal effect at the gross portfolio return level, as we've invested only 1% of the capital at work in this business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We'd expect this to grow in importance as we invest in new funds, such as the recently announced Credit Opportunities Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Turning then to the valuation of the portfolio, which gives rise to the GBP 441 million negative movements in the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Clearly, market conditions have deteriorated significantly and rapidly since I spoke to you in May.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And our portfolio is not immune to the effects of that, directly in terms of multiples but also in some cases, in performance.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm going to comment on earnings and multiples in more detail shortly, so I'm just going to use this slide to talk about a couple of the other components.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Impairments of GBP 66 million relate to a number of asset, and are a function of the earnings multiple movements that I'm going to describe.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Provisions are low at GBP 43 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The uplift to imminent sale relates to the disposal of MWM.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You may recall that we announced this disposal last year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm pleased to say that we have received proceeds of GBP 197 million at the start of November.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Finally, the movements on the quoted portfolio, which now accounts for 15% of the total, relates to our residual holding in NORMA, which is a business that IPO-ed in April, as well as our 3i Infrastructure plc shares and Adani Power.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As expected, stock market declines in the period flowed through to the multiples that we use to value the portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The overall fall was 8%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On the face of it, this is lower than headline falls in, say, the FTSE 100 of 13%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, it is in line with the movements in the underlying sectors and the geographies in which we have invested.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You can see here the portfolio diversification.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So for example, we have limited exposure in European financials, which had a significant impact on total market movements, and our value exposure to consumer is much more heavily weighted to Asia.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The weighted average EBITDA multiple fell to 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","8x at the 31st of March.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We talk about earnings growth in 2 ways.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Firstly, in explaining the movements and earnings that we use for valuation purposes; and secondly, for considering the performance of the portfolio as a whole.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So looking first at the earnings that we use for valuation purposes, which results in a negative GBP 52 million unrealized value movement.",2322
18511,"2011m11","64% of the portfolio is valued on an earnings basis.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we calculate the movement on those companies that were valued in this way at the start and at the end of the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our valuation policy is to use the last 12 months' management accounts up to the preceding quarter, so in this case, to the 30th of June.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But if it is apparent that the current year forecast, in other words to the 31st of December, is showing reducing earnings, then we anticipate that decline and use those forecasts.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The number of companies in this position has increased in this period to 23%, reflecting the market conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as a result, the earnings used for valuation purposes showed a contraction of 1%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Looking at earnings as a whole, in aggregate, the earnings in our private equity portfolio grew by 1% in the 6 months, but the weighted average growth in earnings was 8%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It is in that context that we believe the portfolio performance has been solid despite the tough economic conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And this slide shows you some new disclosure about earnings performance of the private equity portfolio, breaking down the last 12 months of earnings performance by value and number of companies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This slide then shows you the effects of those valuations on the total portfolio value.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We began the period with a portfolio of GBP 3.",2322
18511,"2011m11","9 billion, investments of GBP 448 million was measured, and Menno will talk in more detail about some of the new investments in private equity.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Taking account of unrealized losses, divestments and FX, the portfolio value at the end of the period was reduced to GBP 3.",2322
18511,"2011m11","For the first time, we're providing a breakdown of our net portfolio return by business line.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As you'll recall, we set our 15% targets for each of private equity, infrastructure and debt management, on our bridge over 5 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We believe providing this framework allows for a more detailed discussion about the drivers of performance, how we allocate our capital, and how new strategic initiatives are assessed.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So taking each business in turn.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Private equities performance is driven by its gross portfolio return, but the cross-cycle target is 20%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We are a significant balance sheet investor here, 82% of our portfolio and 64% of the private equity assets under management.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And so we expect there to be a dilution from gross to net returns.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Therefore, in a period where market conditions have had a marked effect on the gross portfolio returns, the business will not achieve its 15% target.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Its return is a negative 11%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Fee income in the period is in line with expectations and reflects fees from Eurofunds IV and V, as well as the Growth Capital Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net carry is a positive, as it reflects the reversal of previous accruals following the reduction in portfolio valuing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Over time, we expect net carry to be a cost as we pay carry on total investments but received carry only on the third-party money that we manage.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The cost of GBP 74 million  include the new Brazil team and are flat year-on-year, including this additional resource.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In infrastructure, we have said we expect to be managing 75% third-party money and 25% of our own capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As of the 30th of September, this ratio was 69:31, reflecting our additional investment of GBP 33 million in the period for 3i Infrastructure plc.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As a result, we expect lower gross returns for this business to be enhanced by fees and carry more than covering costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We still expect this to be the case in the longer term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Today, 3i capital represents only 1% of the assets under management in Debt Management, although our aim is to invest 10% capital in this business line.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Consequently, we expect fee income to be the most significant driver of this business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Fees for the period are ahead of our expectations as performance has improved in the funds that we acquired at the end of last year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Cost of the business include acquisition accounting adjustments of GBP 2 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So bringing together the performance of all our businesses into the group's returns, let me comment on a few aspects of total return.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Total operating expenses for the period were GBP 98 million, which include GBP 8 million relating to Brazil and the new debt management team.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Importantly, after taking account of fee income, our net expenses reduced from GBP 59 million to GBP 55 million, as the fees from the Debt Management business more than covered its additional costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net interest payable reduced to GBP 52 million, as we reduced gross debt following the maturity of the remainder of the convertible bond, other planned maturities, and the repurchase of EUR 95 million of the June 2012 FRN.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The actuarial loss of GBP 49 million relates mainly to our U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","defined benefits team and reflects a combination of factors.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The market has  again had an impact, with the value of assets in the scheme and the discount rate used to value the liabilities both falling.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In addition, we have now agreed the latest triennial funding valuation with the scheme's trustees.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have agreed some additional funding contributions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","GBP 60 million of this was paid in September and a further amount, which is expected to be about GBP 36 million, will be paid in April 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The accounting for this is not straightforward, but the actuarial loss reflects the effect of both payments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also agreed a contingent asset arrangement with the trustees without any cash or strategic cost to the group, allowing flexibility to proceed with the de-risking investment strategy for the fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","NAV was 294p at the 30th of September, falling from 351p at the 31st of March.",2322
18511,"2011m11","35p was attributable to the fall in portfolio value, 5p to the actuarial loss of the pension, and the remainder due to operating and interest costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have continued to adopt a conservative balance sheet strategy throughout the period, reducing gross debt and managing our cash requirements carefully.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We hold high levels of liquidity to ensure that we can meet our fund commitments, the ongoing funding requirements of the portfolio, our debt maturities, and to take advantage of investment opportunities where appropriate.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This is particularly important in these economic conditions when our ability to refinance debt may be more constrained or more costly and realizations are more uncertain.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You can see from this slide that we finished the period of investment assets of GBP 3.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4 billion and gross debt of GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net debt was more or less unchanged at GBP 531 million and remains within the GBP 1 billion net debt limit that we've set ourselves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Gearing has increased to 19% as a result of the fall in the portfolio value.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Liquidity remains strong at GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7 billion and is made up of cash at GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","2 billion, and undrawn committed facilities of GBP 0.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our gross debt has fallen from GBP 2 billion to GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7 billion as debt has matured.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have successfully continued in our strategy of extending term and reducing absolute maturities in any one year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We noted in June that we had refinanced our principal revolving credit facility, extending the maturities to June 2016, increasing the amount from GBP 300 million to GBP 450 million, and significantly reducing the costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm pleased to confirm that we have now also extended the 2012 bilateral facility, also to 2016, and have reduced its amount from GBP 100 million to GBP 50 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Before handing over to Menno, I wanted to elaborate further on Michael's comments regarding changes we've announced to our distribution policy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Subject of course to shareholder approval, we have today announced our intention to pay a dividend for the year of 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7p being declared as an interim dividend today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The cash cost of the dividend is GBP 77 million, which is about the level of cash cost before the rights issue in 2009.",2322
18511,"2011m11","A proportion of this dividend will be funded out of capital profits, but we've looked at the long-term average of our realization levels and are comfortable that it is sustainable at this level.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As the asset management part of our business grows, we expect the dividend to be funded out of those revenue profits.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So to conclude.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our returns for the 6 months of 30 September reflect the market conditions in a period of considerable financial uncertainty and volatility.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We are not immune to that, seeing its affecting the valuation of our portfolio and our pension fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In this market, the most important thing we can do is manage the business cautiously and conservatively, taking steps to increase our margin of safety wherever we can.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have continued to do this throughout the period, meaning we were able to withstand the economic headwinds from a position of strength.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'd now like to hand over to Menno.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i Infrastructure, I think, is a great performing business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, fundamentally, it does what it says on the 10.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It provides very, very stable, secure return with a high yield component.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's a key part of our infrastructure strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And what we've said in all of our business lines, is we will have a mix of our own balance sheet capital and third-party capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the way in which we do that in, say, private equity, is we raise funds with limited partners.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The way we do that in Infrastructure is we have a listed permanent capital vehicle that we hold a stake in.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it's a fundamental part of our strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we have absolutely no intention of selling that stake or distributing it in specie.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now the shareholder concerned, that raised that, we haven't had the opportunity to speak to them because they didn't raise it with us before going public.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we were in a closed period, so we haven't been able to go back and really understand what their thinking was.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But certainly, as part of this roadshow, we will be having that discussion.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But we've got no intention of selling our stake.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Well, if there are no further questions, thank you very much for coming along today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If you do think of any other questions during the course of the day, Julia and Menno and I will be very happy to answer them.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But thank you very much for coming.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the chart you showed on Page 34, looking at the breakdown of returns between multiple, expansion, growth, et cetera.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Do you have those sort of aggregates, money multiple and IRR for those exited investments? So we probably don't have the exact numbers to hand to you, Chris, but we can always, say, pick that up with you afterwards.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Daniel Garrod from Barclays here.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Three quick questions for me.",2322
18511,"2011m11","First, I wonder if you can provide a bit more color on the 10% cost reductions that you've outlined for next year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I think you sort of said that, that's combining the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","developed markets, the division of the European ones.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Can you give any more color around sort of headcount reductions, relocations, office closures that is behind that GBP 15 million figure? Second, the improved disclosure on the divisional basis, with the net portfolio return.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I was a little surprised to see that debt management and infrastructure are sort of breakeven on loss-making there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Is that just you haven't sort of yet achieved the sort of size and the proportion of third-party funding that you would like there, and that the returns will improve when, structurally, you can achieve that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And third question is on the sort of provisions element of your unrealized losses, still very low there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Not really ticked up despite the deteriorating economic environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Is your expectation that we will see that sort of increase a little bit over sort of next 6 months or so in that particular element? And the final question really was about dividend reserve, or revenue reserves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wonder whether you can say a bit about that and to what extent you'd be able to finance the dividend, going forward, from revenue reserves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You implied you'd be happy to use a bit of capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wondered, technically, what the reserve position was.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just start with the provisions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, I think the provisions are -- they're not exceptional, one way or the other.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's about where we would expect to see.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Clearly, if we see a full meltdown of the Eurozone, that will put significant stress on all companies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So under that environment, we would expect to see provisions increasing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Absent that, and let's assume governments do get their act together and we do see some form stabilization, I wouldn't, in the current environment, expect to see a significant increase in the level of provisioning that we're seeing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There will always be some provisioning, but I don't think it's going to be a dramatic increase on what we've got we got at the moment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I think it's comparable to kind of the 10-year track record IRRs that was referred to, that's in the back of that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So I gave you -- the rate of the top 5 is 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Henry Freeman from Liberum Capital again.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just following on from your comments on 3i Infrastructure and the success of that business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I understand that one of your investors has quite publicly called for a distribution of the holding.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Are you, first of all, considering this? Secondly, would you consider just a straightforward placing of that quite considerable stake in 3i Infrastructure? And obviously, this is with regards to the significant discount at which 3i Group trades at, while 3i Infrastructure actually trades pretty well to now.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me answer the question on fund raising first.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, the fund that we are out on the road with at the moment is in our India Infrastructure Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That's a successor vehicle to the first fund, which has been very successful.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As I said, we expect that, that will be closed at some point during 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The Debt Management business, we would hope, would be able to launch a number of different products.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Debt Management fundraising has been very, very challenging for 3 or 4 years, really since the start of the financial crisis, though we are seeing now desire for yield.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And our Debt Management business can certainly provide that, in investing in good corporate credit in a relatively lowly or even unlevered way.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So there's a demand for that product.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of private equity fund raising, I mentioned in my statement, we've come to the end of our -- or virtually the end of our Eurofund V investment period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We won't be able to go out on the road and raise a new private equity fund, though, until we finish investing our Growth Capital Fund, because what we said is our next European private equity or developed markets private equity fund will be a combined growth and buyout fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So as soon as we've finished investing, or as we get towards the end of that investment period in Growth Capital, which is the end of 2012, we will then look to raise another private equity fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of what the market environment is, there are 2 aspects to that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","One is the fundraising environment, which I think is as tough as I've ever known it.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I think quite a lot of people, or quite a lot of limited partners, the investors in funds, are taking a very long time to consider new propositions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There is a record number of funds, both from North America and Europe, on the road at the moment, and fund raisings are taking an incredible length of time, between 20 months and 24 months on the road for a typical fund raising.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So an extraordinary length of time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as you saw from Menno's chart earlier, a relatively small amount of capital is actually being raised in new funds.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So this is a tough environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","How does that impact on us? Well, actually, it plays to 3i's advantage to a certain extent, because we are one of the few players in our industry with the benefit of permanent capital -- not just at the 3i Group level, but through 3i Infrastructure plc as well.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we certainly intend to be in the market, making good investments, notwithstanding all the things I've said about how cautious we are.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But it does mean that we can be in the market effectively, doing good deals, and we're not going to be on the road in the next 12 months.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hi, this is Henry Freeman from Liberum Capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm interested in your standpoint on buybacks and also the confidence in the current value of the portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Surely, the opportunities that you're seeing -- the new investment opportunities you're seeing must have quite a significant hurdle, in excess of 30%, if buybacks are still not seen as a better investment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Thanks, Menno.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Before we move to Q&A, I want to conclude with some key messages.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Clearly, we continue to operate in a difficult economic environment, and while the steps that we've taken to strengthen the business are very evident, we're certainly not immune to market turmoil and volatility.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Concerns over excessive levels of sovereign debt taken on by many Western governments, combined with political turbulence and de-leveraging pressures on the banking system, are likely to lead to increased risk and lower growth, particularly in Europe.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This means that now, more than ever, we need to manage the business with a greater margin of safety than we would do under more stable economic conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Having said that, the actions we've taken have put us in a strong position to withstand this environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our recent investments are performing well, which reflects our renewed focus on investment discipline and effective asset management.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also significantly de-levered our investments, particularly in the more highly geared buyout portfolio to give them greater headroom in these uncertain times.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we've reduced our own operating expenses by 1/3 over the past 3 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's actually 40%, if you include the Debt Management acquisition.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And in addition, we expect these to fall by about a further 10% next year, as a result of the changes we have announced today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Finally, the board has announced a significantly re-based dividend and progressive dividend distribution policy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This is a sign of the confidence in the long-term delivery of our strategy and a recognition of the progress that we made to-date.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Together, these actions have put us in good shape to face a tough market with confidence.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In respect of our portfolio companies, we will continue to provide support and challenge to ensure that they not only weather the economic conditions but they come out the other side in a stronger position, ready to seize the opportunities that a recovery will bring.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Today, we're looking forward to the next stage in our private equity business's development.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Together with the opportunities we're pursuing in infrastructure and debt management, we are well-positioned to deliver on our strategy and maximize value for shareholders for the long term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We're now happy to take questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If -- actually, what you could do, if could put your hand up and wait for the microphone, because the questions are being webcast as well.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Gentlemen? Well, good morning, everyone.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me take you through the agenda for today's briefing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm going to start by giving an overview of the group performance, as well as more detail on the private equity changes that we've announced this morning, and the result of the board's dividend policy review.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Julia will follow with the detailed financial results.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'll then ask Menno Antal to give a bit more color on how the private equity business line is performing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Finally, I'll return to say a few words on the outlook before we open the floor to questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There's no doubt that the last 6 months have presented an extremely difficult operating environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","For financial markets, it's been a period of considerable uncertainty, and fears regarding the future of the Eurozone have severely damaged business confidence in many of our markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i has not been immune to this turmoil, and as you'll see in more detail as Julia takes you through the financials, our half year performance has been significantly affected by the macroeconomic environment, particularly the impact of falling stock markets on multiples.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We can take some comfort in the underlying performance of our investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On a value-weighted basis, our portfolio earnings have increased 8% in the 6 months, with our more valuable investments tending to be the better performers throughout the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, as I've raised repeatedly through these presentations, our performance has continued to be impacted by the high prices paid and high leverage of assets invested in 2007 and 2008.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On the macroeconomic level, parallels can be drawn between what we're going through now and the first stage of the financial crisis in 2008.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, from a 3i Group perspective, there's a marked contrast between then and now.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The steps we've taken to strengthen our balance sheet were a precaution against exactly the kind of market conditions we're seeing today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also significantly reduced the leverage at the portfolio level.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As an example, the average debt multiple in our buyout portfolio now stands at 4.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4x, down from almost 6x, which gives greater headroom to cope with any temporary fluctuations in performance.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've reduced net debt at the 3i Group level too, from a peak of GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","9 billion  in 2009 to just over GBP 0.",2322
18511,"2011m11","5 billion today, giving us a stronger position as we enter an increasingly uncertain period for realizations in refinancings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The quality of our asset management and investment capabilities has also been strengthened as evidenced by the performance of recent new investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The teams are very focused on maintaining their investment discipline and managing the portfolio to maximize value.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Another area where we've changed 3i is the cost base.",2322
18511,"2011m11","By adjusting our operational and financial structure, and maintaining a focus on our core competencies, we've reduced operating expenses by 1/3 over the past 3 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Last year, we announced the combination of our European growth and buyout teams to form a single European private equity team.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As we reach the end of the Eurofund V investment period, we are now further reshaping this combined business to reflect the current market condition and the likely new investment environment over the next few years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In addition, we're integrating our U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","team to create a developed markets private equity team.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This will allow operating efficiencies to be achieved, which in turn, enables a reduction of operating expenses by at least GBP 15 million a year from financial year 2012-13.",2322
18511,"2011m11","These steps reflect the natural progression of our private equity business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The team will be well positioned to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities as they arise and will have the full support of the 3i balance sheet.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In developing markets private equity, we strengthened our China team with the appointment of Paul Su.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also received an allocation to invest in local currency from the Chinese government.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And in Brazil, we've established an advisory board to support the local team in São Paulo.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The changes in the private equity business also require some changes to the leadership team and a realignment of leadership roles.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As we've already announced, Simon Borrows has joined as Chief Investment Officer, while his predecessor, Ian Nolan, is leaving 3i.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Menno Antal and Alan Giddins will jointly lead our developed markets private equity business, covering Europe and the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11",", and Guy Zarzavatdjian will take over responsibility for developing markets in addition to his current responsibility for the Growth Capital Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Bob Stefanowski will step down from the leadership team to focus on 2 of our larger portfolio companies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In our Infrastructure and Debt Management business lines, performance has been robust, and we're pursuing a number of initiatives.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The European infrastructure assets have performed well, and during the period, 3i Infrastructure's consortium was announced as a preferred bidder on the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","'s Thameslink rail project.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In India, we've launched the second India Infrastructure Fund, which we expect to complete during 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In debt management, the CLO funds are performing ahead of our original business plan, generating good advisory and performance fees.",2322
18511,"2011m11","During this period, we've launched a new Credit Opportunities Fund, initially funded by 3i, which will aim to take advantage of the dislocation that we see in credit markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I now want to turn towards our current priorities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i's first priority is to maximize the value of our existing investments by supporting them through current economic conditions so that they're well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities that will follow.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We're also focused on maintaining investment discipline across our business lines.",2322
18511,"2011m11","All the deals we do must be reviewed in the light of constantly changing economic conditions, and we need to ensure that we pay the right price at the right time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's also vitally important that we continue with the conservative balance sheet strategy we followed since 2009.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Doing so will give greater security to all our stakeholders in this uncertain environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","A key part of our strategy is to grow the business in a measured way.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Some good examples of this are the second Indian infrastructure fund raising and the Credit Opportunities Fund that I've already mentioned.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Together, these priorities feed into the delivery of our strategic model, and allow us to provide shareholders with more stable and consistent returns over the economic cycle.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now having introduced our model for returns in May and completed our review of the European private equity business, the board has now decided the appropriate proportion of those returns that should take the form of dividend.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm pleased to announce that, subject to shareholder approval, we're raising the full year dividend to 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","1p per share, and this is an increase of 125% on the previous year, of which we're declaring an interim dividend of 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","From this higher base, we expect to grow the dividend progressively, in line with the performance of the business and its balance sheet strength.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The board has also considered undertaking share buybacks and, while accepting the principle of buybacks, has concluded that such purchases are not appropriate at the current time, particularly given the extreme uncertainty in financial markets and low levels of business and consumer confidence.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And now before I pass to Julia, let me give you the key metrics for the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As I've said, our gross return has been primarily driven by market conditions, most notably the decline in multiples used for valuation purposes.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Although as a whole, our investments have displayed resilient underlying performance, the general softening of market conditions has led to a negative gross investment return of 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","After cost and financing, this results in a negative total return of 15.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Despite the tough environment, we achieved a good level of realizations at GBP 532 million, although most of these were in the first half of this 6-month period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Investment during this period was GBP 448 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our gross debt currently stands at GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7 billion, and taking into account our cash balances, we have net debt of GBP 531 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our liquidity, which includes cash and undrawn facilities, is GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Julia will now take you through these numbers, along with the other financials, in more detail.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We don't actually calculate that anymore because we can't get the comparisons, but in terms of the discounts that we apply, they're in a range of 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","5% to about 10%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There are a couple of outliers that have a much more significant discount.",2322
18511,"2011m11","5% discount subsidy applied to companies that are very close to disposal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Typically, we will use 5% in the buyouts portfolio and 10% in the growth capital portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Thank you, Julia, and good morning, everyone.",2322
18511,"2011m11","My name is Menno Antal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm an engineer by education and complemented by an MBA from IMD.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Before joining 3i, I worked for 10 years at Heineken in different international, operational, commercial, and general management roles.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I joined 3i in 2000 to help build the Benelux office in Amsterdam, of which I became a Managing Director in 2003.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In 2009, I took over responsibility for Germany, followed by the Nordic region in 2010.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I also became part of the leadership team in 2010.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What I would like to do in this presentation is to provide a brief update on the European private equity markets and to explain our strategy within these markets, particularly against a market backdrop that continues to present challenges, then to take you through the recent investment activities to demonstrate actually why I believe we will be successful in delivering good returns in the medium term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Through this presentation, I'd also like to give you a clear understanding of the changes of the private equity business as announced by Michael earlier.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me begin with the European private equity markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The investment activities have come off significantly since '07, '08.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Even if the large cap markets has suffered most, the mid-market has also been impacted, and investment levels are now comparable to the years of 2003 and 2004.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In 2010 and first half of 2011, we saw an upward trend in activity levels.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, since the beginning of August, the euro crisis has had a significant impact on the market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The third quarter, to the end of September, is showing a 41% decline in investment activity on the previous quarter.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's our expectation that these conditions will prevail well into 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, there are clear regional differences across the European market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have an excellent investment track record over the past 10 years, in Germany, the Benelux, France and the Nordic region.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i is very well-positioned in these markets and we continue to see attractive investment opportunities, given the quality of the companies that we're seeing, the strength of the management teams, and our ability to help these businesses achieve their international potential.",2322
18511,"2011m11",", we obviously have a very strong position.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In the short term, we expect the current economic conditions to continue in the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11",", and combined with the intense competition we are seeing for good-quality assets, means that we will remain highly selective.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That said, I'm confident that we will find attractive opportunities in this market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The Spanish and Italian markets show even greater challenges.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Making new investments in these markets does not look attractive in the near term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, we have a very good market position in Spain, and a high-quality team to create value from the existing large portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Turning to our strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On the right side of the slides, I've set out our key competitive advantages, and on the left, the deal criteria which are based on these advantages.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our target market is investments with an enterprise value of up to EUR 500 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We consider this to be the mid-market, where local relationships are of high importance, and where companies are focused on international growth, which plays to our strengths.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our key competitive advantage is the global presence that we have, with local offices that are deeply rooted in their respective business communities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I believe this is unique in the European mid-market, particularly when combined with our presence and experience of markets such as India, China, and most recently, Brazil.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our global network helps us to assess the international growth opportunity of a given investment and subsequently determine a strategy to ensure its execution.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Another key advantage is our sector knowledge, and the people and network we've built around the sectors.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This not only makes us proactive in our investment approach, but also the long-term track records that we have built in these sectors provides the opportunity to work with best-in-class chairmen and operators, giving us real credibility with management teams when we are pursuing a deal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As you would expect, and entirely consistent with the private equity investment model, we focus on bringing operational improvements to each of our investments through our Active Partnership program, which is crucial to driving value, particularly in this current environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The case that I'll discuss in a moment will give you a clear sense of what I mean.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But first, let me take you through our recent investment activity.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have made 13 new investments since the rights issue in 2009, to which we have rigorously applied the investment disciplines that I have just described.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In your presentation packs you will find an overview of each of these investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Performance is very promising, with 85% of these companies performing in line or ahead of plan, and we have clear visibility of those companies that are not performing to plan.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Turning to the 3 most recent buyouts, set out on this slide, let me provide some greater detail to demonstrate how we apply our investment criteria to each new investment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","SMT is a European/U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","testing and inspections business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We know this sector well and our cross-Atlantic consolidation strategy plays to our strengths here.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As part of the strategy, we see a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities in both Europe and the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Trading performance is strong with current organic growth of 25%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This now translates into a purchase price of less than 8x 2011 EBITDA, down from 9.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Another recent investment is Action, a Dutch discount retailer we were able to acquire in an off-market transaction from the founders.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We regard the business as noncyclical and highly defensive given its discount offering.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The company has delivered 21% growth on average each of the past 5 years, and we see a continuation of that growth again this year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now you can see that the international booked has not picked.",2322
18511,"2011m11","[ph] And we have indeed not built our base business assumptions on an international rollout.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, despite the strong growth we are seeing in Action's domestic market, we intend to pursue a strategy to internationalize the business, to accelerate growth, and maximize the potential of this investment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me now turn to Hilite in some more detail.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hilite is a classic 3i buyout.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This is a EUR 190 million acquisition of a non-core German subsidiary of a U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","company, through our German and U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We won this deal on the back of our track records in the automotive and engineering sector, based on what we achieved with investment such as MWM, Hyva, and NORMA, all investments which have delivered fabulous returns over the last 12 to 18 months.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hilite is a leading global supplier of fuel efficiency and emissions reductions components, with annual sales of around EUR 300 million, and a very positive sales outlook.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The majority of its sales for the next 4 years have already been contracted.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Management was attracted to 3i's track record in the automotive industry, our ability to further internationalize businesses, along with our active partnership approach to drive further efficiencies from across the business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We regard this as one of the most exciting segments of the automotive industry.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hilite is the innovation leader, and we see real potential to grow the business internationally, particularly in China.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Since the investment, we've been able to strengthen management, bringing the former chairman of NORMA and former executives from Siemens and GE to the company.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now based on current performance, we completed the deal at 5.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4x 2011 EBITDA, which makes it very attractively priced.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Many of you will be familiar with the following, which sets out our private equity track record over the last 10 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The total equity value at exit the state of net realized losses, I believe that our recent investment -- apologies for that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I therefore believe that this is a good proxy for the track record of the private equity business, despite the impact of performance of  recent vintages.",2322
18511,"2011m11","An enormous amount of work has been done to mitigate portfolio risk.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have reinforced our investment procedures, financial risk and government processes to apply realistic investment parameters that recognize current operating environment in which we are investing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also reduced the leverage across the buyout portfolio from around 6x EBITDA to 4.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4x, with over 85% of the portfolio not having any maturities due before 2014.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The further changes that we are bringing to our business today, built on the initiatives we have implemented under Michael's leadership, these changes will strengthen our position for both today's and tomorrow's markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In summary, with the changes that we have made to the team over the past year, including today, we have in place a high-quality team, which is determined to succeed and to deliver really good returns.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I believe our recent investments demonstrate that even in the current markets, we are able to find exciting investment opportunities, with significant growth strategies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I would now like to hand back to Michael.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Good morning, everyone and welcome, again.",2322
18511,"2011m11","My job is very simple and that's just simply to let you know that if the fire alarm goes for any reason, you need to move out from the back please.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And also, if you could, please turn your mobiles and any other devices off that might interfere with the microphones because this morning's presentation is being webcast.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So without further ado, I'd like to introduce Chief Executive Michael Queen.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just a few questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Some of these are quite short.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wondered what the pro forma gearing is, because obviously you've had the MWM proceeds since the year end.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Has there been any big investments to offset that? And in terms of your cost question, I mean, fundamentally, we are a people business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So if we're looking at a 10% cost reduction next year, that really flows through to a 10% headcount fall.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So most of the costs are there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Why can we deliver that? Well, fundamentally, over time, the sheer volume of our portfolio has been falling.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's a more concentrated portfolio than even 2 or 3 years ago, and that creates the opportunity for managing things in a slightly more efficient way.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We're continually looking at the way that -- how our processes work, not just in terms of investment processes, but all our back office processes.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we're able to  continually improve systems.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it's a combination of things, continually looking at all aspects of the business -- in other words, doing to ourselves what we do to each of our portfolio companies, in terms of driving efficiency out of the business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So if I pick up your question, first of all, on the use of forecast earnings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Yes, you're right.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That is a big factor in resulting in a contraction for the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as you said, it's 23% of companies are on that basis this time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, there's actually quite a spread of companies, to the extent this trends -- there's a number of U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","companies that are in there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So that's consistent with what we've talked about, the macro environment that we've seen.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If we hadn't included those forecast earnings, so if it was sort of consistent with the way that companies are valued in quoted markets, then we would've seen an overall increase in the earnings used to value the portfolio, between 3% and 4%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it is part of that conservatism that we build into our strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, to the extent of what do I expect that to do over the next 6 months, it's quite difficult to predict.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean clearly, when we're doing our valuations -- we did those in September.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We were taking account of as much management information that we had at that time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The March process will have the benefits of including final accounts and the budgets for the following year, and so we will see where that ends up.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As Michael has said, we're operating in pretty tough economic conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So I would expect to see that same -- at least a similar sort of forecast earnings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of where we're seeing particular trends, I mean, there are some obvious macroeconomic trends that you can see.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So the Northern European companies have tended to outperform U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","and Southern European.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Those companies, irrespective of their geography, that have a high export component to what they do, particularly to Asia and South America, have outperformed typically domestic businesses.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So all of those obvious macro trends are evident.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms -- in your point about information, we certainly wouldn't want to deprive anybody of information we provided before.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And if you look in your pack, Pages 34 and 35, do give the vintage year performance of both the buyouts and growth portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So hopefully, you will see there that, that information is there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And you can see -- track the trends in that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What we are seeing in terms of growth and buyout assets, the growth -- at an operating level, there is no discernible trend between the 2 portfolios.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But clearly, given that the buyout assets tend to be more highly levered, where they're seeing pressure on earnings, that will have a greater impact on value than it would do for an equivalent growth company, which would be lowly levered.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So if I pick up your question, first of all, on the use of forecast earnings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Yes, you're right.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That is a big factor in resulting in a contraction for the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as you said, it's 23% of companies are on that basis this time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, there's actually quite a spread of companies, to the extent this trends -- there's a number of U.",2322

18511,"2011m11","So that's consistent with what we've talked about, the macro environment that we've seen.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If we hadn't included those forecast earnings, so if it was sort of consistent with the way that companies are valued in quoted markets, then we would've seen an overall increase in the earnings used to value the portfolio, between 3% and 4%.",2322

18511,"2011m11","As Michael has said, we're operating in pretty tough economic conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So I would expect to see that same -- at least a similar sort of forecast earnings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Thanks, Menno.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Before we move to Q&A, I want to conclude with some key messages.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Clearly, we continue to operate in a difficult economic environment, and while the steps that we've taken to strengthen the business are very evident, we're certainly not immune to market turmoil and volatility.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Concerns over excessive levels of sovereign debt taken on by many Western governments, combined with political turbulence and de-leveraging pressures on the banking system, are likely to lead to increased risk and lower growth, particularly in Europe.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This means that now, more than ever, we need to manage the business with a greater margin of safety than we would do under more stable economic conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Having said that, the actions we've taken have put us in a strong position to withstand this environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our recent investments are performing well, which reflects our renewed focus on investment discipline and effective asset management.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also significantly de-levered our investments, particularly in the more highly geared buyout portfolio to give them greater headroom in these uncertain times.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we've reduced our own operating expenses by 1/3 over the past 3 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's actually 40%, if you include the Debt Management acquisition.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And in addition, we expect these to fall by about a further 10% next year, as a result of the changes we have announced today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Finally, the board has announced a significantly re-based dividend and progressive dividend distribution policy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This is a sign of the confidence in the long-term delivery of our strategy and a recognition of the progress that we made to-date.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Together, these actions have put us in good shape to face a tough market with confidence.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In respect of our portfolio companies, we will continue to provide support and challenge to ensure that they not only weather the economic conditions but they come out the other side in a stronger position, ready to seize the opportunities that a recovery will bring.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Today, we're looking forward to the next stage in our private equity business's development.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Together with the opportunities we're pursuing in infrastructure and debt management, we are well-positioned to deliver on our strategy and maximize value for shareholders for the long term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We're now happy to take questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If -- actually, what you could do, if could put your hand up and wait for the microphone, because the questions are being webcast as well.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Gentlemen? Daniel Garrod from Barclays here.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Three quick questions for me.",2322
18511,"2011m11","First, I wonder if you can provide a bit more color on the 10% cost reductions that you've outlined for next year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I think you sort of said that, that's combining the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","developed markets, the division of the European ones.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Can you give any more color around sort of headcount reductions, relocations, office closures that is behind that GBP 15 million figure? Second, the improved disclosure on the divisional basis, with the net portfolio return.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I was a little surprised to see that debt management and infrastructure are sort of breakeven on loss-making there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Is that just you haven't sort of yet achieved the sort of size and the proportion of third-party funding that you would like there, and that the returns will improve when, structurally, you can achieve that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And third question is on the sort of provisions element of your unrealized losses, still very low there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Not really ticked up despite the deteriorating economic environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Is your expectation that we will see that sort of increase a little bit over sort of next 6 months or so in that particular element? I think it's comparable to kind of the 10-year track record IRRs that was referred to, that's in the back of that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hi, this is Henry Freeman from Liberum Capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm interested in your standpoint on buybacks and also the confidence in the current value of the portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Surely, the opportunities that you're seeing -- the new investment opportunities you're seeing must have quite a significant hurdle, in excess of 30%, if buybacks are still not seen as a better investment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the chart you showed on Page 34, looking at the breakdown of returns between multiple, expansion, growth, et cetera.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Do you have those sort of aggregates, money multiple and IRR for those exited investments? We don't actually calculate that anymore because we can't get the comparisons, but in terms of the discounts that we apply, they're in a range of 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","5% to about 10%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There are a couple of outliers that have a much more significant discount.",2322
18511,"2011m11","5% discount subsidy applied to companies that are very close to disposal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Typically, we will use 5% in the buyouts portfolio and 10% in the growth capital portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we've announced the investment in Etanco, which wasn't invested in the 30th of September.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So my pro forma net debt is about GBP 100 million better than the number at 30th of September.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Philip Middleton from Merrill.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just a couple of things.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Firstly, I wonder if you could update us a little bit more about your external fund raising programs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I realize that now is a difficult time, but maybe over the next 12 months, where you're looking to raise external funds.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And secondly, given what's happening in the private equity industry, obviously, you're shaping your business to that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What do you think happens to the competitive dynamics over the next 2 or 3 years, and how does that play to what you've done? Okay.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me answer the question on fund raising first.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, the fund that we are out on the road with at the moment is in our India Infrastructure Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That's a successor vehicle to the first fund, which has been very successful.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As I said, we expect that, that will be closed at some point during 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The Debt Management business, we would hope, would be able to launch a number of different products.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Debt Management fundraising has been very, very challenging for 3 or 4 years, really since the start of the financial crisis, though we are seeing now desire for yield.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And our Debt Management business can certainly provide that, in investing in good corporate credit in a relatively lowly or even unlevered way.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So there's a demand for that product.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of private equity fund raising, I mentioned in my statement, we've come to the end of our -- or virtually the end of our Eurofund V investment period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We won't be able to go out on the road and raise a new private equity fund, though, until we finish investing our Growth Capital Fund, because what we said is our next European private equity or developed markets private equity fund will be a combined growth and buyout fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So as soon as we've finished investing, or as we get towards the end of that investment period in Growth Capital, which is the end of 2012, we will then look to raise another private equity fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of what the market environment is, there are 2 aspects to that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","One is the fundraising environment, which I think is as tough as I've ever known it.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I think quite a lot of people, or quite a lot of limited partners, the investors in funds, are taking a very long time to consider new propositions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There is a record number of funds, both from North America and Europe, on the road at the moment, and fund raisings are taking an incredible length of time, between 20 months and 24 months on the road for a typical fund raising.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So an extraordinary length of time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as you saw from Menno's chart earlier, a relatively small amount of capital is actually being raised in new funds.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So this is a tough environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","How does that impact on us? Well, actually, it plays to 3i's advantage to a certain extent, because we are one of the few players in our industry with the benefit of permanent capital -- not just at the 3i Group level, but through 3i Infrastructure plc as well.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we certainly intend to be in the market, making good investments, notwithstanding all the things I've said about how cautious we are.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But it does mean that we can be in the market effectively, doing good deals, and we're not going to be on the road in the next 12 months.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And in terms of your cost question, I mean, fundamentally, we are a people business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So if we're looking at a 10% cost reduction next year, that really flows through to a 10% headcount fall.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So most of the costs are there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Why can we deliver that? Well, fundamentally, over time, the sheer volume of our portfolio has been falling.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's a more concentrated portfolio than even 2 or 3 years ago, and that creates the opportunity for managing things in a slightly more efficient way.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We're continually looking at the way that -- how our processes work, not just in terms of investment processes, but all our back office processes.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we're able to  continually improve systems.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it's a combination of things, continually looking at all aspects of the business -- in other words, doing to ourselves what we do to each of our portfolio companies, in terms of driving efficiency out of the business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Monica Tepes, Westhouse Securities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If I could ask 2 questions, please.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So first of all, your outlook on realizations and new investments in the short- to medium term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I don't know if you had many companies that maybe are in advanced negotiation of selling and, given market conditions, it all came to a stop.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And, really, what do you expect in terms that's useful, that investors can expect? Just one more quick question.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The headline multiple, I think, was 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","2 EB to EBITDA.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That's before discount.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wondered whether you could say what it is after discount.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the final question really was about dividend reserve, or revenue reserves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wonder whether you can say a bit about that and to what extent you'd be able to finance the dividend, going forward, from revenue reserves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You implied you'd be happy to use a bit of capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wondered, technically, what the reserve position was.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we probably don't have the exact numbers to hand to you, Chris, but we can always, say, pick that up with you afterwards.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As Michael has said, our returns for the 6 months of 30 September reflect the market conditions in a period of considerable political, economic, and financial uncertainty and volatility.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We are not immune to that, seeing its effect in evaluation of our portfolio and of our pension fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, our balance sheet means that we're able to withstand these headwinds from a position of strength.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This slide shows you the key elements of our returns.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The gross portfolio return reflects the returns generated by our direct investments in the portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net portfolio return reflects the financial impact of running our asset management business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And finally, total return includes the financial effects of our balance sheet.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I will take you through each of these components in more detail in the next few slides.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as I do so, you'll see some new disclosure regarding the performance of our business lines.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Having confirmed our model for returns in May, we're now reporting net portfolio returns by business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In addition, I'll also provide you some detail on our valuations in the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our private equity business will always be the most significant component of our gross portfolio return, as our business model assumes that we'll allocate a much more significant proportion of our own capital to private equity than either infrastructure or debt management.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The private equity returns include GBP 25 million of realized profits on gross proceeds of GBP 523 million, which had lower uplifts than normal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, this is due to the timing, with the significant proportion of the value being reflected in uplifts to sale as at the 31 March 2011.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The top 5 disposals were all at very good money multiples, ranging from 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The net GBP 414 million of unrealized write-downs reflect a deterioration in market multiples and some contraction in the earnings that we use for valuations.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And I'll come on to talk about this in more detail shortly.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The gross portfolio return in our infrastructure business principally comprises the quoted movement and dividend income from our 35% stake in 3i Infrastructure plc, offset by unrealized value movements on investments in our Indian Infrastructure Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Through our infrastructure share price has performed very well in the last 6 months, increasing by 3% to 121p at the 30th of September, and offsetting some currency-led value declines in the Indian portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We increased our investments in through our Infrastructure plc by GBP 33 million, exercising the warrants that we received when the company was first listed.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As expected, Debt Management has minimal effect at the gross portfolio return level, as we've invested only 1% of the capital at work in this business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We'd expect this to grow in importance as we invest in new funds, such as the recently announced Credit Opportunities Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Turning then to the valuation of the portfolio, which gives rise to the GBP 441 million negative movements in the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Clearly, market conditions have deteriorated significantly and rapidly since I spoke to you in May.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And our portfolio is not immune to the effects of that, directly in terms of multiples but also in some cases, in performance.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm going to comment on earnings and multiples in more detail shortly, so I'm just going to use this slide to talk about a couple of the other components.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Impairments of GBP 66 million relate to a number of asset, and are a function of the earnings multiple movements that I'm going to describe.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Provisions are low at GBP 43 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The uplift to imminent sale relates to the disposal of MWM.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You may recall that we announced this disposal last year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm pleased to say that we have received proceeds of GBP 197 million at the start of November.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Finally, the movements on the quoted portfolio, which now accounts for 15% of the total, relates to our residual holding in NORMA, which is a business that IPO-ed in April, as well as our 3i Infrastructure plc shares and Adani Power.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As expected, stock market declines in the period flowed through to the multiples that we use to value the portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The overall fall was 8%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On the face of it, this is lower than headline falls in, say, the FTSE 100 of 13%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, it is in line with the movements in the underlying sectors and the geographies in which we have invested.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You can see here the portfolio diversification.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So for example, we have limited exposure in European financials, which had a significant impact on total market movements, and our value exposure to consumer is much more heavily weighted to Asia.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The weighted average EBITDA multiple fell to 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","8x at the 31st of March.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We talk about earnings growth in 2 ways.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Firstly, in explaining the movements and earnings that we use for valuation purposes; and secondly, for considering the performance of the portfolio as a whole.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So looking first at the earnings that we use for valuation purposes, which results in a negative GBP 52 million unrealized value movement.",2322
18511,"2011m11","64% of the portfolio is valued on an earnings basis.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we calculate the movement on those companies that were valued in this way at the start and at the end of the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our valuation policy is to use the last 12 months' management accounts up to the preceding quarter, so in this case, to the 30th of June.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But if it is apparent that the current year forecast, in other words to the 31st of December, is showing reducing earnings, then we anticipate that decline and use those forecasts.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The number of companies in this position has increased in this period to 23%, reflecting the market conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as a result, the earnings used for valuation purposes showed a contraction of 1%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Looking at earnings as a whole, in aggregate, the earnings in our private equity portfolio grew by 1% in the 6 months, but the weighted average growth in earnings was 8%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It is in that context that we believe the portfolio performance has been solid despite the tough economic conditions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And this slide shows you some new disclosure about earnings performance of the private equity portfolio, breaking down the last 12 months of earnings performance by value and number of companies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This slide then shows you the effects of those valuations on the total portfolio value.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We began the period with a portfolio of GBP 3.",2322
18511,"2011m11","9 billion, investments of GBP 448 million was measured, and Menno will talk in more detail about some of the new investments in private equity.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Taking account of unrealized losses, divestments and FX, the portfolio value at the end of the period was reduced to GBP 3.",2322
18511,"2011m11","For the first time, we're providing a breakdown of our net portfolio return by business line.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As you'll recall, we set our 15% targets for each of private equity, infrastructure and debt management, on our bridge over 5 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We believe providing this framework allows for a more detailed discussion about the drivers of performance, how we allocate our capital, and how new strategic initiatives are assessed.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So taking each business in turn.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Private equities performance is driven by its gross portfolio return, but the cross-cycle target is 20%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We are a significant balance sheet investor here, 82% of our portfolio and 64% of the private equity assets under management.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And so we expect there to be a dilution from gross to net returns.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Therefore, in a period where market conditions have had a marked effect on the gross portfolio returns, the business will not achieve its 15% target.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Its return is a negative 11%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Fee income in the period is in line with expectations and reflects fees from Eurofunds IV and V, as well as the Growth Capital Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net carry is a positive, as it reflects the reversal of previous accruals following the reduction in portfolio valuing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Over time, we expect net carry to be a cost as we pay carry on total investments but received carry only on the third-party money that we manage.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The cost of GBP 74 million  include the new Brazil team and are flat year-on-year, including this additional resource.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In infrastructure, we have said we expect to be managing 75% third-party money and 25% of our own capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As of the 30th of September, this ratio was 69:31, reflecting our additional investment of GBP 33 million in the period for 3i Infrastructure plc.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As a result, we expect lower gross returns for this business to be enhanced by fees and carry more than covering costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We still expect this to be the case in the longer term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Today, 3i capital represents only 1% of the assets under management in Debt Management, although our aim is to invest 10% capital in this business line.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Consequently, we expect fee income to be the most significant driver of this business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Fees for the period are ahead of our expectations as performance has improved in the funds that we acquired at the end of last year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Cost of the business include acquisition accounting adjustments of GBP 2 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So bringing together the performance of all our businesses into the group's returns, let me comment on a few aspects of total return.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Total operating expenses for the period were GBP 98 million, which include GBP 8 million relating to Brazil and the new debt management team.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Importantly, after taking account of fee income, our net expenses reduced from GBP 59 million to GBP 55 million, as the fees from the Debt Management business more than covered its additional costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net interest payable reduced to GBP 52 million, as we reduced gross debt following the maturity of the remainder of the convertible bond, other planned maturities, and the repurchase of EUR 95 million of the June 2012 FRN.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The actuarial loss of GBP 49 million relates mainly to our U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","defined benefits team and reflects a combination of factors.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The market has  again had an impact, with the value of assets in the scheme and the discount rate used to value the liabilities both falling.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In addition, we have now agreed the latest triennial funding valuation with the scheme's trustees.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have agreed some additional funding contributions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","GBP 60 million of this was paid in September and a further amount, which is expected to be about GBP 36 million, will be paid in April 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The accounting for this is not straightforward, but the actuarial loss reflects the effect of both payments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also agreed a contingent asset arrangement with the trustees without any cash or strategic cost to the group, allowing flexibility to proceed with the de-risking investment strategy for the fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","NAV was 294p at the 30th of September, falling from 351p at the 31st of March.",2322
18511,"2011m11","35p was attributable to the fall in portfolio value, 5p to the actuarial loss of the pension, and the remainder due to operating and interest costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have continued to adopt a conservative balance sheet strategy throughout the period, reducing gross debt and managing our cash requirements carefully.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We hold high levels of liquidity to ensure that we can meet our fund commitments, the ongoing funding requirements of the portfolio, our debt maturities, and to take advantage of investment opportunities where appropriate.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This is particularly important in these economic conditions when our ability to refinance debt may be more constrained or more costly and realizations are more uncertain.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You can see from this slide that we finished the period of investment assets of GBP 3.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4 billion and gross debt of GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Net debt was more or less unchanged at GBP 531 million and remains within the GBP 1 billion net debt limit that we've set ourselves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Gearing has increased to 19% as a result of the fall in the portfolio value.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Liquidity remains strong at GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7 billion and is made up of cash at GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","2 billion, and undrawn committed facilities of GBP 0.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our gross debt has fallen from GBP 2 billion to GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7 billion as debt has matured.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have successfully continued in our strategy of extending term and reducing absolute maturities in any one year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We noted in June that we had refinanced our principal revolving credit facility, extending the maturities to June 2016, increasing the amount from GBP 300 million to GBP 450 million, and significantly reducing the costs.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm pleased to confirm that we have now also extended the 2012 bilateral facility, also to 2016, and have reduced its amount from GBP 100 million to GBP 50 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Before handing over to Menno, I wanted to elaborate further on Michael's comments regarding changes we've announced to our distribution policy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Subject of course to shareholder approval, we have today announced our intention to pay a dividend for the year of 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7p being declared as an interim dividend today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The cash cost of the dividend is GBP 77 million, which is about the level of cash cost before the rights issue in 2009.",2322
18511,"2011m11","A proportion of this dividend will be funded out of capital profits, but we've looked at the long-term average of our realization levels and are comfortable that it is sustainable at this level.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As the asset management part of our business grows, we expect the dividend to be funded out of those revenue profits.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So to conclude.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our returns for the 6 months of 30 September reflect the market conditions in a period of considerable financial uncertainty and volatility.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We are not immune to that, seeing its affecting the valuation of our portfolio and our pension fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In this market, the most important thing we can do is manage the business cautiously and conservatively, taking steps to increase our margin of safety wherever we can.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have continued to do this throughout the period, meaning we were able to withstand the economic headwinds from a position of strength.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'd now like to hand over to Menno.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, we certainly have flagged today that we expect the environment for realizations, over the next 6 to 12 months, to be particularly challenging.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As Menno outlined, the activity level, both realizations and new investments in private equity is back at the 2003, 2004 level.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You could even see that actually falling back further than that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It really does depend on how the Eurozone crisis impacts on the banking market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Right now, the banks are closed for business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So that will have an impact, both on the ability to fund new investments and also on other people's ability to buy investments in our portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we have had, in the last 6 months, one process where we backed out of it because the funding climate had got more challenging.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And as I said in my statement, we were very fortunate.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We got most of the realizations of this period in the early part of the period when the markets were pretty much functional.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we are anticipating a slower period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Given the sheer scale of our portfolio, there will always be some level of churn, and we do have some visibility on some realizations coming through.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But we are flagging it's going to be a difficult environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the other side of that means that we're going to be highly selective in investment, making sure we're only paying the right value for businesses and making sure that, that value reflects the uncertainties in the market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If I pick up the net portfolio return question, yes, you're right.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There are different factors happening for both divisions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If you look at Debt Management, I would say that absolutely is in sort of a -- not quite a startup phase, but we're in the early development of that strategic initiative.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the amount of capital that we have invested there is actually only GBP 18 million at the moment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it's extremely sensitive to any changes in the numbers that we have there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In the period that we've seen, the gross portfolio return for Debt Management was negative as we had some mark-to-market movements on the equity investments that we have there.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And given the low level of capital that we have at work, things like the GBP 2 million of acquisition accounting adjustments actually have quite a significant impact.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It would be very, very easy to actually produce a completely stellar return for Debt Management, given that amount of capital we've got at the moment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So very much look at that in terms of early days of strategic development.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But the trajectory for us, in terms of the model that we expect to have, is enhancement from our gross portfolio return, to our net portfolio return, to get an overall 15% return.",2322
18511,"2011m11","For Infrastructure, there are 1 or 2 particular things that play in the 6-month period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, overall, the business is performing extremely well.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The gross portfolio return has got the quoted impact of the Adani Power shares that I've talked about.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And a little bit complicated to understand, but because we expect to manage more third-party money than our own money, in contrast to private equity, if you have a negative gross portfolio return, there is a reversal in the carry accrual that actually ends up being a cost.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So you've got a knock-on effect to that gross portfolio and impact.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Overall, we expect that the Infrastructure business, which has performed very well, as you can see reflected in the confidence of our own Infrastructure plc share price, to absolutely deliver the 15% that we're looking for.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Thank you, Julia, and good morning, everyone.",2322
18511,"2011m11","My name is Menno Antal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm an engineer by education and complemented by an MBA from IMD.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Before joining 3i, I worked for 10 years at Heineken in different international, operational, commercial, and general management roles.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I joined 3i in 2000 to help build the Benelux office in Amsterdam, of which I became a Managing Director in 2003.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In 2009, I took over responsibility for Germany, followed by the Nordic region in 2010.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I also became part of the leadership team in 2010.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What I would like to do in this presentation is to provide a brief update on the European private equity markets and to explain our strategy within these markets, particularly against a market backdrop that continues to present challenges, then to take you through the recent investment activities to demonstrate actually why I believe we will be successful in delivering good returns in the medium term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Through this presentation, I'd also like to give you a clear understanding of the changes of the private equity business as announced by Michael earlier.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me begin with the European private equity markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The investment activities have come off significantly since '07, '08.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Even if the large cap markets has suffered most, the mid-market has also been impacted, and investment levels are now comparable to the years of 2003 and 2004.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In 2010 and first half of 2011, we saw an upward trend in activity levels.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, since the beginning of August, the euro crisis has had a significant impact on the market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The third quarter, to the end of September, is showing a 41% decline in investment activity on the previous quarter.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's our expectation that these conditions will prevail well into 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, there are clear regional differences across the European market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have an excellent investment track record over the past 10 years, in Germany, the Benelux, France and the Nordic region.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i is very well-positioned in these markets and we continue to see attractive investment opportunities, given the quality of the companies that we're seeing, the strength of the management teams, and our ability to help these businesses achieve their international potential.",2322
18511,"2011m11",", we obviously have a very strong position.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In the short term, we expect the current economic conditions to continue in the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11",", and combined with the intense competition we are seeing for good-quality assets, means that we will remain highly selective.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That said, I'm confident that we will find attractive opportunities in this market.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The Spanish and Italian markets show even greater challenges.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Making new investments in these markets does not look attractive in the near term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, we have a very good market position in Spain, and a high-quality team to create value from the existing large portfolio.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Turning to our strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On the right side of the slides, I've set out our key competitive advantages, and on the left, the deal criteria which are based on these advantages.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our target market is investments with an enterprise value of up to EUR 500 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We consider this to be the mid-market, where local relationships are of high importance, and where companies are focused on international growth, which plays to our strengths.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our key competitive advantage is the global presence that we have, with local offices that are deeply rooted in their respective business communities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I believe this is unique in the European mid-market, particularly when combined with our presence and experience of markets such as India, China, and most recently, Brazil.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our global network helps us to assess the international growth opportunity of a given investment and subsequently determine a strategy to ensure its execution.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Another key advantage is our sector knowledge, and the people and network we've built around the sectors.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This not only makes us proactive in our investment approach, but also the long-term track records that we have built in these sectors provides the opportunity to work with best-in-class chairmen and operators, giving us real credibility with management teams when we are pursuing a deal.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As you would expect, and entirely consistent with the private equity investment model, we focus on bringing operational improvements to each of our investments through our Active Partnership program, which is crucial to driving value, particularly in this current environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The case that I'll discuss in a moment will give you a clear sense of what I mean.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But first, let me take you through our recent investment activity.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have made 13 new investments since the rights issue in 2009, to which we have rigorously applied the investment disciplines that I have just described.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In your presentation packs you will find an overview of each of these investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Performance is very promising, with 85% of these companies performing in line or ahead of plan, and we have clear visibility of those companies that are not performing to plan.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Turning to the 3 most recent buyouts, set out on this slide, let me provide some greater detail to demonstrate how we apply our investment criteria to each new investment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","SMT is a European/U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","testing and inspections business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We know this sector well and our cross-Atlantic consolidation strategy plays to our strengths here.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As part of the strategy, we see a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities in both Europe and the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Trading performance is strong with current organic growth of 25%.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This now translates into a purchase price of less than 8x 2011 EBITDA, down from 9.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Another recent investment is Action, a Dutch discount retailer we were able to acquire in an off-market transaction from the founders.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We regard the business as noncyclical and highly defensive given its discount offering.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The company has delivered 21% growth on average each of the past 5 years, and we see a continuation of that growth again this year.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now you can see that the international booked has not picked.",2322
18511,"2011m11","[ph] And we have indeed not built our base business assumptions on an international rollout.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, despite the strong growth we are seeing in Action's domestic market, we intend to pursue a strategy to internationalize the business, to accelerate growth, and maximize the potential of this investment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me now turn to Hilite in some more detail.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hilite is a classic 3i buyout.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This is a EUR 190 million acquisition of a non-core German subsidiary of a U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","company, through our German and U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We won this deal on the back of our track records in the automotive and engineering sector, based on what we achieved with investment such as MWM, Hyva, and NORMA, all investments which have delivered fabulous returns over the last 12 to 18 months.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hilite is a leading global supplier of fuel efficiency and emissions reductions components, with annual sales of around EUR 300 million, and a very positive sales outlook.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The majority of its sales for the next 4 years have already been contracted.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Management was attracted to 3i's track record in the automotive industry, our ability to further internationalize businesses, along with our active partnership approach to drive further efficiencies from across the business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We regard this as one of the most exciting segments of the automotive industry.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Hilite is the innovation leader, and we see real potential to grow the business internationally, particularly in China.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Since the investment, we've been able to strengthen management, bringing the former chairman of NORMA and former executives from Siemens and GE to the company.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now based on current performance, we completed the deal at 5.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4x 2011 EBITDA, which makes it very attractively priced.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Many of you will be familiar with the following, which sets out our private equity track record over the last 10 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The total equity value at exit the state of net realized losses, I believe that our recent investment -- apologies for that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I therefore believe that this is a good proxy for the track record of the private equity business, despite the impact of performance of  recent vintages.",2322
18511,"2011m11","An enormous amount of work has been done to mitigate portfolio risk.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We have reinforced our investment procedures, financial risk and government processes to apply realistic investment parameters that recognize current operating environment in which we are investing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also reduced the leverage across the buyout portfolio from around 6x EBITDA to 4.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4x, with over 85% of the portfolio not having any maturities due before 2014.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The further changes that we are bringing to our business today, built on the initiatives we have implemented under Michael's leadership, these changes will strengthen our position for both today's and tomorrow's markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In summary, with the changes that we have made to the team over the past year, including today, we have in place a high-quality team, which is determined to succeed and to deliver really good returns.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I believe our recent investments demonstrate that even in the current markets, we are able to find exciting investment opportunities, with significant growth strategies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I would now like to hand back to Michael.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The chart on Page 34, I think it was -- in Menno's part of the presentation, showed where the value had come from the exited investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wondered whether you had the money multiple for those investments in the IRR.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i Infrastructure, I think, is a great performing business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, fundamentally, it does what it says on the 10.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It provides very, very stable, secure return with a high yield component.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's a key part of our infrastructure strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And what we've said in all of our business lines, is we will have a mix of our own balance sheet capital and third-party capital.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And the way in which we do that in, say, private equity, is we raise funds with limited partners.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The way we do that in Infrastructure is we have a listed permanent capital vehicle that we hold a stake in.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So it's a fundamental part of our strategy.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So we have absolutely no intention of selling that stake or distributing it in specie.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now the shareholder concerned, that raised that, we haven't had the opportunity to speak to them because they didn't raise it with us before going public.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And we were in a closed period, so we haven't been able to go back and really understand what their thinking was.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But certainly, as part of this roadshow, we will be having that discussion.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But we've got no intention of selling our stake.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Well, if there are no further questions, thank you very much for coming along today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","If you do think of any other questions during the course of the day, Julia and Menno and I will be very happy to answer them.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But thank you very much for coming.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So to be clear, my comments around using capital profits was to acknowledge that if you look at our cash flow in any one year at the moment, then clearly there's an element of funding dividend out of capital cash flows.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In terms of the reserves that we will use to pay the dividend, for now, until the new investment trust rules come into operation, then we will be using our revenue reserve.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There is ample in the revenue reserve, taking account of the dividend that we've announced today and assuming no further revenue profits generated, then we have at least 2 years' cover in our revenue reserve.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But we are absolutely expecting the changes to come through by the next financial period, which will give us much greater flexibility in terms of our ability to pay out of our reserves.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I've got a couple of questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The first one is on earnings and I'm surprised that the magnitude of the GBP 52 million negative due to weaker earnings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","You're obviously using 23% of the portfolio, your volume.",2322
18511,"2011m11","That's on a forward earnings basis.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I was wondering if you could just give us a bit more color on whether that's sector-specific, geographic-specific.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And do you expect the trend to deteriorate over the next 6 months? The other question is just on the -- the old sort of breakdown we used to get of growth and buyout with no loss there, or all being lumped together as private equity.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But can you just give us a bit of a feel for how the growth portfolio performed and how the buyout portfolio performed overall? So I gave you -- the rate of the top 5 is 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Good morning, everyone and welcome, again.",2322
18511,"2011m11","My job is very simple and that's just simply to let you know that if the fire alarm goes for any reason, you need to move out from the back please.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And also, if you could, please turn your mobiles and any other devices off that might interfere with the microphones because this morning's presentation is being webcast.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So without further ado, I'd like to introduce Chief Executive Michael Queen.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Well, the board has considered whether it's appropriate to conduct buybacks in the current market and felt that, given the uncertainties around refinancing and our need to continue to roll over certain parts of our gross borrowings, that it was just too uncertain an environment to embark on that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","What we also need to do is to make sure that we continue to meet our fiduciary responsibilities in respect to the funds that we manage.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We raise these funds and we charge fees on the basis that we will invest in assets over a given timeframe.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And it's very important that we continue to do that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And clearly, 3i's investment in those assets, it's important to meet that because we intend to continue to raise funds going forward.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So while mathematically, if the shares trade at a discount to net assets, it's unassailable logic that buying those shares on that basis would boost the NAV per share.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's not necessarily in the long-term interest of shareholders for us to do that.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And that's what the board has taken into account in coming out with a decision today, that in the current time we would not undertake buybacks.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now that's not to say that, that will be the position forever.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We don't have a principled objection to buybacks.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We absolutely see buybacks as an appropriate form of the cycle.",2322
18511,"2011m11","But given the risks in the macro environment today, we are not going to be doing that in the near term.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Henry Freeman from Liberum Capital again.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just following on from your comments on 3i Infrastructure and the success of that business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I understand that one of your investors has quite publicly called for a distribution of the holding.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Are you, first of all, considering this? Secondly, would you consider just a straightforward placing of that quite considerable stake in 3i Infrastructure? And obviously, this is with regards to the significant discount at which 3i Group trades at, while 3i Infrastructure actually trades pretty well to now.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just start with the provisions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I mean, I think the provisions are -- they're not exceptional, one way or the other.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's about where we would expect to see.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Clearly, if we see a full meltdown of the Eurozone, that will put significant stress on all companies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","So under that environment, we would expect to see provisions increasing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Absent that, and let's assume governments do get their act together and we do see some form stabilization, I wouldn't, in the current environment, expect to see a significant increase in the level of provisioning that we're seeing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There will always be some provisioning, but I don't think it's going to be a dramatic increase on what we've got we got at the moment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Well, good morning, everyone.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Let me take you through the agenda for today's briefing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm going to start by giving an overview of the group performance, as well as more detail on the private equity changes that we've announced this morning, and the result of the board's dividend policy review.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Julia will follow with the detailed financial results.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'll then ask Menno Antal to give a bit more color on how the private equity business line is performing.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Finally, I'll return to say a few words on the outlook before we open the floor to questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","There's no doubt that the last 6 months have presented an extremely difficult operating environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","For financial markets, it's been a period of considerable uncertainty, and fears regarding the future of the Eurozone have severely damaged business confidence in many of our markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i has not been immune to this turmoil, and as you'll see in more detail as Julia takes you through the financials, our half year performance has been significantly affected by the macroeconomic environment, particularly the impact of falling stock markets on multiples.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We can take some comfort in the underlying performance of our investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On a value-weighted basis, our portfolio earnings have increased 8% in the 6 months, with our more valuable investments tending to be the better performers throughout the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, as I've raised repeatedly through these presentations, our performance has continued to be impacted by the high prices paid and high leverage of assets invested in 2007 and 2008.",2322
18511,"2011m11","On the macroeconomic level, parallels can be drawn between what we're going through now and the first stage of the financial crisis in 2008.",2322
18511,"2011m11","However, from a 3i Group perspective, there's a marked contrast between then and now.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The steps we've taken to strengthen our balance sheet were a precaution against exactly the kind of market conditions we're seeing today.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also significantly reduced the leverage at the portfolio level.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As an example, the average debt multiple in our buyout portfolio now stands at 4.",2322
18511,"2011m11","4x, down from almost 6x, which gives greater headroom to cope with any temporary fluctuations in performance.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've reduced net debt at the 3i Group level too, from a peak of GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","9 billion  in 2009 to just over GBP 0.",2322
18511,"2011m11","5 billion today, giving us a stronger position as we enter an increasingly uncertain period for realizations in refinancings.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The quality of our asset management and investment capabilities has also been strengthened as evidenced by the performance of recent new investments.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The teams are very focused on maintaining their investment discipline and managing the portfolio to maximize value.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Another area where we've changed 3i is the cost base.",2322
18511,"2011m11","By adjusting our operational and financial structure, and maintaining a focus on our core competencies, we've reduced operating expenses by 1/3 over the past 3 years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Last year, we announced the combination of our European growth and buyout teams to form a single European private equity team.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As we reach the end of the Eurofund V investment period, we are now further reshaping this combined business to reflect the current market condition and the likely new investment environment over the next few years.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In addition, we're integrating our U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","team to create a developed markets private equity team.",2322
18511,"2011m11","This will allow operating efficiencies to be achieved, which in turn, enables a reduction of operating expenses by at least GBP 15 million a year from financial year 2012-13.",2322
18511,"2011m11","These steps reflect the natural progression of our private equity business.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The team will be well positioned to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities as they arise and will have the full support of the 3i balance sheet.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In developing markets private equity, we strengthened our China team with the appointment of Paul Su.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We've also received an allocation to invest in local currency from the Chinese government.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And in Brazil, we've established an advisory board to support the local team in São Paulo.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The changes in the private equity business also require some changes to the leadership team and a realignment of leadership roles.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As we've already announced, Simon Borrows has joined as Chief Investment Officer, while his predecessor, Ian Nolan, is leaving 3i.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Menno Antal and Alan Giddins will jointly lead our developed markets private equity business, covering Europe and the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11",", and Guy Zarzavatdjian will take over responsibility for developing markets in addition to his current responsibility for the Growth Capital Fund.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Bob Stefanowski will step down from the leadership team to focus on 2 of our larger portfolio companies.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In our Infrastructure and Debt Management business lines, performance has been robust, and we're pursuing a number of initiatives.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The European infrastructure assets have performed well, and during the period, 3i Infrastructure's consortium was announced as a preferred bidder on the U.",2322
18511,"2011m11","'s Thameslink rail project.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In India, we've launched the second India Infrastructure Fund, which we expect to complete during 2012.",2322
18511,"2011m11","In debt management, the CLO funds are performing ahead of our original business plan, generating good advisory and performance fees.",2322
18511,"2011m11","During this period, we've launched a new Credit Opportunities Fund, initially funded by 3i, which will aim to take advantage of the dislocation that we see in credit markets.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I now want to turn towards our current priorities.",2322
18511,"2011m11","3i's first priority is to maximize the value of our existing investments by supporting them through current economic conditions so that they're well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities that will follow.",2322
18511,"2011m11","We're also focused on maintaining investment discipline across our business lines.",2322
18511,"2011m11","All the deals we do must be reviewed in the light of constantly changing economic conditions, and we need to ensure that we pay the right price at the right time.",2322
18511,"2011m11","It's also vitally important that we continue with the conservative balance sheet strategy we followed since 2009.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Doing so will give greater security to all our stakeholders in this uncertain environment.",2322
18511,"2011m11","A key part of our strategy is to grow the business in a measured way.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Some good examples of this are the second Indian infrastructure fund raising and the Credit Opportunities Fund that I've already mentioned.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Together, these priorities feed into the delivery of our strategic model, and allow us to provide shareholders with more stable and consistent returns over the economic cycle.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Now having introduced our model for returns in May and completed our review of the European private equity business, the board has now decided the appropriate proportion of those returns that should take the form of dividend.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I'm pleased to announce that, subject to shareholder approval, we're raising the full year dividend to 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","1p per share, and this is an increase of 125% on the previous year, of which we're declaring an interim dividend of 2.",2322
18511,"2011m11","From this higher base, we expect to grow the dividend progressively, in line with the performance of the business and its balance sheet strength.",2322
18511,"2011m11","The board has also considered undertaking share buybacks and, while accepting the principle of buybacks, has concluded that such purchases are not appropriate at the current time, particularly given the extreme uncertainty in financial markets and low levels of business and consumer confidence.",2322
18511,"2011m11","And now before I pass to Julia, let me give you the key metrics for the period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","As I've said, our gross return has been primarily driven by market conditions, most notably the decline in multiples used for valuation purposes.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Although as a whole, our investments have displayed resilient underlying performance, the general softening of market conditions has led to a negative gross investment return of 8.",2322
18511,"2011m11","After cost and financing, this results in a negative total return of 15.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Despite the tough environment, we achieved a good level of realizations at GBP 532 million, although most of these were in the first half of this 6-month period.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Investment during this period was GBP 448 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our gross debt currently stands at GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","7 billion, and taking into account our cash balances, we have net debt of GBP 531 million.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Our liquidity, which includes cash and undrawn facilities, is GBP 1.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Julia will now take you through these numbers, along with the other financials, in more detail.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Just a few questions.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Some of these are quite short.",2322
18511,"2011m11","I just wondered what the pro forma gearing is, because obviously you've had the MWM proceeds since the year end.",2322
18511,"2011m11","Has there been any big investments to offset that?",2322
18511,"2011m5","One of the things we said in our pre-close statement is that we're seeing a combination of different trading performances by geography and there were some asset-specific issues.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Within the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5",", we've seen softer trading in a number of our business and that's fully reflected in the results today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The businesses that have been suffering the most have tended to be ones that are domestically focused.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've got other businesses in the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've got a great business based in Yorkshire, an engineering business called ADS, which has a record turnover, record profits.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Because it's an engineering business, where it's exporting to India, China and the growing markets around the world.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So that's a common theme that we see, where our businesses have got a high export content to developing markets that are performing very, very well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And that's why we've seen strong business performance in the Benelux, in Nordic and in Germany, where many of the businesses we've invested have that profile.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So it's that, the balance between domestic sales and export in which is probably the biggest single factor.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The best way of looking at that is if you remember the chart that Julia showed with all the different pie charts on, as Julia said she wasn't going to go into detail in that.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But if you actually look at that chart, it gives you a very, very good overview of where the sectoral concentrations are, whether geographic concentrations are.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And 1 of the reasons why we wanted to draw people's attention for that is we believe we've got a very, very diverse type for polio and what you're seeing now is as we expand our activities on a global basis, what used to be a historic point of concentration in the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","is now becoming much less a part of our asset base.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We'll continue to invest in the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","and we've done some great deals here, as I mentioned, Go Outdoors.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But there isn't any particular area of concentration that I would mention.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But take a look at that chart if that doesn't answer your question and give us a call.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Just quickly, in terms of your 3 business areas, so Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management, do you have target allocations or in the future? Because that's changed significantly in terms of proportion of portfolio invested in those areas by reference to what it is now.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Andrew Bell from Whitman Investment Trust.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I got 3 questions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The first is with the significant U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","write-down, does it reflect a distressed business or simply is it a mathematical result of applying the right multiple to the business and that just leaves nothing for the equity at the moment that it might recover? Second is other people who manage external funds have found that there's pressure from the fund holders to concentrate the returns on the people working for their funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So that they're not disadvantaged and how are you going to make sure that the benefit, which is part of an integral part of the return from the lower return asset categories, how are you sure that you capture those benefits for 3i rather than they're being hypothecated as it were towards the people who are focused on those funds? And the third is this admiral portfolio that you talk just about even after today, share price rises now still available on about a 17% or 18% discount.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It would be helpful if you give a different color on your policy on the share buybacks? From Nomura.",1413
18511,"2011m5","For your U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","portfolio specific company or can you just comment on to the rate of crossing terms order other investment in the  U.",1413
18511,"2011m5",", please? You anticipate much closer to the £1 billion at into next year significant step up? Philip, I think estimating the demand and supply of capital is always going to be more of an outer science.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our view is that at the margin, it's going to get better.",1413
18511,"2011m5","One of the things I didn't talk about though was what corporate behavior will be because corporate has got more cash than they've ever had at any point, and I've been surprised how little M&A activities they driven through corporate so you got all of that factor in as well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What we're focused in on though is those sectors and geographies where we believe we have real insights into individual businesses.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And if you look at some of the deals that we've done in the last 12 months, they're very, very good examples of this.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So the Digi, the chain of private hospitals that we bought in France, it's a very good example.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Because we previously owned a similar chain in the Nordic region called Ambea, where over a number of years, we basically acquired a series of similar businesses, integrated them, improved the trading performance of all these businesses and saw a very substantial uplift in value.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So in the Digi our plan is to acquire a great platform to grow that business through a combination of improved operating performance, but also acquiring smaller, local businesses that we can add into it.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And you'll see some of our investment goes into supporting inquisitive growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So very common part of our investment is now.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Other business that we invested in last year for the first time was a business called Fresco, a fruit juice business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","They've made a major acquisition using capital from 3i over the last 12 months and will continue to do so.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Another business that we talked about before Labco, a laboratories business in France.",1413
18511,"2011m5","They've made about 25 acquisitions over the last couple of years as we consolidate that highly fragmented sector.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So a combination of sector insight, helping businesses internationalize, move into Asian markets, improving their operating performance and identifying platforms for growth that we can then make acquisitions through are part of our investment thesis.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So Private Equity is no longer about hoping for multiple arbitrage, leveraging something out and then selling a few years later at a higher price.",1413
18511,"2011m5","A lot of hard work that goes into improving the performance of these businesses.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Well, good morning, everyone.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Today, we're going to set out the results of the group and how each of our businesses are performing.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I want to use this results presentation to explain how our strategy is developing and give you a financial framework to assess both these results and our future performance updates.",1413
18511,"2011m5","After this brief introduction, Julia will provide a detailed financial review and I'll then set out the market background and give you more detail on our strategy and financial objectives for the future.",1413
18511,"2011m5","These are the key messages that run through these results.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The underlying performance of each business line is positive and we've come very long way in 2 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Strategically, the acquisition of MIM to form a Debt Management business line is an important step forward on our growth agenda.",1413
18511,"2011m5","3i Debt Management will provide yield and lower volatility earnings.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've also reviewed our approach to investment in asset management.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've improved where necessary, for example, in bringing together our Buyout and Growth Capital business so that they might operate more effectively in the market.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I'm pleased that the benefits of this move are already showing through in an increase in investment activity.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This year, we completed 10 high-quality transactions across our network, investing £1.",1413
18511,"2011m5","5 billion in total.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The final message reflects our commitment to manage 3i, with both strong liquidity and low leverage, and you'll see that we're continued to bring down absolute levels of borrowing.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Before handing over to Julia, I want to summarize the progress we've made over the past 2 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Firstly, the financial security of the company needed to be reestablished and the steps that we took in early 2009 to restructure and derisk the balance sheet helped us to achieve this sooner than expected.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Secondly, we needed to protect value in the portfolio and then ensure businesses were achieving their full potential.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Thirdly, we've made important management and cultural changes to create a winning model.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And finally, we're now moving back to a growth agenda.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So let me now turn to this year's financial highlights.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Julia's going to take you through these numbers in more detail, but let me focus on 2 aspects of these results.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Total return of 10.",1413
18511,"2011m5","6% or £324 million was achieved despite an impairment in value of £198 million in respect of a large U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","asset which is now valued at zero.",1413
18511,"2011m5","While this write-down is disappointing, the overall results highlight the resilience of the business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And this performance was underpinned by portfolio earnings growth of 13% and good uplifts on the sale of assets of 26%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And it's this underlying strength that gives us confidence to recommend an increase of 20% in the dividend.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'm now going to hand over to Julia who will take us through the detail behind these numbers but when I come back, I'll set out a very important series of ways in which we're challenging ourselves to deliver returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of your capital question.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think it's a very good point.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And what we have seen, particularly in Europe is growth-orientated businesses have been relatively reluctant to actually press the button on expansion.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I mean there's been a lot of diversion in a lot of diversion actually taking new steps forward.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What we have seen to in the last 3 to 4 months is that attitude changing.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And already in the new financial year, we've actually completed another 2 growth capital transactions, 1 in the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","in Go Outdoors which is a U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","retail concept which we're very excited about and we think it's got every category killer, and also we've invested in a French-based international freight forwarding and management business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the pipeline for growth capital investments is actually the strongest it's been for a number of years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So I think it was around reticence to commit to growth by businesses, but that now seems to be baby and we are seeing some very good opportunities.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Bruce Hamilton, Morgan Stanley.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Two quick questions please.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Firstly, on the earnings growth you had 18 months of pretty solid earnings growth probably along above longer-term average.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Is there still sort of an embedded catch-up there or should we see things probably kind of normalize from here? And then secondly, in terms of your most recent sort of buyout fund, can you remind us how much is invested so when we might expect you to come back and raise another fund and where you are currently marked in terms of multiple invested capital and in terms of IRR.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Well, thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'd now like to take you through our results for the period of the 31st of March 2011.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let me begin with the financial highlights in some more detail.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Michael said at the outset we closed the year with a total return of £324 million, a return on opening shareholders funds of 10.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This translates into an increase of 30p in net asset value from 321p to 351p per share.",1413
18511,"2011m5","1% gross portfolio return was driven by strong earnings growth and a good level of realized profits, combined with uplift to imminent sales.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We continue to take advantage of open markets realizations, generating uplifts of 26% over opening valuations.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we've also seen a 14% increase in fee income over the period.",1413
18511,"2011m5","There was a significant increase in asset bundle management.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is mainly due to the growth of our Debt Management business following the acquisition of Mizuho Securities and Debt business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","and this added for some £3.",1413
18511,"2011m5","4 billion passed our assets under management.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Investments of £719 million is significantly ahead of last year's historically low levels.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And although realizations are considerably lower at £609 million than last year, this figure does not include the sale of Heber and the IPO of NORMA.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Together these transactions delivered the further £255 million to the group in April, an evidence of our success in our portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The net effect of this investments activity means we finished the year with strong liquidity of £1.",1413
18511,"2011m5","8 billion and net debt of £522 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We remain positive about the outlook for 3i and the strength of our business, our portfolio and our brand.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Reinforcing this, we declared a dividend of 2.",1413
18511,"2011m5","4p, a total increase of 20% in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Turning then to returns, and just to remind you how our returns are made up.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Gross portfolio return shows the returns from those assets in which 3i invests directly.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I'll come on to talk in more detail about how each of our business lines have performed this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In total, the group generated a gross portfolio return of £601 million or 17.",1413
18511,"2011m5","1% return on opening portfolio value.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Next portfolio return includes the benefits of our Asset Management business to increase the fees and we carried that we generate to managing investments on behalf of others.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The increase in fees in the year primarily reflects the first full year of the Growth Capital Fund.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Net portfolio return also increased the costs of running our investment in Asset Management businesses.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Those operating expenses continued to fall in the year despite adding the costs of the new Debt Management team.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Finally, to get to total return, we take account of the cost of our own balance sheet funding and other factors such as the pension and foreign exchange.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As I indicated in November, interest cost has been higher in the year as we reshaped the maturity profile of our debt in line with our conservative balance sheet approach.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In particular, the £127 million net interest cost reflects our decision to issue a 7-year bond in March 2010.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is to take advantage of the market opportunity, but it was somewhat ahead of the convertible bond maturity that we have this month.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have mitigated this overlap by buying in the convertible bond throughout the year where it was available.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've now extended our balance sheet hedging policy to include foreign currency swaps, as well as core currency borrowing.",1413
18511,"2011m5","At the year-end, we hedged 68% of our Euro portfolio and 46% of our dollar portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The unhedged elements of the portfolio resulted in a net exchange movement of £17 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Finally, the accounting valuation of our U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","-defined benefits pension scheme resulted in an actuarial gain of £20 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're in discussion with the trustees of this scheme regarding its latest trend in evaluation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Now that the scheme is close to new members and to future accrual for existing members, we're taking further steps to derisk the scheme to reduce the effects of the scheme on our returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Taking all of these aspects into account, we've closed the year with a total return of 10.",1413
18511,"2011m5","6% or £324 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This translates to an NAV of 351p, an increase of 30p since March 2010.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Looking at those components of return in terms of NAV progression, this slide shows you how we've increased NAV from 321p at the start of the year to 351p at the end.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Gross portfolio return from our direct investments contributed 63p.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The net effect of the benefits of Asset Management, offset by the cost of running the business, reduced NAV by 16p.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the cost of the balance sheet, a further 13p.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Dividends paid to shareholders, which here does not include the dividend we've announced today, amount to 3p, all in all resulting in an NAV of 351p at the end of the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So let me now take you through the components of the gross portfolio return in more detail.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This slide shows you the composition of our gross portfolio return and the contributions made by each business line.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As we'd expect, given the nature and the relative size of its direct portfolio, the most significant contributor is our Private Equity business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This generated a return of 16% or £462 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Realizations are lower, as I've already mentioned, but with good uplifts of 20%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Unrealized returns of £277 million were driven by good earnings performance across much of the portfolio, although these were partially offset by significant impairments and the portfolio to value this portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'll come back to talk about this unrealized value growth into more detail in the next few slides.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Portfolio income of £123 million in our Private Equity business and in buyouts in particular principally comprises the capitalized interest, and so does not generate cash yield until the underlying investment is sold.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That said, a number of our growth capital investments have paid dividends in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Turning then to our Infrastructure business, the gross portfolio return of £45 million or 11% from our Infrastructure business affects the movement in our 33% holding in 3i Infrastructure Plc and value movements on investments held through it 3i India Infrastructure Fund.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As Cressida Hogg reported last week, the underlying performance of Infrastructure portfolio is robust with good new investments in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our Infrastructure business we also benefit from dividend income from 3i Infrastructure Plc of £16 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Finally, our Debt Management business, before I comment on its returns for this year, let me just remind you what this business line is now made up of.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our approach to strategic development is to build from our strengths and our expertise.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have had a well-established banking team within our Private Equity business through a number of years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That team has been instrumental in managing our banking relationships through the period from 2007 to today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In 2007, that team sets up a debt warehouse investing in European mid-market credit.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In other words, in the title businesses we were very familiar with.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As our knowledge developed, we looked for opportunities to expand this platform.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our acquisition of Mizuho's European Debt business brought a team of 28 people, led by Jeremy Ghose and has significantly enhanced our capacity for growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We now manage 8 funds and are looking for further opportunities to build on our expertise.",1413
18511,"2011m5","At the same time, we've taken advanced market conditions to unwind substantially the original debt warehouse.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This disposal generated proceeds of £145 million, realized profits of £24 million and an uplift of 20%, which you can see here is the most significant aspect of Debt Management's gross portfolio return this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","With the European acquisition only completed in February, its effect in the results is actually minimal.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'll now take you through our valuations for the year in more detail and how that £325 million of total unrealized value growth arises.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Strong earnings growth in the portfolio is reflected in the earnings growth movement of £295 million and in the uplift to imminent sales of £240 million, a total contribution of £535 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This highlights the strong underlying performance of much of the portfolio, a trend which is being consistent throughout the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In particular, we have seen some excellent performance in our northern European portfolio, and those companies which are expanding their businesses to take advantage of Asian growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Also consistent with the half year, we continue to see a reduction in multiples used to value the portfolio, and this resulted in a negative value movement of £76 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Clearly, a disappointing aspect of this year's performance is the £196 million impairment compared to last year's reversal of £47 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The impairment includes a significant movement of £198 million in respect of a single U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have taken a more cautious view on its earnings, and as a result, made a significant revision to the comparable multiples set.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's a combination of these factors that has given rise to the impairment, which has taken the value of the asset to null.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our change in view is attributable to both sector and to company-specific factors it does not reflect the view that it affects the broader portfolio where we continue to see good underlying performance.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Provisions of £71 million account for about 2% of opening portfolio value.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And they relate to 7 assets in a variety of sexes and geographies.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Together, they do not show a particular concentration risk.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Positively, it includes a reversal of £18 million in relation to an additional asset, which is showing signs of good earnings recovery of the significant intervention on our part.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This company now moves back to an earnings basis evaluation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The positive contribution of £4 million from those assets valued on a DCF basis relates to the investments made through our Indian Infrastructure Fund and to a small number of private equity businesses.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Finally, although the total unrealized value movements is lower in absolute terms than last year, the contribution of strong earnings growth from the portfolio and uplift to imminent sales is much more significant, and is an indicator of our confidence in the underlying performance of the portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Picking up on this point in more detail, you can see from this slide how the earnings growth and multiple movements have trended in the last 2 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","These numbers relate to those companies that are valued on an earnings basis at the beginning and at the end of the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As I've already said, we continue to see strong earnings growth in much of our portfolio, notwithstanding some impairments.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Earnings growth of 13% contributed £295 million to returns compared to a decline of 8% in the prior year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That growth has also continued consistently throughout the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Around 3 quarters of this portfolio contributes a positive earnings growth during the year and more than 40% of the portfolio showed earnings growth of more than 30%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And of course we're working very hard the company showed earnings decreases to get them back on plan.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Much of this portfolio, 84% of it, has been valued using the management accounts to the 31st of December 2010.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, we also review the latest management accounts available, and if they or the current year forecasts indicate a downturn in performance, we take that into account in our valuation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This year, 12% of companies were in this category, which is stable compared to last year and is a market improvement in 2009 were 39% of the portfolio was valued on a current year forecast basis.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Turning to multiples, equity markets remain volatile in the 12-month period in 31st of March 2011.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Overall, we've seen a 7% decline in the multiples used to value the majority of the portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The multiples we choose are based on comparable sets of multiples for each company.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We consider factors such as geography, sector, size and earnings performance.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We also compare the end result, in this case the 7% full, to the equivalent indices in the sectors and the geographies in which we invest.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And those indices showed very similar movements in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The weighted average multiples used to value the portfolio fell to 8.",1413
18511,"2011m5","8 before discount compared to 9.",1413
18511,"2011m5","5 in March 2010.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As a result of this reduction, value growth decreased by £76 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So as we start the half year, those elements of the valuation which directly reflect the performance of the investments, have remained strong in the second half, and notwithstanding a small number of asset-specific reductions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The unrealized value growth on our portfolio is obviously a key driver of our returns and also of a balance sheet portfolio value.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This slide shows you the progression of the portfolio value during the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The opening portfolio was £3.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This increased by £719 million of investments and the positive contribution from the revaluation of £325 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","After taking account the divestments and other movements, the closing portfolio value was £4 billion at the 31st of March 2011.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let me just spend a few minutes elaborating on that £719 million of investment in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is a significant increase following a period of low activity levels, and is consistent with the recovery in activity levels seen in the European private equity market, which Michael will talk in more detail about shortly.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have maintained a highly selective approach to new investment, looking for investments where we believe our sector expertise and our international network could make a difference.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, the competitive environment remains, which has meant a number of transactions have had a very long lead time.",1413
18511,"2011m5","You can see from this slide we invested £270 million in private equity.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is in 6 new deals, most of which were undrawn Europe from 5 mandates.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We also invested in 3 new deals in our Indian Infrastructure Fund and I would encourage you to look at the results in the presentation given by Cressida and the infrastructure team last week, which gives you plenty of detail on the progress being made there.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In addition to making new investments, we continue to support our existing portfolio, providing £80 million of capital to fund new acquisitions and capital expenditure.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As we noted in the half year, we also invested £110 million in buying discount at existing businesses.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the cost of equity cures and capital restructurings were low at £16 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Capitalized interest of £158 million relates largely to the buyout portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So what effect has that and the realizations had on the makeup of our portfolio? This slide sets out the portfolio by business, geography, sector and vintage, and it's helpful in understanding the shape of our business today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I am not going to spend any time going through this in detail, but it is clear from the analysis that the portfolio remains well diversified.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Now I'd like to turn to the rest of the balance sheet.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've continued to adopt the conservative approach to our balance sheet management and remain committed to our limit on net debt of £1 billion.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've also continued to make progress in reducing our gross debt.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This has fallen significantly in the period from £2.",1413
18511,"2011m5","5 billion to £2 billion, as we abort on the convertible bond, bought back some of our 2012 maturities and took a positive decision not to refinance other debt which has fallen due in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","There was an increase in net debt and gearing as a result of net cash outflow during the period.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, net debt of £522 billion is comfortably within our £1 million limit.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The group's liquidity position remains very strong at £1.",1413
18511,"2011m5","8 billion, meaning we're well-placed to take advantage of investment and strategic opportunities as they arise.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The macroeconomic environment is still uncertain whilst this prevails, our strategy is to continue to manage the balance sheet on a conservative basis.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We recognize that this has a negative effect on our returns in the short-term.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We continually look for opportunities to mitigate this while maintaining flexibility for funding.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As Michael will explain shortly, it is very much our intention to deploy capital wisely and in a way that is consistent with our model for returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Thus in summary, we have continued to diversify the business across 3 core businesses and has been an increase of activity across all of them.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Notwithstanding a small number of asset-specific write-downs that has been geared underlying performance in the portfolio, the stronger earnings performance across many of our portfolio companies.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the business is very well-funded, with strong liquidity to take advantage of new investment opportunities to support future growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So thank you, and I will now hand back to Michael.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I mean we're seeing -- the private equity the second secondary private equity market, I think, it's certainly likely to be a major part of all private equity activity over the next 4 or 5 years and certainly in the last year, we've seen it.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So what we actually saw was about half of the transactions that we were involved in were secondary transactions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That's more predominant in half of the European transactions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In India, clearly, it's a very different market and there are no secondary transactions in that market.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It was in the other area where there's quite a few transactions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But if we look forward and we look at the number of companies across Europe that are now owned by private equity firms, it's about 2,000 companies.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And all of those companies have to be sold in the next 4 or 5 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So in terms of the proportion of M&A activity, the private equity sales will contribute, it's going to be growing compared to what we've seen historically.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So I think everybody is likely to see more secondary activity than you've seen historically.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Where that trend will end, it's hard to say.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What's important about secondary transactions though, is you've got to be very clear about what you're going to do with that business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So the assets that we've acquired, we have a very clear value strategy on how the 3i model will move that business on and generate additional returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What we're not looking to do is buy from somebody who operates a similar model to us because they've probably done all of the things that we were going to do.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So we're going to have a clear value creation strategy in place.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have received £325 million of additional realization so far.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So you're not 1 million miles out if you say it was about £253 million at the moment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I've got a couple.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Firstly on the sale gain number, that was particularly strong.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I was wondering if you could just give us a bit more color on that, presume that includes things like the £60 million gain ahead of the NORMA IPO.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the investment rate within the growth capital business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'm just sort of perplexed, given how low that figure is.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think it's around about £70 million for the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Securities.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Looking across the portfolio earnings, if you were to put a profile on it, say, for example, the percentage of earnings that are economically sensitive or is it a percentage during that come from a U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","domestic or other Europe domestic or emerging market demand? Just to give an idea of where the sensitivities are.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And you'll see from our report and accounts we actually quantify that in terms of our attribution analysis for those transactions that we've actually sold.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of the existing funds that we've acquired, we expect that we will be able to achieve those return targets.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But the purpose of establishing the Debt Management business is not to simply stay with the funds that we've got in the moment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","There are opportunities for further consolidation in the sector, and there are certainly very attractive opportunities over the next 2 to 5 years, in terms of launching new funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the reason those opportunities exist is because the banks will struggle to fund all of the corporate debt requirement, both in North America and in Europe over the next 5 years because of the regulatory capital rules that have been brought in.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the bank's exposure to some of the Southern European, Sovereign markets will further exacerbate that position.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So debt management is an area that we feel very excited about and we think there are very, very strong prospects.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So the model is not based on sitting with what we got in the moment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It is about growing the business further.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Just picking up your first question about our sale.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Yes, you're right.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The 3 principal transactions in there are Heber, MWM and the NORMA IPO.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Heber and NORMA completed in April and as I said, it was the beginning of a presentation that's actually not £255 million of proceeds in the MWM is still going to competition.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Your new transactions the proportion of those were from other private equity buyers, like sellers? It really does depend on the opportunities.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What we have seen certainly in terms of what we're targeting around realizations, we've got off to a great start and have front-end loaded our budget on realizations.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That gives us great flexibility if we want to spend on the investments because we're seeing good opportunities to do so.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But certainly, as you saw from the increased investment during the last financial year, we are looking to see growing levels of investment compared to what we've seen historically.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So what we say is we will operate within that £1 billion net debt limit if we go up to because you can good investment opportunity that's fine but equally, as you've seen in the last couple of years, we operated well below that.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Taking your first question about earnings growth, yes, clearly we've seen some extremely strong earnings growth in this period and we do expect to see strong earnings growth continue.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of the catch-up that we talked about previously, I think you should just see that most of our assets are now normalized.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think that being that you should focus on thinking about next year is clearly we've done 6 new investments in the private equity business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Some of these we've had to early indications of those businesses is that they stronger.",1413
18511,"2011m5","They are good investment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So while we are continuing to realize companies delivering strong earnings growth, we are replacing those with good investment as well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think it's also fair to say 1 of the things we've done around our valuation approach this year is we drew -- when we used last 12 months as a valuation metric, which we're doing those of the portfolio, we stopped the last 12 months on the 31st December.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And so in a sense, in previous years, what we've done is we've allowed that to run up to the accounting year-end date.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What we do have though is very good visibility on that quarter's earnings.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we can see that those earnings are continuing to grow.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So we've taken a slightly more conservative approach to the earnings that we use in the valuation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've got good visibility on earnings growth throughout this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So 1 of the reasons why we are standing up in a very confident way about the portfolio is that we do have that visibility on earnings already flowing through.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of Eurofund V the investment Eurofund V comes to an end in November 2011.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So later on this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What that means at practice is that any work in progress that we're working on at November of '11 will continue to be invested.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So in reality, it means that the investment will actually stop in that fund probably around February 2012.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So that's over the course of this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We will be talking to our LP investors about what the next iteration of the fund will look like.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But you will remember from what we said at the half-year is that the next fund that we raise in Europe will be a combined buyout in Growth Capital Fund.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And of course our current Growth Capital Fund doesn't finish its investment period until the end of 2012.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So what we've got to work up is a combined model for that business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we're giving you much more detail around that when we stand up and give our interim results.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of where that fund is marked at the moment, when you get a report of accounts it's probably in all of the we gave today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","There's a table showing for all of our funds what the multiples are.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The multiple on Eurofund V at the moment is standing at 0.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I can't remember, I'm sorry, Bruce, what the exact IRR on that is.",1413
18511,"2011m5","If you'd be able to see in that table what all of funds are performing giving more disclosure on that this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Going forward, we are planning as Julia said very clearly, adopt a very conservative funding strategy.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have a net debt limit at the moment of £1 billion, which clearly has the net asset value growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That becomes an even more and more conservative limit.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And obviously, we're nowhere near that as of the 31st of March.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And as you quite rightly point out, the additional realizations that you come in already in the last 6 weeks mean that we're actually that, that net debt figure has come down even further.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're not assuming that we get any benefit from leverage in the target that we're setting.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So we have not set these targets on the basis of that increase leverage as a helping hand.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have leverage in the business and we run cash balances, really to give us the flexibility to have capital available to deploy at a moment's notice.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That's what we're focused on around our balance sheet management as opposed to having structural leverage that will enhance our returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But clearly you're in 1 side of the equation what really looking to see in the next 6 months is further investments as well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So you've got the numbers for the realizations erosion.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think the targets, the sort of broad working metrics that we're using are not so much targeting an amount that we will have in each area.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But more the funding balance.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we really want to test what the growth opportunities in each area and we're very ambitious in each of the areas and all of them can grow but the funding balance as I said at least 50/50 and private equity.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Infrastructure, the broad metric that we're looking at is 25% on balance sheet, 75% third-party funds and in Debt Management, we would expect about 10% on balance sheet, 90% third-party funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So those are broad working metrics that we're operating in.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Okay, well, thank you all very much for coming.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Julia and I are available for the rest of the day, and indeed, over the next few weeks.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're going to be talking to many of our shareholders.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So we'd be very happy to take any further questions outside this session.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But thank you very much for coming today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Thanks, Julia.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In this next section, I want to give you some background on the market, remind you of our wider strategy and introduce a model for how we generate returns before closing with a few comments on the outlook.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let's look at our markets.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The private equity market continues to be impacted by excess capital that was raised in the peak years of 2006 to 2008, and hasn't yet been spent due to low investment over the past couple of years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We are, however, seeing investment rates begin to pick up, driven by 2 factors: First the return of confidence; and secondly, the pressure on funds to invest as they move towards the end of their investment periods.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The short-term impact of this has been increased competition, which is pushing asset prices up.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, private equity fund raising remains at historically low levels.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Therefore, as investment increases and new fund raising remains low, they expects excess capital to be used up and the investment environment to improve.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As a permanent capital vehicle, 3i is well-positioned to take advantage of this market dynamic.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Turning to the infrastructure market, pressures on public finances will increase deal flow as governments increasingly looked to the private sector as a source of finding.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Such opportunities play to the strengths of 3i's brand, our reputations as responsible investor and our ability to invest for the long term through 3i Infrastructure Plc.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In India, economic development continues to drive a huge demand for India.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's estimated that over the next 5 years, $1 trillion will be invested in the sector.",1413
18511,"2011m5","3i is already recognized as a market leader in Indian infrastructure investment, which positions us well to take advantage of new opportunities through our existing and follow on funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","With respect to Debt Management, we believe that the combined effect of Bill III and liquidity pressures in the banking sector will create attractive opportunities to invest the same factors are also likely to present further acquisition opportunities in both Europe and the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let me remind you of the shape of 3i today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We now have 3 businesses, Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Each business has its own return characteristics and is funded differently from mix of 3i's own balance sheet and external funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Each is differentiated in their respective markets by the strength of 3i's brand.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The benefit from 3i's institutional model and the breadth of our international network.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our permanent capital and strong balance sheet provide a competitive advantage, flexibility in how we manage our business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And a major benefit from managing multiple asset classes is that different risk return profiles that they have.",1413
18511,"2011m5","By investing across all 3 business lines, we can improve the quality of overall returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This next chart shows the progress that the group's made over the past 2 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've added an additional 30p to our net asset value this year, giving an annualized return of 13% over the 2 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I want to build on this progress as we move forward.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Over the past 2 years, we've developed a clear set of priorities to deliver future growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's consistent with our return objectives.",1413
18511,"2011m5","These priorities form the basis for the strategy summarized on this slide.",1413
18511,"2011m5","By building on the 3i brand and growing our reputation as a respected and responsible investor, we will invest in 3i itself, our business lines and Investment portfolios to deliver growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We must ensure that we maintain a consistent approach to the way that we do business to drive performance, build best practice and achieve our objective of delivering consistent returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As an experienced international investment company, managing multiple sources of capital across different asset classes, I believe that we're well-positioned to deliver this strategy for our shareholders and investors.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And let me expand on 2 of these areas of strategy, investment and growth of the business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Starting with investment, 3i and its funds have committed £1.",1413
18511,"2011m5","5 billion to 10 new companies over the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","These include Eversholt, the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","train leasing company, the Digi [ph], a private health care provider in France, and BBG, 1 of India's largest facilities management service providers.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the 1 thing that all of these investments have in common is that they're in sectors and countries we know well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","While our rate of investment has increased significantly over the previous year we've ensured that we retained our measured and highly selective approach in what has remained a very competitive market.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The second aspect of our strategy has been particularly relevant this year is our commitment to grow the business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our Debt Management acquisition in September, which completed in February, has added to our existing Debt Management capabilities and reinforced 3i's strategy of growing in areas consistent with our investment expertise.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our new business line 3i Debt Management, complements the existing private equity and infrastructure businesses, and provides a source of growing and lower volatility returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've also recently announced the recruitment of an experienced team in Brazil.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Led by Marcelo DiLorenzo, the team' has established track record will give us access to opportunities in 1 of the world's fastest-growing regions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What's more, the global nature of 3i's portfolio means that 20% of our companies already have an exposure to Latin America.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And having a team on the ground in that region will provide the support that these companies need to grow.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In Asia, we're looking to raise a second Indian Infrastructure Fund to build on the performance of the first fund.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I hope this demonstrates the ambition that we have to grow our business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're actively pursuing further opportunities to complement our existing business and build on 3i's brand, reputation and expertise.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let me now turn to our model for returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is the framework that I'm using as a management tool to guide 3i's growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I want to spend a few moments on this next slide to explain the model.",1413
18511,"2011m5","3i now operates in 3 distinct asset classes across the risk return spectrum: Private equity, infrastructure and debt.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And although the gross returns of these investments vary, we designed a funding structure that should ease the each business line contributes equally to our long term objective of 15%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This return objective is demanding.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we're looking at it as an average over any given 5-year period.",1413
18511,"2011m5","For those business lines with lower gross return characteristics, namely infrastructure and debt, we have a higher proportion of third-party funds under management, and so receive higher fee income.",1413
18511,"2011m5","By their nature, these asset classes also benefit from more stable earnings, allowing us to deliver a greater consistency of returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let me now show you in more detail how our current business lines fit with this model.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let's firstly take private equity.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That is the business line that contributes the highest gross return to our portfolio to around 20%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's also the business line to which we commit the highest proportion of our own funds, at least a 50/50 split with external investors.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Overall, the net effect of costs, fees and carried interest gives us a long term net return objective of 15%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Moving on to infrastructure, as a lower risk asset class, our gross return objective for infrastructure is lower than private equity at 12%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, since 3i managers are higher proportion of third-party capital, we see a net benefit from fee income, which contributes to an overall net return objective of 15%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And finally, turning to our new Debt Management business line, this has the highest proportion of external funds under management, and so shows the largest positive impact of external management and performance fees.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So again, a 15% return is achieved.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And so I hope you can now see how our 3 business lines work together to achieve our return objectives.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So for shareholders, our net return objective of 15% should translate into a return on equity, also of 15%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And this is the model that I'm using to challenge each of our businesses to deliver over the long term.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And of course in each individual period, the results are likely to vary from these objectives.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But hopefully, this framework should help shareholders understand more clearly the progress that we're making.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This model also serves the dual purpose of being a tool to evaluate new areas of investment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Any new business opportunities will be tested against this framework, and will need to fit with our strategy, our return objectives and enhance the overall 3i business model.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I wanted to look forward to the outlook for 3i.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In the near term, the global economic climate raises considerable uncertainty but is likely to show overall growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, the regional differences will be significant.",1413
18511,"2011m5","in this environment, we will continue to focus on stock selection, and we expect it to increase investment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, this will be well-controlled and focus on regions and sectors where we have a competitive advantage.",1413
18511,"2011m5","3i will also continue to pursue its strategy of investing in its business and reputation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The multi-business line structure that we now operate is designed to provide higher quality and more stable earnings for our investors.",1413
18511,"2011m5","3i is facing the future with confidence.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I hope our new framework for returns clarifies our business and provides a yardstick for future performance.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Before we turn to Q&A, let me pick up on the key messages that I hope you take from this meeting.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Firstly, we're seeing very good underlying performance of our business lines.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've taken 1 notable hit to performance this year in our Private Equity business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But this aside, all 3 business lines are performing in line with our long term return objectives.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've also made good strategic and operational progress.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The creation of 3i Debt Management will not only diversify returns for our investors, but will also provide greater yield and more stable earnings.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In addition, the operational review of our asset management techniques will ensure that we're managing our portfolio optimally and have learned from the challenges of recent years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","To provide greater insight into our businesses, we'll be holding an Investor Day on the 23rd of June, where all our senior business line leaders will be presenting an in-depth review of their businesses and key assets.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've continued to be highly selective with respect to new investment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, we're well-positioned to take advantage of the good quality investment opportunities that are emerging given that we're well-funded and with a strong balance sheet.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Growth from here will be from a solid, financial base and we'll be well-controlled to ensure that we maintain our financial discipline.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Finally, I've introduce to you a model for returns that I intend to use to guide our performance and against which all new business opportunities will be assessed.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This will help to ensure that we're delivering increasing value for our shareholders and the investors in our funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We'll be now very happy to take questions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Philip Middleton from Merrill Lynch.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I just wanted ask on the Buyout business, I can see that burning off a dry powder argument on that degree, but on the other hand, best of competitors are raising funds now.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So there's not going to be an extreme change in market conditions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So how much are you relying on pricing changing in that market, and what else are you doing aside to enable you to generate returns in that business going forward in terms of adding value to your companies and improving your marketing, all those issues? Second question, just on debt, to what extent does that business seems to be returned targets, assuming the status growth? What are targets required for further fundraisings? Pro forma net debt position be if those 3 assets are included then.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Daniel Garrod from Barclays Capital here.",1413
18511,"2011m5","A couple quick questions, if I may.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Wondering if you give some color on those targets, the group ROE target of 15% around the leverage that you intend to employ for the group.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In particular, currently, I wonder if you could outline some £520 million net debt position that you included the proceeds that you've outlined from NORMA, perhaps you can include MWM as well you may get later in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What the pro forma net debt position I imagine would look much closer to sort of zero.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Is that  ROE target achievable with that sort of virtually zero  net debt position target require you to see much closer to your seating of £4 billion.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let me try and answer all of those questions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of the large U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","asset at which there's clearly a lot more detail in the statements that we released today, to address your specific point, the underlying performance of that asset, it is a robust business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's a business with over £1 billion turnover with over a £16 million operating profit and its got an order book over £5 billion so on an operational level, the business is performing well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But it's a business that serves the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","public sector.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And therefore, it's faced the headwinds of U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","public sector cuts.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And as a result of what we see as the lower growth trajectory of that business, we've used a lower earnings multiple to value it.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So that, combined with flat or slightly decreasing earnings, together with a very highly leveraged structure that was put in place at the time of our own original investment, means that the write-down that we're talking about is as you put it, Andrew, a mathematical result of our valuation policy.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we've taken that asset down to zero.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're working very hard in the company, we changed the Chairman, and the Chief Executive.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We reorganized the business to face the new market conditions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So is it possible that the value of that business will come back in due course? The answer to that is we would hope to see some value recovery and we're certainly working towards that.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of your second question, around the share of rewards between employees of a financial business and the shareholders of the financial business, I think actually 3i has managed over the years to strike quite a good balance and that our teams recognize the benefit from the brand, the permanent capital, our market reach, to be able to access great investment opportunities whether in any of our business lines.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And therefore, the sharing of rewards between the employees and the shareholders, I think is in a form that is unlikely to be shifted dramatically.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we're certainly not seeing the pressure that you talk about for a particular move in that direction.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of the share price right now compared to the NAV, I mean, again, mathematically, you're absolutely right.",1413
18511,"2011m5","You're absolutely right on the figure.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I'm showing you here lots of chief executives to be where the share prices.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And there are that many FTSE100 chief executives suit share price is trading at 17% discount to hard assets.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So I think my grievance around might be slightly more credible.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think though the critical thing for us is 1, deliver on the Return on Equity targets; and 2, actually use the framework I've described today to help more people understand 3i, what our business model is and how we're going to deliver returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I think if we get that right, I think the share price will take care of itself.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So what we're focused on as a management team is delivering those Return on Equity objectives.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And right now, we are seeing plenty of opportunities to deploy capital at the kind of returns I talked about.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I think that will be in the longer-term interest of shareholders rather than actually reducing the size of the overall business through buybacks.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Daniel Garrod from Barclays Capital here.",1413
18511,"2011m5","A couple of quick questions, if I may.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I was wondering if you could give some color on those targets, the Groupe ROE target of 15% around the sort of the leverage that you intend to employ for the Groupe.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In particular, currently, I wonder if you could outline sort of £520 million net debt position, but if you included the proceeds that you've outlined from Hyva and NORMA, and perhaps if you could also include MWM, as well that you may get later in the year, what the pro forma net debt position.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I imagine, it would look much closer to sort of zero.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Is that ROE target achievable with that sort of virtually zero net debt position? Or does it require you pushing much closer to your sort of ceiling of £4 billion? This is Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I've got a couple.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Firstly, on the imminent sale gain number, I mean, that was particularly strong.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I was wondering if you could just give us a bit more color on that.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Presumably that includes things like the £60 million gain ahead of the NORMA IPO.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Then I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the investment rate within the Growth Capital business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'm just sort of perplexed, given how low that figure is.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think it was around about £70 million for the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The best way of looking at that is if you remember the chart that Julia showed with all the different pie charts on, as Julia said, she wasn't going to go into detail in that.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But if you actually look at that chart, it gives you a very, very good overview of where the sectoral concentrations are, where the geographic concentrations are.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I think one of the reasons why we want to draw people's attention to that is we believe we've got a very, very diversified portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And what you are seeing now is that as we expand our activities on a global basis, what used to be a historic points of concentration being the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","is now becoming much less a part of our asset base.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We'll continue to invest in the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","and we've done some great deals here, as I mentioned, GO Outdoors.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But there isn't any particular area of concentration that I will mention.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But have a look at that chart, and if that doesn't answer your question, then give us a call.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And do you anticipate being much closer to the £1 billion by the end of next year? Is there going to be a significant step-up? It's Monica Tepes at Westhouse Securities.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Looking across the portfolio earnings, if you were to put a profile on it, say, for example, the percentage of earnings that are economically sensitive or the percentage earnings that come from a U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","domestic or other Europe domestic or emerging market demand, just to give an idea of where the sensitivities are.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's Philip Middleton from Merrill's.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'll have to learn to sit near the front in future.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I just wondered on the buyout business, I can see that burning off dry powder argument to a degree.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But on the other hand, best-of-breed competitors are raising funds now, so there's not going to be an extreme change in market conditions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So how much are you relying on pricing changing in that market? And what else are you doing to try and enable you to generate returns in that business going forward in terms of adding value to your companies and improving your marketing, all those issues? Sorry.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What would the pro forma net debt position be if those 3 assets are included then? Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Just a couple of questions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Firstly, on new transactions, I wondered what proportion of those were from other private equity buyers -- private equity sellers.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It really does depend on the opportunities.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I mean, what we have seen certainly in terms of what we're targeting around realizations, we've got off to a great start in, if you like, front-end loaded our budget on realizations.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That gives us great flexibility if we want to step up investments because we're seeing good opportunities to do so.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But certainly, as you saw from the increased investment during the last financial year, we are looking to see growing levels of investment compared to what we've seen historically.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So what we say is we will operate within that £1 billion net debt limit.",1413
18511,"2011m5","If we go up to it, because we've seen great investment opportunities, well, that's fine.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But equally, as you've seen in the last couple of years, we've operated well below that.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Nathan Archer here from Nomura.",1413
18511,"2011m5","For your U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","portfolio, you've obviously taken the one and specific company hit.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Can you just comment onto the read across in terms of your other investment in the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5",", please? It's Andrew Bell from Witan Investment Trust.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I've got 3 questions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The first is with the significant U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","write-down, does it reflect a distressed business or simply is it a mathematical result of applying the right multiple to the business, and that just leaves nothing for the equity at the moment, but it might recover? The second is other people who manage external funds have found that there's pressure from the fund holders to concentrate the returns on the people working for their funds, so that they're not disadvantaged.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And how are you going to make sure that the benefit, which is part -- an integral part of the returns from the lower return asset categories -- how do you ensure that you capture those benefits for 3i rather than they're being hypothecated as it were towards the people who are focused on those funds? And the third is, this admiral portfolio that you've talked to us about, even after today's share price rise, is now still available on about a 17% or 18% discount.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And it'd be helpful if you could give a bit of color on your policy on the share buybacks.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And you'll see from our report and accounts, we actually quantified that in terms of our attribution analysis for those transactions that we've actually sold.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think it's also fair to say, I mean, one of the things we've done around our valuation approach this year is we drew -- when we use last 12 months as a valuation metric, which we're doing in most of the portfolio, we stopped the last 12 months at the 31st of December.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And so in a sense, in previous years, what we've done is we've allowed that to run up to the accounting year-end date.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What we do have though, is very good visibility on that quarter's earnings.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we can see that those earnings are continuing to grow.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So we've taken a slightly more conservative approach to the earnings that we use in the valuation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've got good visibility on earnings growth throughout this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So one of the reasons why we are standing up in a very confident way about the portfolio is that we do have that visibility on earnings already flowing through.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of Eurofund V, the investment period for Eurofund V comes to an end in November 2011.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So later on this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What that means in practice is that any work in progress that we're working on at November '11 will continue to be invested.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So in reality, it means that the investment will actually stop in that fund probably around February 2012.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So that's over the course of this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We will be talking to our LP [Limited Partner] investors about what the next iteration of the fund will look like.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But you will remember from what we said at the half year is that the next fund that we raise in Europe will be a combined buyout and Growth Capital Fund.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And of course, our current Growth Capital Fund doesn't finish its investment period until the end of 2012.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So what we've got to work up is a combined model for that business, and we're giving -- be giving you much more detail around that when we stand up and give our interim results.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of where that fund is marked at the moment, when you get the report and accounts, it was probably in all the disclosures we gave today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","There was a table showing for all of our funds and what the multiples are.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the multiple on that -- on Eurofund V at the moment is standing at north 0.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I can't remember offhand, I'm sorry, Bruce, what the exact IRR on that is.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But you'd be able to see in that table where all of our funds are performing.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're giving more disclosure on that this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But clearly you're adding in one side of the equation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What we're really looking to see in the next 6 months is further investments as well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So you've got the numbers for the realization side of the equation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Well, thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'd now like to take you through our results for the period to the 31st of March 2011.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let me begin with the financial highlights in some more detail.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Michael said at the outset, we closed the year with a total return of £324 million, a return on opening shareholders funds of 10.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This translates into an increase of 30p in net asset value from 321p to 351p per share.",1413
18511,"2011m5","1% gross portfolio return was driven by strong earnings growth and a good level of realized profits, combined with uplift to imminent sales.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We continue to take advantage of open markets for realizations, generating uplifts of 26% over opening valuations.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we've also seen a 14% increase in fee income over the period.",1413
18511,"2011m5","There was a significant increase in asset under management.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is mainly due to the growth of our Debt Management business, following the acquisition of Mizuho's European debt business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And this adds some £3.",1413
18511,"2011m5","4 billion to our assets under management.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Investments of £719 million is significantly ahead of last year's historically low levels.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And although realizations are considerably lower at £609 million than last year, this figure does not include the sale of Hyva and the IPO of NORMA.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Together, these transactions delivered a further £255 million to the Group in April, an evidence of our success in our portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The net effect of this investment activity means we finished the year with strong liquidity of £1.",1413
18511,"2011m5","8 billion and net debt of £522 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We remain positive about the outlook for 3i and the strength of our business, our portfolio and our brand.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Reinforcing this, we declared a dividend of 2.",1413
18511,"2011m5","4p, a total increase of 20% in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Turning then to returns, and just to remind you how our returns are made up.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Gross portfolio return shows the returns from those assets in which 3i invests directly.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I'll come on to talk in more detail about how each of our business lines have performed this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In total, the Group generated a gross portfolio return of £601 million or 17.",1413
18511,"2011m5","1% return on opening portfolio value.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Next portfolio return includes the benefits of our asset management business, so it includes the fees and the carry that we generate through managing investments on behalf of others.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The increase in fees in the year primarily reflects the first full year of the growth capital fund.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Net portfolio return also increased the costs of running our investment in asset management businesses.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Those operating expenses continued to fall in the year, despite adding the costs of the new Debt Management team.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Finally, to get the total return, we take account of the costs of our own balance sheet funding and other factors, such as the pension and foreign exchange.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As I indicated in November, interest cost has been higher in the year as we reshaped the maturity profile of our debt in line with our conservative balance sheet approach.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In particular, the £127 million net interest cost reflects our decision to issue a 7-year bond in March 2010.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is to take advantage of a market opportunity, but it was somewhat ahead of the convertible bond maturity that we have this month.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have mitigated this overlap by buying in the convertible bond throughout the year where it was available.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've now extended our balance sheet hedging policy to include foreign currency swaps, as well as core currency borrowing.",1413
18511,"2011m5","At the year end, we'd hedged 68% of our euro portfolio and 46% of our dollar portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The unhedged element to the portfolio resulted in a net exchange movement of £17 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Finally, the accounting valuation of our U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","-defined benefits pension scheme resulted in an actuarial gain of £20 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're in discussion with the trustees of this scheme, regarding its latest triennial valuation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Now that the scheme has closed to new members and to future accrual for existing members, we're taking further steps to de-risk the scheme to reduce the effects of the scheme on our returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Taking all of these aspects into account, we've closed the year with a total return of 10.",1413
18511,"2011m5","6% or £324 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This translates to an NAV of 351p, an increase of 30p since March 2010.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Looking at those components of return in terms of NAV progression, this slide shows you how we've increased NAV from 321p at the start of the year to 351p at the end.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Gross portfolio return from our direct investments contributed 63p.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The net effect of the benefits of Asset Management, offset by the cost of running the business, reduced NAV by 16p, and the cost of the balance sheet, a further 13p.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Dividends paid to shareholders, which of course here do not include the dividend we've announced today, amount to 3p, all in all resulting in an NAV of 351p at the end of the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So let me now take you through the components of the gross portfolio return in more detail.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This slide shows you the composition of our gross portfolio return and the contributions made by each business line.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As we'd expect, given the nature and the relative size of its direct portfolio, the most significant contributor is our private equity business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This generated a return of 16% or £462 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Realizations are lower, as I've already mentioned, but we're at good uplifts of 20%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Unrealized returns of £277 million were driven by good earnings performance across much of the portfolio, although these were partially offset by significant impairments and a fall in multiples used to value this portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'll come on to talk about this unrealized value growth in some more detail in the next few slides.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Portfolio income of £123 million in our private equity business and in buyouts, in particular, principally comprises the capitalized interest, and so does not generate cash yield until the underlying investment is sold.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That said, a number of our growth capital investments have paid dividends in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Turning then to our infrastructure business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The gross portfolio return of £45 million or 11% from our infrastructure business reflects the quoted [ph] movement in our 33% holding in 3i Infrastructure plc and value movements on investments held through 3i India Infrastructure Fund.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As Cressida Hogg reported last week, the underlying performance of the infrastructure portfolio is robust, with good new investments in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In our infrastructure business, we also benefit from dividend income from 3i Infrastructure plc of £16 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Finally, our Debt Management business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Before I comment on its returns for this year, let me just remind you what this business line is now made up of.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our approach to strategic development is to build from our strengths and our expertise.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have had a well-established banking team within our private equity business for a number of years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That team has been instrumental in managing our banking relationships through the period from 2007 to today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In 2007, that team set up a debt warehouse investing in European mid-market credit.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In other words, in the type of businesses we were very familiar with.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As our knowledge developed, we looked for opportunities to expand this platform.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our acquisition of Mizuho's European debt business brought a team of 28 people, led by Jeremy Ghose and has significantly enhanced our capacity for growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We now manage 8 funds and are looking for further opportunities to build on our expertise.",1413
18511,"2011m5","At the same time, we've taken advantage of market conditions to unwind substantially the original debt warehouse.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This disposal generated proceeds of £145 million, realized profits of £24 million and an uplift of 20%, which you can see here is the most significant aspect of Debt Management's gross portfolio return this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","With the European acquisition only completed in February, its effect on the results this year is actually minimal.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'd now like to take you through our valuations for the year in more detail and how that £325 million of total unrealized value growth arises.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Strong earnings growth in the portfolio is reflected in the earnings growth movement of £295 million and in the uplift to imminent sale of £240 million, a total contribution of £535 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This highlights the strong underlying performance of much of the portfolio, a trend which is being consistent throughout the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In particular, we have seen some excellent performance in our Northern European portfolio, and those companies which are expanding their businesses to take advantage of Asian growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Also consistent with the half year, we've continued to see a reduction in multiples used to value the portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And this resulted in a negative value movement of £76 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Clearly, a disappointing aspect of this year's performance is the £196 million impairment compared to last year's reversal of £47 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The impairment includes a significant movement of £198 million in respect of a single U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have taken a more cautious view on its earnings, and as a result, made a significant revision to the comparable multiples set.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's a combination of these factors that has given rise to the impairment, which has taken the value of the asset to nil.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our change in view is attributable to both sector and to company-specific factors.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It does not reflect the view that affects the broader portfolio where we continue to see good underlying performance.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Provisions of £71 million account for about 2% of opening portfolio value.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And they relate to 7 assets in a variety of sectors and geographies.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Together, they do not show a particular concentration risk.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Positively, it includes a reversal of £18 million in relation to an additional asset, which is showing signs of good earnings recovery after significant intervention on our part.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This company now moves back to an earnings basis evaluation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The positive contribution of £54 million from those assets valued on a DCF basis relates to the investments made through our Indian Infrastructure Fund and to a small number of private equity businesses.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Finally, although the total unrealized value movements is lower in absolute terms than last year, the contribution of strong earnings growth in the portfolio and uplift to imminent sale is much more significant and is an indicator of our confidence in the underlying performance of the portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Picking up on this point in more detail, you can see from this slide how the earnings growth and multiple movements have trended in the last 2 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","These numbers relate to those companies that are valued on an earnings basis at the beginning and at the end of the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As I've already said, we continue to see strong earnings growth in much of our portfolio, notwithstanding some impairments.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Earnings growth of 13% contributed £295 million to returns compared to a decline of 8% in the prior year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That growth has also continued consistently throughout the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Around 3 quarters of this portfolio contributes a positive earnings growth during the year, and more than 40% of the portfolio showed earnings growth of more than 20%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And of course, we're working very hard with the companies that showed earnings decreases to get them back on plan.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Much of this portfolio, 84% of it, has been valued using the management accounts to the 31st of December 2010.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, we also review the latest management accounts available, and if they or the current year forecasts indicate a downturn in performance, we take that into account in our valuation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This year, 12% of companies were in this category, which is stable compared to last year and has marked improvement on 2009 where 39% of the portfolio was valued on a current year forecast basis.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Turning to multiples.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Equity markets remain volatile in the 12-month period to the 31st of March 2011.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Overall, we've seen a 7% decline in the multiples used to value the majority of the portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The multiples we choose are based on comparable sets of multiples for each company.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We consider factors such as geography, sector, size and earnings performance.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We also compare the end result, in this case the 7% fall, to the equivalent indices in the sectors and the geographies in which we invest.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And those indices showed very similar movements in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The weighted average multiples used to value the portfolio fell to 8.",1413
18511,"2011m5","8 before discount compared to 9.",1413
18511,"2011m5","5 in March 2010.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As a result of this reduction, value growth decreased by £76 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So as we start the half year, those elements of the valuation, which directly reflect the performance of the investments, have remained strong in the second half, and notwithstanding a small number of asset-specific reductions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The unrealized value growth on our portfolio is obviously a key driver of our returns and also of a balance sheet portfolio value.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This slide shows you the progression of the portfolio value during the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The opening portfolio was £3.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This increased by £719 million of investments and the positive contribution from the revaluation of £325 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","After taking account of divestments and other movements, the closing portfolio value was £4 billion at the 31st of March 2011.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let me just spend a few minutes elaborating on that £719 million of investment in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is a significant increase, following a period of low activity levels, and is consistent with the recovery in activity levels seen in the European private equity market, which Michael will talk in more detail about shortly.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have maintained a highly selective approach to new investment, looking for investments where we believed our sector expertise and our international network could make a difference.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, the competitive environment remains, which has meant a number of transactions have had a very long lead time.",1413
18511,"2011m5","You can see from this slide, we invested £270 million in private equity.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is in 6 new deals, most of which were under our Eurofund V mandates.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We also invested in 3 new deals in our Indian Infrastructure Fund, and I would encourage you to look at the results in the presentation given by Cressida and the infrastructure team last week, which gives you plenty of detail on the progress being made there.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In addition to making new investments, we've continued to support our existing portfolio, providing £80 million of capital to fund new acquisitions and capital expenditure.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As we announced at the half year, we also invested £110 million in buying debt at a discount at existing businesses.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the cost of equity cures and capital restructurings were low at £16 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Capitalized interest of £158 million relates largely to the buyout portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So what effect has that and the realizations had on the makeup of our portfolio? This slide sets out the portfolio by business, geography, sector and vintage.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And it's helpful in understanding the shape of our business today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'm not going to spend any time going through this in detail, but it is clear from the analysis that the portfolio remains well diversified.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'd now like to turn to the rest of the balance sheet.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've continued to adopt the conservative approach to our balance sheet management and remain committed to our limit on net debt of £1 billion.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've also continued to make progress in reducing our gross debt.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This has fallen significantly in the period from £2.",1413
18511,"2011m5","5 billion to £2 billion, as we have bought in the convertible bond, bought back some of our 2012 maturities and took a positive decision not to refinance other debt, which has fallen due in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","There was an increase in net debt and gearing as a result of net cash outflow in the period.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, net debt of £522 million is comfortably within our £1 billion limit.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The Group's liquidity position remains very strong 
at £1.",1413
18511,"2011m5","8 billion, meaning we're well placed to take advantage of investment and strategic opportunities as they arise.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The macroeconomic environment is still uncertain whilst this prevails, our strategy is to continue to manage the balance sheet on a conservative basis.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We recognize that this has a negative effect on our returns in the short term.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We continually look for opportunities to mitigate this while maintaining flexibility for funding.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As Michael will explain shortly, it is very much our intention to deploy capital wisely, and in a way, that is consistent with our model for returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Thus in summary, we have continued to diversify the business across 3 core businesses and has been an increase in activity across all of them.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Notwithstanding a small number of asset-specific write-downs, there has been good underlying performance in the portfolio, with stronger earnings performance across many of our portfolio companies.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the business is very well funded, with strong liquidity to take advantage of new investment opportunities to support future growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So thank you, and I will now hand back to Michael.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Thanks, Julia.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In this next section, I want to give you some background on the market, remind you of our wider strategy and introduce a model for how we generate returns, before closing with a few comments on the outlook.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let's look at our markets.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The private equity market continues to be impacted by excess capital that was raised in the peak years of 2006 to 2008, and hasn't yet been spent due to low investment over the past couple of years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We are, however, seeing investment rates begin to pick up, driven by 2 factors: firstly, a return of confidence; and secondly, the pressure on funds to invest as they move towards the end of their investment periods.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The short-term impact of this has been increased competition, which is pushing asset prices up.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, private equity fund raising remains at historically low levels.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Therefore, as investment increases and new fund raising remains low, I expect excess capital to be used up and the investment environment to improve.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As a permanent capital vehicle, 3i is well positioned to take advantage of this market dynamic.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Turning to the infrastructure market.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Pressures on public finances will increase deal flow as governments increasingly looked to the private sector as a source of funding.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Such opportunities play to the strengths of 3i's brand, our reputation as a responsible investor and our ability to invest for the long term through 3i Infrastructure plc.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In India, economic development continues to drive a huge demand for India.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's estimated that over the next 5 years, $1 trillion will be invested in the sector.",1413
18511,"2011m5","3i is already recognized as a market leader in Indian infrastructure investment, which positions us well to take advantage of new opportunities through our existing and follow-on funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","With respect to Debt Management, we believe that the combined effect of Basel III [ph] and liquidity pressures in the banking sector will create attractive opportunities to invest.",1413
18511,"2011m5","These same factors are also likely to present further acquisition opportunities in both Europe and the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let me remind you of the shape of 3i today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We now have 3 businesses: private equity, infrastructure and debt.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Each business has its own return characteristics and is funded differently through a mix of 3i's own balance sheet and external funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Each is differentiated in their respective markets by the strength of 3i's brand.",1413
18511,"2011m5","They benefit from 3i's institutional model and the breadth of our international network.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our permanent capital and strong balance sheet provide a competitive advantage and flexibility in how we manage our business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And a major benefit from managing multiple asset classes is the different risk return profiles that they have.",1413
18511,"2011m5","By investing across all 3 business lines, we can improve the quality of overall returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This next chart shows the progress that the Group's made over the past 2 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've added an additional 30p to our net asset value this year, giving an annualized return of 13% over the 2 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I want to build on this progress as we move forward.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Over the past 2 years, we've developed a clear set of priorities to deliver future growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's consistent with our return objectives.",1413
18511,"2011m5","These priorities form the basis for the strategy summarized on this slide.",1413
18511,"2011m5","By building on the 3i brand and growing our reputation as a respected and responsible investor, we will invest in 3i itself, our business lines and investment portfolios to deliver growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We must ensure that we maintain a consistent approach to the way that we do business to drive performance, build best practice and achieve our objective of delivering consistent returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As an experienced international investment company, managing multiple sources of capital across different asset classes, I believe that we're well positioned to deliver this strategy for our shareholders and investors.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And let me expand on 2 of these areas of strategy: investment and growth of the business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Starting with investment, 3i and its funds have committed £1.",1413
18511,"2011m5","5 billion to 10 new companies over the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","These include: Eversholt, the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","train leasing company, Vedici, a private healthcare provider in France, and BVG, one of India's largest facilities management service providers.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the one thing that all of these investments have in common is that they're in sectors and countries that we know well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","While our rates of investment has increased significantly on the previous year, we've ensured that we retain our measured and highly selective approach in what has remained a very competitive market.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The second aspect of our strategy that's been particularly relevant this year is our commitment to grow the business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our Debt Management acquisition in September, which completed in February, has added to our existing Debt Management capabilities and reinforced 3i's strategy of growing in areas consistent with our investment expertise.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our new business line, 3i Debt Management, complements the existing private equity and infrastructure businesses, and provides a source of growing and lower volatility returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've also recently announced the recruitment of an experienced team in Brazil, led by Marcelo Di Lorenzo, the team's established track record will give us access to opportunities in one of the world's fastest-growing regions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What's more, the global nature of 3i's portfolio means that 20% of our companies already have an exposure to Latin America.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And having a team on the ground in that region will provide the support that these companies need to grow.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In Asia, we're looking to raise a second Indian Infrastructure Fund to build on the performance of the first fund.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I hope this demonstrates the ambition that we have to grow our business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're actively pursuing further opportunities to complement our existing business and build on 3i's brand, reputation and expertise.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let me now turn to our model for returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is the framework that I'm using as a management tool to guide 3i's growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I want to spend a few moments on this next slide to explain the model.",1413
18511,"2011m5","3i now operates in 3 distinct asset classes across the risk/return spectrum: private equity, infrastructure and debt.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And although the gross returns of these investments vary, we've designed a funding structure, such that each business line contributes equally to our long term return objective of 15%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This return objective is demanding.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we're looking at it as an average over any given 5-year period.",1413
18511,"2011m5","For those business lines with lower gross return characteristics, namely infrastructure and debt, we have a higher proportion of the third-party funds under management, and so receive higher fee income.",1413
18511,"2011m5","By their nature, these asset classes also benefit from more stable earnings, allowing us to deliver a greater consistency of returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let me now show you in more detail how our current business lines fit with this model.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let's firstly take private equity.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is the business line that contributes the highest gross return to our portfolio to around 20%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's also the business line to which we commit the highest proportion of our own funds, at least a 50/50 split with external investors.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Overall, the net effect of costs, fees and carried interest gives us a long term net return objective of 15%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Moving on to infrastructure.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As a lower risk asset class, our gross return objective for infrastructure is lower than private equity at 12%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, since 3i managers' a higher proportion of third-party capital, we see a net benefit from fee income, which contributes to an overall net return objective of 15%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And finally, turning to our new Debt Management business line, this has the highest proportion of external funds under management, and so shows the largest positive impact of external management and performance fees.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So again, a 15% return is achieved.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And so I hope you can now see how our 3 business lines work together to achieve our return objectives.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So for shareholders, our net return objective of 15% should translate into a return on equity, also of 15%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And this is the model that I'm using to challenge each of our businesses to deliver over the long term.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Of course in each individual period, the results are likely to vary from these objectives.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But hopefully, this framework should help shareholders understand more clearly the progress that we're making.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This model also serves the dual purpose of being a tool to evaluate new areas of investment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Any new business opportunities will be tested against this framework and will need to fit with our strategy, our return objectives and enhance the overall 3i business model.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I wanted to look forward to the outlook for 3i.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In the near term, the global economic climate faces considerable uncertainty, but is likely to show overall growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, the regional differences will be significant.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In this environment, we will continue to focus on stock selection, and we expect to increase investment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, this will be well controlled and focus on regions and sectors where we have a competitive advantage.",1413
18511,"2011m5","3i will also continue to pursue its strategy of investing in its business and reputation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The multi-business line structure that we now operate is designed to provide higher quality and more stable earnings for our investors.",1413
18511,"2011m5","3i is facing the future with confidence.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I hope our new framework for returns clarifies our business and provides a yardstick for future performance.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Before we turn to Q&A, let me pick up on the key messages that I hope you take from this meeting.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Firstly, we're seeing very good underlying performance of our business lines.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've taken one notable hit to performance this year in our private equity business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But this aside, all 3 business lines are performing in line with our long term return objectives.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've also made good strategic and operational progress.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The creation of 3i Debt Management will not only diversify returns for our investors, but will also provide greater yield and more stable earnings.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In addition, the operational review of our asset management techniques will ensure that we're managing our portfolio optimally and have learned from the challenges of recent years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","To provide greater insight into our businesses, we'll be holding an Investor Day on the 23rd of June, where all our senior business line leaders will be presenting an in-depth review of their businesses and key assets.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've continued to be highly selective, with respect to new investment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, we're well positioned to take advantage of the good quality investment opportunities that are emerging, given that we're well funded and with a strong balance sheet.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Growth from here will be from a solid, financial base, and we'll be well controlled to ensure that we maintain our financial discipline.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Finally, I've introduce to you a model for returns that I intend to use to guide our performance and against which all new business opportunities will be assessed.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This will help to ensure that we're delivering increasing value for our shareholders and the investors in our funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We'll be now very happy to take questions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think, I mean, going forward, we are planning to, as Julia said very clearly, adopt a very conservative funding strategy.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have a net debt limit at the moment of £1 billion, which clearly has the net asset value growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That becomes an even more and more conservative limit.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And obviously, we're nowhere near that as of the 31st of March.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And as you quite rightly point out, the additional realizations that have come in already in the last 6 weeks mean that we're actually -- that net debt figure has come down even further.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're not assuming that we get any benefit from leverage in the target that we're setting.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So we have not set these targets on the basis of let's increase leverage as a helping hand.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have leverage in the business and we run cash balances really to give us the flexibility to have capital available to deploy at a moment's notice.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That's what we're focused on around our balance sheet management as opposed to having structural leverage that will enhance our returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's Bruce Hamilton, Morgan Stanley.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Just 2 quick questions please.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Firstly, on the earnings growth, obviously, you've had 18 months of pretty solid earnings growth probably along -- above longer-term averages.",1413
18511,"2011m5","How -- is there still sort of an embedded catch-up there, or should we assume that things probably kind of normalize from here? And then secondly, in terms of your most recent sort of buyout fund, can you remind us how much is invested, so when we might expect you to come back and raise another fund, and where you're currently marked in terms of multiple of invested capital and in terms of IRR? I mean, we're seeing -- I mean, the private equity, the secondary private equity market, I think, is certainly a -- likely to be a major part of all private equity activity over the next 4 or 5 years and certainly in the last year, we've seen it.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So what we actually saw was about half of the transactions that we were involved in were secondary transactions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That's more predominant in -- half of the European transactions, sorry.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In India, clearly, it's a very different market, and there are no secondary transactions in that market.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It was the other area where we did quite a few transactions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But if we look forward and we look at the number of companies across Europe that are now owned by private equity firms, it's about 2,000 companies, and all of those companies have to be sold in the next 4 or 5 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So in terms of the proportion of M&A activity, the private equity sales will contribute, it's going to be growing compared to what we've seen historically.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So I think everybody is likely to see more secondary activity than you've seen historically.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Where that trend will end, it's hard to say.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What's important about secondary transactions though, is you've got to be very clear about what you're going to do with that business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So the assets that we've acquired, we have a very clear value strategy on how the 3i model will move that business on and generate additional returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What we're not looking to do is buy from somebody who operates a similar model to us because they've probably done all of the things that we were going to do.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So we've got to have a clear value creation strategy in place.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Taking your first question about earnings growth, yes, clearly we've seen some extremely strong earnings growth in this period, and we do expect to see strong earnings growth continue.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of the catch-up that we've talked about previously, I think you should assume that most of that has now normalized.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think the thing that you should focus on thinking about next year is clearly we've done 6 new investments in the Private Equity business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Some of these, we've had for a very short period of time, the early -- the indications of those businesses is that they are strong and that they are good investments.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So whilst we are continuing to realize companies that are delivering strong earnings growth, we are replacing those with good investments as well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think the targets, the sort of broad working metrics that we're using are not so much targeting an amount that we will have in each area, but more of the funding balance.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we really want to test what the growth opportunities in each area and we're very ambitious for each of the areas and all of them can grow.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But the funding balance, I said, at least 50/50 in Private Equity.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In Infrastructure, the broad metric that we're looking at is 25% on balance sheet; 75%, third-party funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And in Debt Management, we'd expect about 10% on balance sheet; 90%, third-party funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So those are broad working metrics that we're operating with.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Well, thank you all very much for coming.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Julia and I are available for the rest of the day, and indeed, over the next few weeks.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're going to be talking to many of our shareholders.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So we'd be very happy to take any further questions outside this session.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But thank you very much for coming today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of the existing funds that we've acquired, we expect that we will be able to achieve those return targets.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But the purpose of establishing the Debt Management business is not to simply stay with the funds that we've got at the moment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","There are opportunities for further consolidation of the sector, and there are certainly very attractive opportunities over the next 2 to 5 years in terms of launching new funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the reason those opportunities exist is because the banks will struggle to fund all of the corporate debt requirement both in North America and in Europe over the next 5 years because of the regulatory capital rules that have been brought in.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the bank's exposure to some of the southern European sovereign markets will further exacerbate that position.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So Debt Management is an area that we feel very excited about and we think there are very, very strong growth prospects.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So the model is not based on sitting with what we've got at the moment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It is about growing the business further.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Well, let me try and answer all of those questions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I mean, in terms of the large U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","asset, of which there's clearly a lot more detail in the statements that we released today, to address your specific point, the underlying performance of that asset, it is a robust business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's a business with over £1 billion turnover with over a £16 million operating profit, and its got an order book of over £5 billion.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So on an operational level, the business is performing well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But it's a business that serves the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","public sector.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And therefore, it's faced the headwinds of U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","public sector cuts.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And as a result of what we see as the lower growth trajectory of that business, we've used a lower earnings multiple to value it.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So that, combined with flat or slightly decreasing earnings, together with a very highly leveraged structure that was put in place at the time of our own original investment, means that the write-down that we're talking about is, as you put it, Andrew, a mathematical result of our valuation policy.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we've taken that asset down to zero.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're working very hard with the company.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've changed the Chairman and the Chief Executive.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've reorganized the business to face the new market conditions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So is it possible that the value of that business will come back in due course? The answer to that is, we would hope to see some value recovery and we're certainly working towards that.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of your second question, around the share of rewards between employees of a financial business and the shareholders of the financial business, I think actually 3i has managed over the years to strike quite a good balance and that our teams recognize they benefit from the brand, the permanent capital, our market reach, to be able to access great investment opportunities whether in any of our business lines.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And therefore, the sharing of rewards between the employees and the shareholders, I think, is in a form that is unlikely to be shifted dramatically.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we're certainly not seeing the pressure that you talk about for a particular move in that direction.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of the share price right now compared to the NAV, I mean, again, mathematically, you're absolutely right.",1413
18511,"2011m5","You were absolutely right on the figure.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I'm sure you hear lots of chief executives who bemoan where their share price is.",1413
18511,"2011m5","There aren't that many FTSE100 chief executives whose share price is trading at a 17% discount to hard assets.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So I think my grievance around might be slightly more credible.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think though the critical thing for us is one, deliver on the return on equity targets; and two, actually use the framework I've described today to help more people understand 3i, what our business model is and how we're going to deliver returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I think if we get that right, I think the share price will take care of itself.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So what we're focused on as a management team is delivering those return on equity objectives.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And right now, we are seeing plenty of opportunities to deploy capital at the kind of returns I talked about.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I think that will be in the longer-term interest of shareholders rather than actually reducing the size of the overall business through buybacks.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Iain, in terms of your Growth Capital question, I think -- I mean, I think it's a very good point.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And what we have seen, particularly in Europe, is growth-orientated businesses have been relatively reluctant to actually press the button on expansion.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I mean, there's been a lot of debt aversion and a lot of aversion to actually taking new steps forward.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What we have seen though, in the last 3 to 4 months is that attitude changing.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And already in the new financial year, we've actually completed another 2 Growth Capital transactions: One in the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5",", in GO Outdoors, which is a U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","retail concept, which we're very excited about and we think has got every chance of being a real category killer; and also we've invested in a French-based international freight forwarding and management business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the pipeline for Growth Capital investments is actually the strongest it's been for a number of years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So I think it was around reticence to commit to growth by businesses, but that now seems to be fading, and we are seeing some very good opportunities.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the second question, just on Debt Management, to what extent is that business able to meet your return targets, assuming the status quo? Or do your targets require on further fundraisings? Can I just ask quickly, in terms of your 3 business areas, so Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management, do you have target allocations? Or in the future, could that change significantly in terms of proportion of portfolio invested in those areas by reference to what it is now? Sure.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I mean, one of the things we said in our preclose statement was that we were seeing a combination of different trading performances by geography and then there were some asset-specific issues.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Within the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5",", we've seen softer trading in a number of our businesses, and that's fully reflected in the results today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The businesses that have been suffering the most have been -- have tended to be ones that are domestically focused.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've got other businesses in the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've got a great business based in Yorkshire, an engineering business called AES, which has had a record turnover, record profits, because it's an engineering business, where it's exporting to India, China and the growing markets around the world.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So that's a common thing that we see, where our businesses have got a high export content to developing markets that are performing very, very well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And that's why we've seen strong business performance in the Benelux, in Nordic and in Germany, where many of the businesses that were invested have that profile.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So it's that -- the balance between domestic sales and exporting, which is probably the biggest single factor.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Well, I mean, we've had -- received £325 million of additional realization so far.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So you're not 1 million miles out if you say it was about £253 million at the moment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Well, if there's no more -- oh, there are some more questions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Just picking up your first question about uplifts to sale, yes, you're right.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I mean, the 3 principal transactions in there are Hyva, MWM and the NORMA IPO.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Hyva and NORMA completed in April.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And as I said, it was -- at the beginning of my presentation, that's actually now delivered £255 million of proceeds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","MWM is still going through a competition clearance.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Philip, I think, estimating the demand and supply of capital is always going to be more of an art rather than a science.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So I mean, our view is that at the margin, it is going to get better.",1413
18511,"2011m5","One of the things I didn't talk about though, was what corporate behavior will be because corporates have got more cash than they've ever had at any point, and I've been surprised at how little M&A activities being driven through corporates.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So you got all of that to factor in as well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What we're focused in on though, are those sectors and geographies where we believe we have real insights into individual businesses.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And if you look at some of the deals that we've done in the last 12 months, they're very, very good examples of this.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So Vedici, the chain of private hospitals that we bought in France, is a very good example, because we previously owned a similar chain in the Nordic region called Ambea, where over a number of years, we basically acquired a series of similar businesses and integrated them, improved the trading performance of all these businesses and saw a very substantial uplift in value.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So in Vedici, our plan is having acquired a great platform to grow that business through a combination of improved operating performance, but also acquiring smaller, local businesses that we can add into it.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And you'll see some of our investment goes into supporting acquisitive growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's a very common part of our investment thesis now.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Another business that we invested in last year for the first time was a business called  Refresco, a fruit juice business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","They've made a major acquisition using capital from 3i over the last 12 months and will continue to do so.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Another business that we've talked about before Labco, a laboratories business in France.",1413
18511,"2011m5","They've made about 25 acquisitions over the last couple of years as we consolidate that highly fragmented sector.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So a combination of sector insight, helping businesses internationalize, move into Asian markets, improving their operating performance and identifying platforms for growth that we can then make acquisitions through a part of our investment thesis.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So Private Equity is no longer about hoping for multiple arbitrage, leveraging something up and then selling a few years later at a higher price.",1413
18511,"2011m5","There's a lot of hard work that goes into improving the performance of these businesses.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Well, good morning, everyone.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Today, we're going to set out the results of the Group and how each of our businesses are performing.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I want to use this results presentation to explain how our strategy is developing and give you a financial framework to assess both these results and our future performance updates.",1413
18511,"2011m5","After this brief introduction, Julia will provide a detailed financial review, and then I'll set out the market background and give you more detail on our strategy and financial objectives for the future.",1413
18511,"2011m5","These are the key messages that run through these results.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The underlying performance of each business line is positive, and we've come a very long way in 2 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Strategically, the acquisition of MIM to form a Debt Management business line is an important step forward on our growth agenda.",1413
18511,"2011m5","3i Debt Management will provide yield and lower volatility earnings.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've also reviewed our approach to investment in asset management.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've improved where necessary, for example, in bringing together our buyout and growth capital businesses, so that they might operate more effectively in the market.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I'm pleased that the benefits of this move are already showing through in an increase in investment activity.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This year, we've completed 10 high-quality transactions across our network, investing £1.",1413
18511,"2011m5","5 billion in total.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The final message reflects our commitment to manage 3i, with both strong liquidity and low leverage.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And you'll see that we're continuing to bring down absolute levels of borrowing.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Before handing over to Julia, I want to summarize the progress we've made over the past 2 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Firstly, the financial security of the company needed to be reestablished, and the steps that we took in early 2009 to restructure and de-risk the balance sheet helped us to achieve this sooner than expected.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Secondly, we needed to protect the value in the portfolio, and then ensure businesses were achieving their full potential.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Thirdly, we've made important management and cultural changes to create a winning model.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And finally, we're now moving back to a growth agenda.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So let me now turn to this year's financial highlights.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Julia's going to take you through these numbers in more detail, but let me focus on 2 aspects of these results.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Total return of 10.",1413
18511,"2011m5","6% or £324 million was achieved despite an impairment in value of £198 million, in respect of a large U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","asset, which is now valued at zero.",1413
18511,"2011m5","While this write-down is disappointing, the overall results highlight the resilience of the business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And this performance was underpinned by portfolio earnings growth of 13% and good uplifts on the sale of assets at 26%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And it's this underlying strength that gives us confidence to recommend an increase of 20% in the dividend.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'm now going to hand over to Julia, who will take us through the detail behind these numbers.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But when I come back, I'll set out a very important series of ways in which we're challenging ourselves to deliver returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's Monica Tepes at Westhouse Securities.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Looking across the portfolio earnings, if you were to put a profile on it, say, for example, the percentage of earnings that are economically sensitive or the percentage earnings that come from a U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","domestic or other Europe domestic or emerging market demand, just to give an idea of where the sensitivities are.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Taking your first question about earnings growth, yes, clearly we've seen some extremely strong earnings growth in this period, and we do expect to see strong earnings growth continue.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of the catch-up that we've talked about previously, I think you should assume that most of that has now normalized.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think the thing that you should focus on thinking about next year is clearly we've done 6 new investments in the Private Equity business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Some of these, we've had for a very short period of time, the early -- the indications of those businesses is that they are strong and that they are good investments.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So whilst we are continuing to realize companies that are delivering strong earnings growth, we are replacing those with good investments as well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What would the pro forma net debt position be if those 3 assets are included then? I think it's also fair to say, I mean, one of the things we've done around our valuation approach this year is we drew -- when we use last 12 months as a valuation metric, which we're doing in most of the portfolio, we stopped the last 12 months at the 31st of December.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And so in a sense, in previous years, what we've done is we've allowed that to run up to the accounting year-end date.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What we do have though, is very good visibility on that quarter's earnings.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we can see that those earnings are continuing to grow.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So we've taken a slightly more conservative approach to the earnings that we use in the valuation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've got good visibility on earnings growth throughout this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So one of the reasons why we are standing up in a very confident way about the portfolio is that we do have that visibility on earnings already flowing through.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of Eurofund V, the investment period for Eurofund V comes to an end in November 2011.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So later on this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What that means in practice is that any work in progress that we're working on at November '11 will continue to be invested.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So in reality, it means that the investment will actually stop in that fund probably around February 2012.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So that's over the course of this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We will be talking to our LP [Limited Partner] investors about what the next iteration of the fund will look like.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But you will remember from what we said at the half year is that the next fund that we raise in Europe will be a combined buyout and Growth Capital Fund.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And of course, our current Growth Capital Fund doesn't finish its investment period until the end of 2012.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So what we've got to work up is a combined model for that business, and we're giving -- be giving you much more detail around that when we stand up and give our interim results.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of where that fund is marked at the moment, when you get the report and accounts, it was probably in all the disclosures we gave today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","There was a table showing for all of our funds and what the multiples are.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the multiple on that -- on Eurofund V at the moment is standing at north 0.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I can't remember offhand, I'm sorry, Bruce, what the exact IRR on that is.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But you'd be able to see in that table where all of our funds are performing.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're giving more disclosure on that this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Well, if there's no more -- oh, there are some more questions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Just a couple of questions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Firstly, on new transactions, I wondered what proportion of those were from other private equity buyers -- private equity sellers.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Philip, I think, estimating the demand and supply of capital is always going to be more of an art rather than a science.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So I mean, our view is that at the margin, it is going to get better.",1413
18511,"2011m5","One of the things I didn't talk about though, was what corporate behavior will be because corporates have got more cash than they've ever had at any point, and I've been surprised at how little M&A activities being driven through corporates.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So you got all of that to factor in as well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What we're focused in on though, are those sectors and geographies where we believe we have real insights into individual businesses.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And if you look at some of the deals that we've done in the last 12 months, they're very, very good examples of this.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So Vedici, the chain of private hospitals that we bought in France, is a very good example, because we previously owned a similar chain in the Nordic region called Ambea, where over a number of years, we basically acquired a series of similar businesses, integrated them, improved the trading performance of all these businesses and saw a very substantial uplift in value.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So in Vedici, our plan is having acquired a great platform to grow that business through a combination of improved operating performance, but also acquiring smaller, local businesses that we can add into it.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And you'll see some of our investment goes into supporting acquisitive growth.",1413

18511,"2011m5","So Private Equity is no longer about hoping for multiple arbitrage, leveraging something up and then selling it a few years later at a higher price.",1413
18511,"2011m5","There's a lot of hard work that goes into improving the performance of these businesses.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's Philip Middleton from Merrill's.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'll have to learn to sit near the front in future.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I just wondered on the buyout business, I can see that burning off dry powder argument to a degree.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But on the other hand, best-of-breed competitors are raising funds now, so there's not going to be an extreme change in market conditions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So how much are you relying on pricing changing in that market? And what else are you doing to try and enable you to generate returns in that business going forward in terms of adding value to your companies and improving your marketing, all those issues? I mean, we're seeing -- I mean, the private equity, the secondary private equity market, I think, is certainly a -- likely to be a major part of all private equity activity over the next 4 or 5 years and certainly in the last year, we've seen it.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So what we actually saw was about half of the transactions that we were involved in were secondary transactions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That's more predominant in -- half of the European transactions, sorry.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In India, clearly, it's a very different market, and there are no secondary transactions in that market.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It was the other area where we did quite a few transactions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But if we look forward and we look at the number of companies across Europe that are now owned by private equity firms, it's about 2,000 companies, and all of those companies have to be sold in the next 4 or 5 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So in terms of the proportion of M&A activity, the private equity sales will contribute, it's going to be growing compared to what we've seen historically.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So I think everybody is likely to see more secondary activity than you've seen historically.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Where that trend will end, it's hard to say.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What's important about secondary transactions though, is you've got to be very clear about what you're going to do with that business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So the assets that we've acquired, we have a very clear value strategy on how the 3i model will move that business on and generate additional returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What we're not looking to do is buy from somebody who operates a similar model to us because they've probably done all of the things that we were going to do.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So we've got to have a clear value creation strategy in place.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's Bruce Hamilton, Morgan Stanley.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Just 2 quick questions please.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Firstly, on the earnings growth, obviously, you've had 18 months of pretty solid earnings growth probably along -- above longer-term averages.",1413
18511,"2011m5","How -- is there still sort of an embedded catch-up there, or should we assume that things probably kind of normalize from here? And then secondly, in terms of your most recent sort of buyout fund, can you remind us how much is invested, so when we might expect you to come back and raise another fund, and where you're currently marked in terms of multiple of invested capital and in terms of IRR? Well, thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'd now like to take you through our results for the period to the 31st of March 2011.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let me begin with the financial highlights in some more detail.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Michael said at the outset, we closed the year with a total return of £324 million, a return on opening shareholders funds of 10.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This translates into an increase of 30p in net asset value from 321p to 351p per share.",1413
18511,"2011m5","1% gross portfolio return was driven by strong earnings growth and a good level of realized profits, combined with uplifts to imminent sales.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We continue to take advantage of open markets for realizations, generating uplifts of 26% over opening valuations.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we've also seen a 14% increase in fee income over the period.",1413
18511,"2011m5","There was a significant increase in assets under management.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is mainly due to the growth of our Debt Management business, following the acquisition of Mizuho's European debt business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And this adds some £3.",1413
18511,"2011m5","4 billion to our assets under management.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Investments of £719 million is significantly ahead of last year's historically low levels.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And although realizations are considerably lower at £609 million than last year, this figure does not include the sale of Hyva and the IPO of NORMA.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Together, these transactions delivered a further £255 million to the Group in April, an evidence of our success in our portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The net effect of this investment activity means we finished the year with strong liquidity of £1.",1413
18511,"2011m5","8 billion and net debt of £522 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We remain positive about the outlook for 3i and the strength of our business, our portfolio and our brand.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Reinforcing this, we declared a dividend of 2.",1413
18511,"2011m5","4p, a total increase of 20% in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Turning then to returns, and just to remind you how our returns are made up.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Gross portfolio return shows the returns from those assets in which 3i invests directly.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I'll come on to talk in more detail about how each of our business lines have performed this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In total, the Group generated a gross portfolio return of £601 million or 17.",1413
18511,"2011m5","1% return on opening portfolio value.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Net portfolio return includes the benefits of our asset management business, so it includes the fees and the carry that we generate through managing investments on behalf of others.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The increase in fees in the year primarily reflects the first full year of the growth capital fund.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Net portfolio return also includes the costs of running our investment in asset management businesses.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Those operating expenses continued to fall in the year, despite adding the costs of the new Debt Management team.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Finally, to get the total return, we take account of the costs of our own balance sheet funding and other factors, such as the pension and foreign exchange.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As I indicated in November, interest cost has been higher in the year as we reshaped the maturity profile of our debt in line with our conservative balance sheet approach.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In particular, the £127 million net interest cost reflects our decision to issue a 7-year bond in March 2010.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is to take advantage of a market opportunity, but it was somewhat ahead of the convertible bond maturity that we have this month.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have mitigated this overlap by buying in the convertible bond throughout the year where it was available.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've now extended our balance sheet hedging policy to include foreign currency swaps, as well as core currency borrowing.",1413
18511,"2011m5","At the year end, we'd hedged 68% of our euro portfolio and 46% of our dollar portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The unhedged element to the portfolio resulted in a net exchange movement of £17 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Finally, the accounting valuation of our U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","-defined benefits pension scheme resulted in an actuarial gain of £20 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're in discussion with the trustees of this scheme, regarding its latest triennial valuation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Now that the scheme has closed to new members and to future accrual for existing members, we're taking further steps to de-risk the scheme to reduce the effects of the scheme on our returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Taking all of these aspects into account, we've closed the year with a total return of 10.",1413
18511,"2011m5","6% or £324 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This translates to an NAV of 351p, an increase of 30p since March 2010.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Looking at those components of return in terms of NAV progression, this slide shows you how we've increased NAV from 321p at the start of the year to 351p at the end.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Gross portfolio return from our direct investments contributed 63p.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The net effect of the benefits of Asset Management, offset by the cost of running the business, reduced NAV by 16p, and the cost of the balance sheet, a further 13p.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Dividends paid to shareholders, which of course here do not include the dividend we've announced today, amount to 3p, all in all resulting in an NAV of 351p at the end of the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So let me now take you through the components of the gross portfolio return in more detail.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This slide shows you the composition of our gross portfolio return and the contributions made by each business line.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As we'd expect, given the nature and the relative size of its direct portfolio, the most significant contributor is our private equity business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This generated a return of 16% or £462 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Realizations are lower, as I've already mentioned, but we're at good uplifts of 20%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Unrealized returns of £277 million were driven by good earnings performance across much of the portfolio, although these were partially offset by significant impairments and a fall in multiples used to value this portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'll come on to talk about this unrealized value growth in some more detail in the next few slides.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Portfolio income of £123 million in our private equity business and in buyouts, in particular, principally comprises the capitalized interest, and so does not generate cash yield until the underlying investment is sold.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That said, a number of our growth capital investments have paid dividends in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Turning then to our infrastructure business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The gross portfolio return of £45 million or 11% from our infrastructure business reflects the quoted movement in our 33% holding in 3i Infrastructure plc and value movements on investments held through 3i India Infrastructure Fund.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As Cressida Hogg reported last week, the underlying performance of the infrastructure portfolio is robust, with good new investments in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In our infrastructure business, we also benefit from dividend income from 3i Infrastructure plc of £16 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Finally, our Debt Management business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Before I comment on its returns for this year, let me just remind you what this business line is now made up of.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our approach to strategic development is to build from our strengths and our expertise.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have had a well-established banking team within our private equity business for a number of years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That team has been instrumental in managing our banking relationships through the period from 2007 to today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In 2007, that team set up a debt warehouse investing in European mid-market credit.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In other words, in the type of businesses we were very familiar with.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As our knowledge developed, we looked for opportunities to expand this platform.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our acquisition of Mizuho's European debt business brought a team of 28 people, led by Jeremy Ghose and has significantly enhanced our capacity for growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We now manage 8 funds and are looking for further opportunities to build on our expertise.",1413
18511,"2011m5","At the same time, we've taken advantage of market conditions to unwind substantially the original debt warehouse.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This disposal generated proceeds of £145 million, realized profits of £24 million and an uplift of 20%, which you can see here is the most significant aspect of Debt Management's gross portfolio return this year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","With the European acquisition only completed in February, its effect on the results this year is actually minimal.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'd now like to take you through our valuations for the year in more detail and how that £325 million of total unrealized value growth arises.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Strong earnings growth in the portfolio is reflected in the earnings growth movement of £295 million and in the uplift to imminent sale of £240 million, a total contribution of £535 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This highlights the strong underlying performance of much of the portfolio, a trend which has been consistent throughout the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In particular, we have seen some excellent performance in our Northern European portfolio, and those companies which are expanding their businesses to take advantage of Asian growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Also consistent with the half year, we've continued to see a reduction in multiples used to value the portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And this resulted in a negative value movement of £76 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Clearly, a disappointing aspect of this year's performance is the £196 million impairment compared to last year's reversal of £47 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The impairment includes a significant movement of £198 million in respect of a single U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have taken a more cautious view on its earnings, and as a result, made a significant revision to the comparable multiples set.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It is a combination of these factors that has given rise to the impairment, which has taken the value of the asset to nil.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our change in view is attributable to both sector and to company-specific factors.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It does not reflect the view that affects the broader portfolio where we continue to see good underlying performance.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Provisions of £71 million account for about 2% of opening portfolio value.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And they relate to 7 assets in a variety of sectors and geographies.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Together, they do not show a particular concentration risk.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Positively, it includes a reversal of £18 million in relation to an additional asset, which is showing signs of good earnings recovery after significant intervention on our part.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This company now moves back to an earnings basis evaluation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The positive contribution of £54 million from those assets valued on a DCF basis relates to the investments made through our Indian Infrastructure Fund and to a small number of private equity businesses.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Finally, although the total unrealized value movements is lower in absolute terms than last year, the contribution of strong earnings growth in the portfolio and uplift to imminent sale is much more significant and is an indicator of our confidence in the underlying performance of the portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Picking up on this point in more detail, you can see from this slide how the earnings growth and multiple movements have trended in the last 2 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","These numbers relate to those companies that are valued on an earnings basis at the beginning and at the end of the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As I've already said, we continue to see strong earnings growth in much of our portfolio, notwithstanding some impairments.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Earnings growth of 13% contributed £295 million to returns compared to a decline of 8% in the prior year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That growth has also continued consistently throughout the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Around 3 quarters of this portfolio contributes a positive earnings growth during the year, and more than 40% of the portfolio showed earnings growth of more than 20%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And of course, we're working very hard with the companies that showed earnings decreases to get them back on plan.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Much of this portfolio, 84% of it, has been valued using the management accounts to the 31st of December 2010.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, we also review the latest management accounts available, and if they or the current year forecasts indicate a downturn in performance, we take that into account in our valuation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This year, 12% of companies were in this category, which is stable compared to last year and is a marked improvement on 2009 where 39% of the portfolio was valued on a current year forecast basis.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Turning to multiples.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Equity markets remain volatile in the 12-month period to the 31st of March 2011.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Overall, we've seen a 7% decline in the multiples used to value the majority of the portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The multiples we choose are based on comparable sets of multiples for each company.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We consider factors such as geography, sector, size and earnings performance.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We also compare the end result, in this case the 7% fall, to the equivalent indices in the sectors and the geographies in which we invest.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And those indices showed very similar movements in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The weighted average multiples used to value the portfolio fell to 8.",1413
18511,"2011m5","8 before discount compared to 9.",1413
18511,"2011m5","5 in March 2010.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As a result of this reduction, value growth decreased by £76 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So as we start the half year, those elements of the valuation, which directly reflect the performance of the investments, have remained strong in the second half, and notwithstanding a small number of asset-specific reductions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The unrealized value growth on our portfolio is obviously a key driver of our returns and also of a balance sheet portfolio value.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This slide shows you the progression of the portfolio value during the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The opening portfolio was £3.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This increased by £719 million of investments and the positive contribution from the revaluation of £325 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","After taking account of divestments and other movements, the closing portfolio value was £4 billion at the 31st of March 2011.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let me just spend a few minutes elaborating on that £719 million of investment in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is a significant increase, following a period of low activity levels, and is consistent with the recovery in activity levels seen in the European private equity market, which Michael will talk in more detail about shortly.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have maintained a highly selective approach to new investment, looking for investments where we believed our sector expertise and our international network could make a difference.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, the competitive environment remains, which has meant a number of transactions have had a very long lead time.",1413
18511,"2011m5","You can see from this slide, we invested £270 million in private equity.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is in 6 new deals, most of which were under our Eurofund V mandates.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We also invested in 3 new deals in our Indian Infrastructure Fund, and I would encourage you to look at the results in the presentation given by Cressida and the infrastructure team last week, which gives you plenty of detail on the progress being made there.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In addition to making new investments, we've continued to support our existing portfolio, providing £80 million of capital to fund new acquisitions and capital expenditure.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As we announced at the half year, we also invested £110 million in buying debt at a discount at existing businesses.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the cost of equity cures and capital restructurings were low at £16 million.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Capitalized interest of £158 million relates largely to the buyout portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So what effect has that and the realizations had on the makeup of our portfolio? This slide sets out the portfolio by business, geography, sector and vintage.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And it's helpful in understanding the shape of our business today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'm not going to spend any time going through this in detail, but it is clear from the analysis that the portfolio remains well diversified.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'd now like to turn to the rest of the balance sheet.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've continued to adopt a conservative approach to our balance sheet management and remain committed to our limit on net debt of £1 billion.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've also continued to make progress in reducing our gross debt.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This has fallen significantly in the period from £2.",1413
18511,"2011m5","5 billion to £2 billion, as we have bought in the convertible bond, bought back some of our 2012 maturities and took a positive decision not to refinance other debt, which has fallen due in the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","There was an increase in net debt and gearing as a result of net cash outflow in the period.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, net debt of £522 million is comfortably within our £1 billion limit.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The Group's liquidity position remains very strong 
at £1.",1413
18511,"2011m5","8 billion, meaning we're well placed to take advantage of investment and strategic opportunities as they arise.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The macroeconomic environment is still uncertain.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Whilst this prevails, our strategy is to continue to manage the balance sheet on a conservative basis.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We recognize that this has a negative effect on our returns in the short term.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We continually look for opportunities to mitigate this while maintaining flexibility for funding.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As Michael will explain shortly, it is very much our intention to deploy capital wisely, and in a way, that is consistent with our model for returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Thus in summary, we have continued to diversify the business across 3 core businesses and there has been an increase in activity across all of them.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Notwithstanding a small number of asset-specific write-downs, there has been good underlying performance in the portfolio, with stronger earnings performance across many of our portfolio companies.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the business is very well funded, with strong liquidity to take advantage of new investment opportunities to support future growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So thank you, and I will now hand back to Michael.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The best way of looking at that is if you remember the chart that Julia showed with all the different pie charts on, as Julia said, she wasn't going to go into detail in that.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But if you actually look at that chart, it gives you a very, very good overview of where the sectoral concentrations are, where the geographic concentrations are.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I think one of the reasons why we want to draw people's attention to that is we believe we've got a very, very diversified portfolio.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And what you are seeing now is that as we expand our activities on a global basis, what used to be a historic point of concentration being the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","is now becoming much less a part of our asset base.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We'll continue to invest in the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","and we've done some great deals here, as I mentioned, GO Outdoors.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But there isn't any particular area of concentration that I would mention.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But have a look at that chart, and if that doesn't answer your question, then give us a call.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the second question, just on Debt Management, to what extent is that business able to meet your return targets, assuming the status quo? Or do your targets require on further fundraisings? Well, good morning, everyone.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Today, we're going to set out the results of the Group and how each of our businesses are performing.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I want to use this results presentation to explain how our strategy is developing and give you a financial framework to assess both these results and our future performance updates.",1413
18511,"2011m5","After this brief introduction, Julia will provide a detailed financial review, and then I'll set out the market background and give you more detail on our strategy and financial objectives for the future.",1413
18511,"2011m5","These are the key messages that run through these results.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The underlying performance of each business line is positive, and we've come a very long way in 2 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Strategically, the acquisition of MIM to form a Debt Management business line is an important step forward on our growth agenda.",1413
18511,"2011m5","3i Debt Management will provide yield and lower volatility earnings.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've also reviewed our approach to investment in asset management.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've improved where necessary, for example, in bringing together our buyout and growth capital businesses, so that they might operate more effectively in the market.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I'm pleased that the benefits of this move are already showing through in an increase in investment activity.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This year, we've completed 10 high-quality transactions across our network, investing £1.",1413
18511,"2011m5","5 billion in total.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The final message reflects our commitment to manage 3i, with both strong liquidity and low leverage.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And you'll see that we're continuing to bring down absolute levels of borrowing.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Before handing over to Julia, I want to summarize the progress we've made over the past 2 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Firstly, the financial security of the company needed to be reestablished, and the steps that we took in early 2009 to restructure and de-risk the balance sheet helped us to achieve this sooner than expected.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Secondly, we needed to protect value in the portfolio, and then ensure businesses were achieving their full potential.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Thirdly, we've made important management and cultural changes to create a winning model.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And finally, we're now moving back to a growth agenda.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So let me now turn to this year's financial highlights.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Julia's going to take you through these numbers in more detail, but let me focus on 2 aspects of these results.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Total return of 10.",1413
18511,"2011m5","6% or £324 million was achieved despite an impairment in value of £198 million, in respect of a large U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","asset, which is now valued at zero.",1413
18511,"2011m5","While this write-down is disappointing, the overall results highlight the resilience of the business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And this performance was underpinned by portfolio earnings growth of 13% and good uplifts on the sale of assets at 26%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And it's this underlying strength that gives us confidence to recommend an increase of 20% in the dividend.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'm now going to hand over to Julia, who will take us through the detail behind these numbers.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But when I come back, I'll set out a very important series of ways in which we're challenging ourselves to deliver returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Daniel Garrod from Barclays Capital here.",1413
18511,"2011m5","A couple of quick questions, if I may.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I was wondering if you could give some color on those targets, the Group ROE target of 15% around the sort of the leverage that you intend to employ for the Group.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In particular, currently, I wonder if you could outline sort of £520 million net debt position, but if you included the proceeds that you've outlined from Hyva and NORMA, and perhaps if you could also include MWM, as well that you may get later in the year, what the pro forma net debt position.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I imagine, it would look much closer to sort of zero.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Is that ROE target achievable with that sort of virtually zero net debt position? Or does it require you pushing much closer to your sort of ceiling of £1 billion? Can I just ask quickly, in terms of your 3 business areas, so Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management, do you have target allocations? Or in the future, could that change significantly in terms of proportion of portfolio invested in those areas by reference to what it is now? In terms of the existing funds that we've acquired, we expect that we will be able to achieve those return targets.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But the purpose of establishing the Debt Management business is not to simply stay with the funds that we've got at the moment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","There are opportunities for further consolidation of the sector, and there are certainly very attractive opportunities over the next 2 to 5 years in terms of launching new funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the reason those opportunities exist is because the banks will struggle to fund all of the corporate debt requirement both in North America and in Europe over the next 5 years because of the regulatory capital rules that have been brought in.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the bank's exposure to some of the southern European sovereign markets will further exacerbate that position.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So Debt Management is an area that we feel very excited about and we think there are very, very strong growth prospects.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So the model is not based on sitting with what we've got at the moment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It is about growing the business further.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And do you anticipate being much closer to the £1 billion by the end of next year? Is there going to be a significant step-up? Nathan Archer here from Nomura.",1413
18511,"2011m5","For your U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","portfolio, you've obviously taken the one and specific company hit.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Can you just comment onto the read across in terms of your other investment in the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5",", please? Iain, in terms of your Growth Capital question, I think -- I mean, I think it's a very good point.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And what we have seen, particularly in Europe, is growth-orientated businesses have been relatively reluctant to actually press the button on expansion.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I mean, there's been a lot of debt aversion and a lot of aversion to actually taking new steps forward.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What we have seen though, in the last 3 to 4 months is that attitude changing.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And already in the new financial year, we've actually completed another 2 Growth Capital transactions: One in the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5",", in GO Outdoors, which is a U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","retail concept, which we're very excited about and we think has got every chance of being a real category killer; and also we've invested in a French-based international freight forwarding and management business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the pipeline for Growth Capital investments is actually the strongest it's been for a number of years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So I think it was around reticence to commit to growth by businesses, but that now seems to be fading, and we are seeing some very good opportunities.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's Andrew Bell from Witan Investment Trust.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I've got 3 questions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The first is with the significant U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","write-down, does it reflect a distressed business or simply is it a mathematical result of applying the right multiple to the business, and that just leaves nothing for the equity at the moment, but it might recover? The second is, other people who manage external funds have found that there's pressure from the fund holders to concentrate the returns on the people working for their funds, so that they're not disadvantaged.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And how are you going to make sure that the benefit, which is part -- an integral part of the returns from the lower return asset categories -- how do you ensure that you capture those benefits for 3i rather than they're being hypothecated as it were towards the people who are focused on those funds? And the third is, this admirable portfolio you've talked to us about, even after today's share price rise, is now still available on about a 17% or 18% discount.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And it'd be helpful if you could give a bit of color on your policy on the share buybacks.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I mean, one of the things we said in our preclose statement was that we were seeing a combination of different trading performances by geography and then there were some asset-specific issues.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Within the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5",", we've seen softer trading in a number of our businesses, and that's fully reflected in the results today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The businesses that have been suffering the most have been -- have tended to be ones that are domestically focused.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've got other businesses in the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've got a great business based in Yorkshire, an engineering business called AES, which has had a record turnover, record profits, because it's an engineering business, where it's exporting to India, China and the growing markets around the world.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So that's a common thing that we see, where our businesses have got a high export content to developing markets that are performing very, very well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And that's why we've seen strong business performance in the Benelux, in Nordic and in Germany, where many of the businesses that were invested have that profile.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So it's that -- the balance between domestic sales and exporting, which is probably the biggest single factor.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But clearly you're adding in one side of the equation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What we're really looking to see in the next 6 months is further investments as well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So you've got the numbers for the realization side of the equation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Just picking up your first question about uplifts to sale, yes, you're right.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I mean, the 3 principal transactions in there are Hyva, MWM and the NORMA IPO.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Hyva and NORMA completed in April.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And as I said, it was -- at the beginning of my presentation, that's actually now delivered £255 million of proceeds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","MWM is still going through competition clearance.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Thanks, Julia.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In this next section, I want to give you some background on the market, remind you of our wider strategy and introduce a model for how we generate returns, before closing with a few comments on the outlook.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let's look at our markets.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The private equity market continues to be impacted by excess capital that was raised in the peak years of 2006 to 2008, and hasn't yet been spent due to low investment over the past couple of years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We are, however, seeing investment rates begin to pick up, driven by 2 factors: firstly, a return of confidence; and secondly, the pressure on funds to invest as they move towards the end of their investment periods.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The short-term impact of this has been increased competition, which is pushing asset prices up.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, private equity fund raising remains at historically low levels.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Therefore, as investment increases and new fund raising remains low, I expect excess capital to be used up and the investment environment to improve.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As a permanent capital vehicle, 3i is well positioned to take advantage of this market dynamic.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Turning to the infrastructure market.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Pressures on public finances will increase deal flow as governments increasingly look to the private sector as a source of funding.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Such opportunities play to the strengths of 3i's brand, our reputation as a responsible investor and our ability to invest for the long term through 3i Infrastructure plc.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In India, economic development continues to drive a huge demand for India.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's estimated that over the next 5 years, $1 trillion will be invested in the sector.",1413
18511,"2011m5","3i is already recognized as a market leader in Indian infrastructure investment, which positions us well to take advantage of new opportunities through our existing and follow-on funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","With respect to Debt Management, we believe that the combined effect of Basel III [ph] and liquidity pressures in the banking sector will create attractive opportunities to invest.",1413
18511,"2011m5","These same factors are also likely to present further acquisition opportunities in both Europe and the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let me remind you of the shape of 3i today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We now have 3 businesses: Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Each business has its own return characteristics and is funded differently through a mix of 3i's own balance sheet and external funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Each is differentiated in their respective markets by the strength of 3i's brand.",1413
18511,"2011m5","They benefit from 3i's institutional model and the breadth of our international network.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our permanent capital and strong balance sheet provide a competitive advantage and flexibility in how we manage our business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And a major benefit from managing multiple asset classes is the different risk return profiles that they have.",1413
18511,"2011m5","By investing across all 3 business lines, we can improve the quality of overall returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This next chart shows the progress that the Group's made over the past 2 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've added an additional 30p to our net asset value this year, giving an annualized return of 13% over the 2 years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I want to build on this progress as we move forward.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Over the past 2 years, we've developed a clear set of priorities to deliver future growth that's consistent with our return objectives.",1413
18511,"2011m5","These priorities form the basis for the strategy summarized on this slide.",1413
18511,"2011m5","By building on the 3i brand and growing our reputation as a respected and responsible investor, we will invest in 3i itself, our business lines and investment portfolios to deliver growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We must ensure that we maintain a consistent approach to the way that we do business to drive performance, build best practice and achieve our objective of delivering consistent returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As an experienced international investment company, managing multiple sources of capital across different asset classes, I believe that we're well positioned to deliver this strategy for our shareholders and investors.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And let me expand on 2 of these areas of strategy: investment and growth of the business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Starting with investment, 3i and its funds have committed £1.",1413
18511,"2011m5","5 billion to 10 new companies over the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","These include: Eversholt, the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","train leasing company, Vedici, a private healthcare provider in France, and BVG, one of India's largest facilities management service providers.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And the one thing that all of these investments have in common is that they're in sectors and countries that we know well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","While our rates of investment has increased significantly on the previous year, we've ensured that we retain our measured and highly selective approach in what has remained a very competitive market.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The second aspect of our strategy that's been particularly relevant this year is our commitment to grow the business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our Debt Management acquisition in September, which completed in February, has added to our existing Debt Management capabilities and reinforced 3i's strategy of growing in areas consistent with our investment expertise.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Our new business line, 3i Debt Management, complements the existing private equity and infrastructure businesses, and provides a source of growing and lower volatility returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've also recently announced the recruitment of an experienced team in Brazil, led by Marcelo Di Lorenzo, the team's established track record will give us access to opportunities in one of the world's fastest-growing regions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","What's more, the global nature of 3i's portfolio means that 20% of our companies already have an exposure to Latin America.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And having a team on the ground in that region will provide the support that these companies need to grow.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In Asia, we're looking to raise a second Indian Infrastructure Fund to build on the performance of the first fund.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I hope this demonstrates the ambition that we have to grow our business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're actively pursuing further opportunities to complement our existing business and build on 3i's brand, reputation and expertise.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let me now turn to our model for returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is the framework that I'm using as a management tool to guide 3i's growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I want to spend a few moments on this next slide to explain the model.",1413
18511,"2011m5","3i now operates in 3 distinct asset classes across the risk/return spectrum: private equity, infrastructure and debt.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And although the gross returns of these investments vary, we've designed a funding structure, such that each business line contributes equally to our long term return objective of 15%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This return objective is demanding.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we're looking at it as an average over any given 5-year period.",1413
18511,"2011m5","For those business lines with lower gross return characteristics, namely infrastructure and debt, we have a higher proportion of third-party funds under management, and so receive higher fee income.",1413
18511,"2011m5","By their nature, these asset classes also benefit from more stable earnings, allowing us to deliver a greater consistency of returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let me now show you in more detail how our current business lines fit with this model.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Let's firstly take Private Equity.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is the business line that contributes the highest gross return to our portfolio to around 20%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's also the business line to which we commit the highest proportion of our own funds, at least a 50/50 split with external investors.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Overall, the net effect of costs, fees and carried interest gives us a long term net return objective of 15%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Moving on to Infrastructure.",1413
18511,"2011m5","As a lower risk asset class, our gross return objective for Infrastructure is lower than Private Equity at 12%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, since 3i manages a higher proportion of third-party capital, we see a net benefit from fee income, which contributes to an overall net return objective of 15%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And finally, turning to our new Debt Management business line, this has the highest proportion of external funds under management, and so shows the largest positive impact of external management and performance fees.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So again, a 15% return is achieved.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And so I hope you can now see how our 3 business lines work together to achieve our return objectives.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So for shareholders, our net return objective of 15% should translate into a return on equity, also of 15%.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And this is the model that I'm using to challenge each of our businesses to deliver over the long term.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Of course in each individual period, the results are likely to vary from these objectives.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But hopefully, this framework should help shareholders understand more clearly the progress that we're making.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This model also serves the dual purpose of being a tool to evaluate new areas of investment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Any new business opportunities will be tested against this framework and will need to fit with our strategy, our return objectives and enhance the overall 3i business model.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I wanted to look forward to the outlook for 3i.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In the near term, the global economic climate faces considerable uncertainty, but is likely to show overall growth.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, the regional differences will be significant.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In this environment, we will continue to focus on stock selection, and we expect to increase investment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, this will be well controlled and focused on regions and sectors where we have a competitive advantage.",1413
18511,"2011m5","3i will also continue to pursue its strategy of investing in its business and reputation.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The multi-business line structure that we now operate is designed to provide higher quality and more stable earnings for our investors.",1413
18511,"2011m5","3i is facing the future with confidence.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I hope our new framework for returns clarifies our business and provides a yardstick for future performance.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Before we turn to Q&A, let me pick up on the key messages that I hope you take from this meeting.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Firstly, we're seeing very good underlying performance of our business lines.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've taken one notable hit to performance this year in our private equity business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But this aside, all 3 business lines are performing in line with our long term return objectives.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've also made good strategic and operational progress.",1413
18511,"2011m5","The creation of 3i Debt Management will not only diversify returns for our investors, but will also provide greater yield and more stable earnings.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In addition, the operational review of our asset management techniques will ensure that we're managing our portfolio optimally and have learned from the challenges of recent years.",1413
18511,"2011m5","To provide greater insight into our businesses, we'll be holding an Investor Day on the 23rd of June, where all our senior business line leaders will be presenting an in-depth review of their businesses and key assets.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've continued to be highly selective with respect to new investment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","However, we're well positioned to take advantage of the good quality investment opportunities that are emerging, given that we're well funded and with a strong balance sheet.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Growth from here will be from a solid, financial base, and we'll be well controlled to ensure that we maintain our financial discipline.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Finally, I've introduce to you a model for returns that I intend to use to guide our performance and against which all new business opportunities will be assessed.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This will help to ensure that we're delivering increasing value for our shareholders and the investors in our funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We'll be now very happy to take questions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And you'll see from our report and accounts, we actually quantified that in terms of our attribution analysis for those transactions that we've actually sold.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think the targets, the sort of broad working metrics that we're using are not so much targeting an amount that we will have in each area, but more the funding balance.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we really want to test what the growth opportunities in each area and we're very ambitious for each of the areas and all of them can grow.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But the funding balance, I said, at least 50/50 in Private Equity.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In Infrastructure, the broad metric that we're looking at is 25% on balance sheet; 75%, third-party funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And in Debt Management, we'd expect about 10% on balance sheet; 90%, third-party funds.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So those are broad working metrics that we're operating with.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Well, thank you all very much for coming.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Julia and I are available for the rest of the day, and indeed, over the next few weeks.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're going to be talking to many of our shareholders.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So we'd be very happy to take any further questions outside this session.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But thank you very much for coming today.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Well, I mean, we've had -- received £325 million of additional realization so far.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So you're not 1 million miles out if you say it was about £253 million at the moment.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It really does depend on the opportunities.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I mean, what we have seen certainly in terms of what we're targeting around realizations, we've got off to a great start in, if you like, front-end loaded our budget on realizations.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That gives us great flexibility if we want to step up investments because we're seeing good opportunities to do so.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But certainly, as you saw from the increased investment during the last financial year, we are looking to see growing levels of investment compared to what we've seen historically.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So what we say is we will operate within that £1 billion net debt limit.",1413
18511,"2011m5","If we go up to it, because we've seen great investment opportunities, well, that's fine.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But equally, as you've seen in the last couple of years, we've operated well below that.",1413
18511,"2011m5","This is Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I've got a couple.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Firstly, on the imminent sale gain number, I mean, that was particularly strong.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I was wondering if you could just give us a bit more color on that.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Presumably that includes things like the £60 million gain ahead of the NORMA IPO.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Then I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the investment rate within the Growth Capital business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I'm just sort of perplexed, given how low that figure is.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think it was around about £70 million for the year.",1413
18511,"2011m5","Well, let me try and answer all of those questions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I mean, in terms of the large U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","asset, of which there's clearly a lot more detail in the statements that we released today, to address your specific point, the underlying performance of that asset, it is a robust business.",1413
18511,"2011m5","It's a business with over £1 billion turnover with over a £16 million operating profit, and its got an order book of over £5 billion.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So on an operational level, the business is performing well.",1413
18511,"2011m5","But it's a business that serves the U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","public sector.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And therefore, it's faced the headwinds of U.",1413
18511,"2011m5","public sector cuts.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And as a result of what we see as the lower growth trajectory of that business, we've used a lower earnings multiple to value it.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So that, combined with flat or slightly decreasing earnings, together with a very highly leveraged structure that was put in place at the time of our own original investment, means that the write-down that we're talking about is, as you put it, Andrew, a mathematical result of our valuation policy.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we've taken that asset down to zero.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're working very hard with the company.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've changed the Chairman and the Chief Executive.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We've reorganized the business to face the new market conditions.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So is it possible that the value of that business will come back in due course? The answer to that is, we would hope to see some value recovery and we're certainly working towards that.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of your second question, around the share of rewards between employees of a financial business and the shareholders of the financial business, I think actually 3i has managed over the years to strike quite a good balance in that our teams recognize they benefit from the brand, the permanent capital, our market reach, to be able to access great investment opportunities whether in any of our business lines.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And therefore, the sharing of rewards between the employees and the shareholders, I think, is in a form that is unlikely to be shifted dramatically.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And we're certainly not seeing the pressure that you talk about for a particular move in that direction.",1413
18511,"2011m5","In terms of the share price right now compared to the NAV, I mean, again, mathematically, you're absolutely right.",1413
18511,"2011m5","You were absolutely right on the figure.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I'm sure you hear lots of chief executives who bemoan where their share price is.",1413
18511,"2011m5","There aren't that many FTSE100 chief executives whose share price is trading at a 17% discount to hard assets.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So I think my grievance around might be slightly more credible.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think though the critical thing for us is one, deliver on the return on equity targets; and two, actually use the framework I've described today to help more people understand 3i, what our business model is and how we're going to deliver returns.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I think if we get that right, I think the share price will take care of itself.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So what we're focused on as a management team is delivering those return on equity objectives.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And right now, we are seeing plenty of opportunities to deploy capital at the kind of returns I talked about.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And I think that will be in the longer-term interest of shareholders rather than actually reducing the size of the overall business through buybacks.",1413
18511,"2011m5","I think, I mean, going forward, we are planning to, as Julia said very clearly, adopt a very conservative funding strategy.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have a net debt limit at the moment of £1 billion, which clearly as the net asset value grows, that becomes an even more and more conservative limit.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And obviously, we're nowhere near that as of the 31st of March.",1413
18511,"2011m5","And as you quite rightly point out, the additional realizations that have come in already in the last 6 weeks mean that we're actually -- that net debt figure has come down even further.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We're not assuming that we get any benefit from leverage in the target that we're setting.",1413
18511,"2011m5","So we have not set these targets on the basis of let's increase leverage as a helping hand.",1413
18511,"2011m5","We have leverage in the business and we run cash balances really to give us the flexibility to have capital available to deploy at a moment's notice.",1413
18511,"2011m5","That's what we're focused on around our balance sheet management as opposed to having structural leverage that will enhance our returns.",1413
18511,"2012m11","Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The results we reported this morning is solid evidence of the progress we're making in the strategic initiatives that Simon has just outlined.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we've achieved those results against the challenging economic environment in which we all continue to operate.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Fundamental, political, regulatory and financial questions remained unanswered in Europe and beyond.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Equity markets have been up and down during the 6 months.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But in the markets and the sectors where we've operated, they've ended up broadly flat.",1095
18511,"2012m11","M&A activity has been muted.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There have been some signs of improvement more recently, but it will take time for any improvement to have an impact on our activity levels.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And finally, as a sterling investor, currency markets have also proved challenging with weakness in the euro and the rupee being particularly relevant for us.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So against that backdrop, here are our key financial, starting with the returns on our income statement.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The performance for the 6 months reflects a period of considerable change in development in 3i, but we have a degree of stability, returning to the underlying portfolio performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Gross portfolio return of GBP 180 million reflects good realizations in the noncore portfolio in the first quarter, better earnings performance in a big part of the Private Equity portfolio compared to last year and that GBP 180 million is a marked improvement on the loss of GBP 329 million in the year to 31st of March.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Fees in the period reduced a GBP 36 million and that reflects the end of the investment period for Eurofund V, our most European buyout bond, but we had another strong period of Debt Management.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Operating costs are GBP 105 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That GBP 105 million includes the effect of implementing the changes to the business, which we announced in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We estimated then that implementation cost will be about GBP 30 million, and we have provided for GBP 25 million in this period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have made tangible progress in a relatively short time since the changes were announced in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We are on track to achieve the run rate savings of GBP 40 million that Simon talked about by the end of this financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In a minute, I'll outline the composition of the resulting net portfolio return of GBP 109 million by individual business line.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The total return takes account of the effects of our balance sheet and was a small loss of GBP 5 million compared to a GBP 656 million was at the 31st of March.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We accounted for the payment of the final dividend when it was paid in July and that dividend payment, together with a total return, is rise to an NAV, at GBP 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","73 at the 31st of September.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So how is that NAV progressed during the period? 
Opening NAV of GBP 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","79 was reduced by 5p for the final dividend.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Implementation costs and the effects of the gross debt reduction gave rise to further reductions of 3p and 2p, respectively.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Noncash FX, pension and other items was 6p.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As a result, underlying business performance contributed a 10p improvement.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we closed an NAV of GBP 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Now I'd like to talk about that underlying business performance in some more detail.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Each of our Infrastructure, Debt Management and Private Equity businesses have contributed to the total net portfolio return of GBP 109 million as you can see here.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The sharp item you'll notice that the 3 business lines don't actually add up to the total.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The difference is our noncore portfolio, and it's not usually so material.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But in this period, the sale of EUSA Pharma, which is a former bench capital asset generated cash proceeds of GBP 72 million, an uplift of GBP 42 million over the opening book value and a money multiple of 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That's an excellent result but I don't expect it to be repeated by the noncore business, which now accounts for only 2% of the portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As you've seen from Simon's presentation, we've made good progress on implementing changes we announced in June to reduce the complexity of the group and cut our cost base.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Simon just said we announced 160 people would be leaving the business by the end of this financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Headcount at the end of the period was down by 104, so we remain on track to meet our run rate target reduce cost by GBP 40 million as we start the next financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And as you can expect with regards next year to be the same level as last year, so we're talking about GBP 180 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","All these figures are before adjusting for Debt Management acquisitions in the period, but those incremental costs are more than covered by the fees the new businesses will generate.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So taking each principal business line in turn.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our Infrastructure team manages GBP 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","6 billion of assets under management, 30% of that or GBP 471 million is on 3i's balance sheet so the contribution that we get is generated by a blended capital returns and fees, net of cost.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The business has had another solid period, supported by the robust performance of its European portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","However, the solid performance was offset by the performance of the Indian portfolio, where the political, currency and sector conditions are more challenging.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In group terms, this performance translates into an increase of GBP 6 million in the value of our 34% share of 3i Infrastructure plc, unrealized value decreases of GBP 8 million in the Indian portfolio and dividend income of GBP 9 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","During the period, the group sold its investment in Networks.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We had invested alongside 3i Infrastructure last year to facilitate the completion of the deal.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And by the way, that's a good example of the benefit our permanent capital brings.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So now we sold our position at a gain, GBP 1 million gain, over the opening portfolio value.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our Debt Management business is capital-light but it's an important fee generator for the group.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It's performed well, again with fees from the original European business remaining ahead of plan, and they are now being supplemented by fees from the funds that we acquired from Invesco in August.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have further increased assets under management by our strategic partnership with Fraser Sullivan, which you've heard about from Simon.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The return impacts of this last transaction is actually minimal in this period because the deal was only signed on the 28th of September.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Private Equity remains the most important contributor to our performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Today, it accounts for 80% of our portfolio and 47% of total assets under management, and that's why progress we have made on the assets management initiatives outlined by Simon are so critical.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Before going through the detail of the related gross portfolio return, I'd like to comment briefly on other aspects of the business' performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Fees have stepped down in the first half.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Eurofund V investment period ended in November 2011, just a year ago.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And fees in our paid on invested capital rather than committed capital.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The operating expenses of GBP 73 million include GBP 22 million of the GBP 25 million implementation costs.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Investments of GBP 131 million is lower than last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It includes the completions of Gecko, the final reinvestments from Eurofund V and Blue Interactive, the first investment made by our Brazil team.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The M&A market has been quiet through most of the period, and we have stayed cautious about new investment in Europe.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We generated realization proceeds of GBP 165 million at the, at an uplift over opening value of 15.",1095
18511,"2012m11","4%, and that represents an aggregate money multiple of 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","9x, generating realized profits of GBP 22 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've given much more detail about realizations during the period in our announcement today, and in the appendix to the slides.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In Private Equity, it is worth noting that the disposal of Esmalglass, the Spanish investment, was sold at a small uplift over the March value.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And at a money multiple of 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The Spanish portfolio now accounts for just 5% of the group's total.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The next slide gives you a picture of the diversity of the Private Equity portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","From a geographic perspective, our strongest performers continue to be in Northern Europe and in the Americas.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Those regions make up 58% of the portfolio and have generated GBP 52 million of value growth in that period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There is a small number of assets in Europe, which are more challenging, and we're cautious about the outlook for the French portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The French portfolio is now valued at GBP 216 million or 7% of the total.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The more recent vintages now account for 30% of the total portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Performance is not uniformly positive.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But it's in those vintages from 2010 onwards that we've seen some very positive earnings growth, with corresponding uplifts in value in the period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The 2007 to 2009 vintages were more stable in this period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Their accounting for 66% of the portfolio and generating a value increase of GBP 53 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Now in the past, we provided additional disclosure to give you a view on the trajectory of portfolio performance, taking accounts of commercial considerations and confidentiality obligations, and it's fair to say with varying degrees of success.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This slide gives an indicator of performance on an aggregate basis by comparing earnings performance versus the prior year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The blue line shows you the percentage by number of companies you have better earnings performance than last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So for the portfolio at 30th of September, just over 55% of companies are better, and they account for 70% of the value and that's the steady performance since March.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Breaking this picture down to a company level, this slide gives an indication of the performance of our largest assets.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This is a positive picture, with a significant majority performance ahead of last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And you'll see from the additional information in the announcement, 35% of companies had growth of more than 10%, 24% of companies generated growth of more than 20%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So overall, the performance of the portfolio is better than it has been in our most recent periods.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And that's improved portfolio performance is reflected in the valuations in the first half.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As I mentioned earlier, even though equity markets have been volatile, they actually finished broadly flat in the period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And the multiples used to value the portfolio were also similarly flat, increasing by only 1%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","For this reporting period, we typically use the last 12 months accounts to June as a basis of valuation, but we use forecast earnings if they're lower than the last 12 months to June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And 16 companies, 27%, were valued using current year forecast earnings.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Aggregate earnings used to value the portfolio, including those on forecast, grew by 1%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But on valuated basis, earnings used to value the portfolio, grew by 9%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And as you might expect, the leverage in the portfolio of using earnings fell to 3.",1095
18511,"2012m11","3x net-debt-to-EBITDA multiple, that's thanks to better performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So bringing beast data points together into the makeup of the unrealized value for the GBP 66 million, you can see that the most material component relates to performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The positive small movements GBP 4 million in provisions is the net effect of 3 companies, each movements being less than GBP 10 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And so that's not indicative of the wider trend.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Finally, the industry metric category includes ATR, our Asian reinsurance business, which continues to be impacted by the effects of the Thai floods at the end of 2011.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Turning then to the balance sheet and, in particular, to the gross debt reduction and the capital allocation model that Simon talked about earlier.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Keeping our strategic review we just completed was to reduce the gross debt by using our cash resources.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have been reducing debt since its peak of GBP 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","7 billion in March 2009, but it's the simplification of the business model and more direct central control that mean we can take the next significant steps.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We started the year with GBP 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","6 billion of gross debt and sets target to reduce its GBP 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","3 billion by the 30th of September and then reduce it further to GBP 1 billion by June 2013.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Gross deb at the end of the period was GBP 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","2 billion, so we are ahead of our intermediate target.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've done that through a combination of scheduled maturities but also by being opportunistic in making some early repayments.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Gross interest for the period of GBP 60 million includes GBP 20 million of accelerated interest costs.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I expect that the full year charge will be marginally less than last financial year and, importantly, that the run rate of net interest payable at the start of next year will be near at GBP 60 million for the full year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we are ahead of our original plan.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And I'm confident that we're on track to meet the GBP 1 billion target by June 2013.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This is particularly important.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It's not only important because of the impact on the run rate of interest but also because of its link to our capital allocation and distribution policy.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The target capital allocation framework that we set out in June, which Simon has just restated, means we will deploy more of our capital to shareholder distribution and to investment in our core businesses over time.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The quality of realizations in the period has been good, but as we had expected, lower in absolute terms than in prior years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That reduction and realizations, together with a significant progress we're making to reduce gross debt means that there is a net outflow of GBP 390 million in the period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Of course, repayments of gross debt has no impact on net debt or gearing.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Net debt increased only marginally from GBP 464 million to GBP 493 million and gearing went from 18% to 19%, that's another important factor in our capital distribution policy.",1095
18511,"2012m11","To remind you what we set out in May, we rebased our dividend to 8.",1095
18511,"2012m11","1p per share this time last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we defined the basis of aggregate shareholders distributions as 15% to 20% of gross cash proceeds from realizations, provided that gearing is less than 20% and that we're on target to have gross debt less than GBP 1 billion by June 2013.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We also indicated that realizations are likely to be lower in this financial year, and the first half performance is consistent with our lower forecast.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Therefore, it's still the case but it will be next financial year before you should expect any meaningful increase in shareholder distribution.",1095
18511,"2012m11","1p levels set last year should be seen as a base for the dividend.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we announced today, an interim dividend of 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","7p per share, with an intention to pay 8.",1095
18511,"2012m11","1p per share as the total dividend for the year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So before I hand back to Simon to wrap up, I'll just quickly summarize the results for the 6 months of the 30th of September 2012.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This has been a period of very considerable change.",1095
18511,"2012m11","A lot of which is reflected in the numbers and some of which will take longer to prove its potential.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've made good progress in restructuring the business and we've seen a degree of stability in the underlying performance of the portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The total return loss of GBP 5 million reflects its better performance from our Private Equity portfolio and steady contributions from Infrastructure and Debt Management, as well as the cost of restructuring.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The balance sheet remains strong, and the progress that we've made in reducing gross debt will improve returns and cash flow from next year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","All of this has created a leaner business and prepares us for increased shareholder distributions as the level of our realizations improved.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I'll now hand back to Simon.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Thanks, Julia.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to conclude the presentation with a few key messages.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As I said earlier, we've had a busy period over the last 6 months, and I think we've made great progress on the restructuring in the business against a very difficult macro conditions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We're on track to meet the cost and the debt reduction targets that we set out in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our overall financial performance has been stable, with a better performance from Private Equity and steady contributions from Infrastructure and our Debt Management business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We're focusing on the next stage of our strategic plan, transition and delivery, which covers financial years 2014 and 2015.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Transition and delivery will be about aligning our cost to our income, shifting our capital allocation and growing third-party fee income.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As part of that, I expect our pipeline of realizations in Private Equity to come through over the next 2 years and to support enhanced shareholders distributions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So those are our key messages and they identify our priorities and how we would like to be measured over the next few years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","With that in mind, we'd now be delighted to take some Q&A.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We got some mics so.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And then on your question about provision impairments, I think as we talked about in the past, our provision numbers should really be low because we make a provision when we actually have a fear that the investment may fail.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we will anticipate negative performance to reduce forecast earnings.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So I think it will be a bit premature to find some correlation now between that number and the dashboard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Having said that, I'm confident that the dashboard will absolutely help our ability to anticipate any issues in the value that needs to be dealt with, and that you'd expect that to flow through the valuations in time.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",1095
18511,"2012m11","First question referring to earnings.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Can you talk about the change between March and June and in June and September? I think there's real potential for our country around Brazil.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've been approached by a number of LPs who made that inquiry and as we have a well-regarded team in Brazil.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've made our first investment.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've got a number of other proposals in the pipeline that are being considered at the moment, and it is a much more resilient economy than we see in Europe at the moment across Continental Europe, in particular, with pretty strong government finances and a very developing consumer society within the country.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we're looking hard at that.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We don't anticipate anything developing of that type before the second half of next year but it will be a serious consideration going into next year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Daniel Garrod, Barclays.",1095
18511,"2012m11","First you mentioned the actions you were taking on the realization side to ensure that next year there is a step-up in realizations, so I'm wondering if you could provide any color of that to what degree it is relying on sort of primary markets improving obviously in this sort of period relatively low level of realized profits and realizations overall.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Is it just out sort of a vintage of the portfolio that it's that much more optimal to divest next year? Second question, minimal sort of provisions and impairment going through the unrealized movement this period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","How sort of sustainable do you feel that is? You touched on this implementation at the dashboard, has that helped in any way achieve that, or is it coincidence that you actually have a product of how the portfolio has been performing, you have minimal provisions in impairments? Did you see it contributing to lower provision impairments going forward were the just the dashboard that will contribute to earlier recognition? Yes, I think we saw similar profile with slightly better performance in the our second quarter over the first half.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But clearly, the number of forecast earnings we have did also go up in that period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There's a timing issue with that, as companies go to that calendar year end.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So yes, it's consistent with the overall shape of the half.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Okay, let me try and tackle those.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In terms of comp, we're it's taking out of trunk of comp through the restructuring, so we're losing 1/3 of our staff so that is really taking down that number.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In terms of the balance, it's going to be very aligned to the returns of the group is making itself so that will determine the size of the overall conversation pool and then the division of that pool will be much between the strong performers and the weaker performers.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So I would anticipate some people earning more than at the moment and some people earning considerably less and the variable pay will be used in that regard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And when we issue shares as deferred compensation to I'm sure people build a stake in the business, we'll make sure that, that's non-dilutive so any shares issued as part of that will be brought back in, in the market.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I think in terms of realizations given the state of the world, I don't want to be led in anything in that regard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But all the mix of companies that are being put up to sale, some of them are in response to a purchase to us and it's harder to make a judgment about those sorts of prices.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But the ones that we are managing and our promoting ourselves, we feel very confident about that saleability.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And the last one, ROE.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That was a target from another management team.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I'm still trying to work out the best way to be judged in this business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I have much greater focus on cash and on cash-in-cash returns and I would expect to talk in detail, about how will be presenting their group going forward once we've 
completed the restructuring so those sorts of returns and measures will be up radical part of that.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Henry Freeman from Investec Securities.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We read in the press of the weekend about a potential raise in for Private Equity in Brazil.",1095
18511,"2012m11","What is the potential obviously you've taken us specifically on management businesses in Infrastructure and Debt Management.",1095
18511,"2012m11","What is the potential for a South American raise? Julia, why don't you do with the multiples question.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And often, the companies that already that are taking forecast earnings often got the lower values and it's a continuation of that strategy but not in all cases.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I think on the portfolio review, I'm comfortable with where the thing is valued.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You've seen from the reallocation total in the release today, that effectively made realizations of the head of the marks we have in our books.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There are a good spread of companies.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I guess the concerning thing is that the overwhelming majority of the investment is in Europe.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We see 2013 being pretty tricky in Europe for all sorts of reasons, and that would affect some of the northern European countries.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And the country we are worried about is France.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we will see some headwinds in that regard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But in general, we're very comfortable with the general state of the portfolio but a well-known problem that you all know that but apart from that, the bulk of the value is really in some pretty good companies.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Actually, if you split our multiple movement sort of our first quarter, second quarter, there was more of an uptick in the multiples in the second quarter.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So nothing consistent with the Q3 movement that market has But if you do look at the multiple movements for the 6 months as a whole, actually, markets have been pretty flat over that period of time.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We do spend quite less time trying to go through those comparative sets relating to the geographies that we're in, and I feel pretty comfortable it's pretty much in line.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Let me take the first and Julia can take the second.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I think on realizations, we have a number of initiatives in train where it takes about 6 to 9 months to sell a company from agreeing with management to plan for the exit, appointing advisers and putting together the process that leads to a successful sale.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we've started that in a number of cases, and we started that with companies that, we then, for varying degrees of time but are all at a point where they can be sold effectively in markets that don't have to be as robust as they are now and give the buyer a further traction to hold those investments going forward, so another leg to the story.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we've identified those businesses.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You're read about some of them in the press.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We haven't confirmed any of them yet, but those processes are kicking off, and we would expect to see the results of them in calendar 2013.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I think it's a metric that's sort, it's a bit meaningless if you are cash investor in the business, so I place less emphasis on it than perhaps you do.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But we'll be more explicit about the way the judge in May.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Any more questions? Okay.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Well, I'd like to wrap it up.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Thanks for your attendance and mingle at the end if you want to ask anything in private.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Yes, and although you had quite high proportion presumably quite a low proportion of the valuation based on those forward earnings? Henry over here.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And I mean, just bearing in mind sort of cautious comments on Europe, can you give any favor of how you might expect earnings to develop? Iain Scouller from Oriel securities.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I've got a couple.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Firstly on multiples.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You saw GBP 4 million gain between March and September.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Can you just talk about what that meant was between June and September because, I think, over that period the small-cap index up about 10%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","MidCap was up about 7%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We don't seem to seen much impact from multiples over that period, so maybe business mix or maybe you've taken cost approach? And then the second one is on the portfolio review that you've carried out, Simon.",1095
18511,"2012m11","What would you see are the key strengths and weaknesses of the portfolio particularly with regards to the industry mix and any other factors? Okay, I think everyone's through.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to 3i's results presentation.",1095
18511,"2012m11","For most of the last 10 years, 3i have relied on using part of the firm's capital gains from investment sales to pay for a significant part of the group's annual running costs.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Well, that was workable in the buoyant years of the mid-northeast.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That approach never made any real financial sense.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And the recent years using capital gains to fund our operating costs has led to a hollowing out of the firm's capital, because high operating cost and interest costs have made a very poor capital returns performance even worse at the bottom line.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've had a busy 6 months restructuring the group and reversing this approach, as well as introducing a number of new asset management initiatives across our Private Equity business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The journey has just begun but we've made a strong start in some tough macroeconomic conditions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And today, I'd like to give you an update on our progress on that redirected journey.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I'd also like to reinforce my confidence in the next steps we're taking on the road to recovery.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our strategic goal hasn't changed.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We remain focused on managing third-party and proprietary capital across our 3 investment platforms.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our target is to deliver top quartile returns.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And while each business is at a different point in its development, and faces different specific challenges, our vision and our strategy are clear.",1095
18511,"2012m11","3i have stumbled badly over the past few years, and there was a fair degree of confusion and doubt in the organization when I arrived late last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Not only was earning coherent between what the group was trying to do and what it could afford to do, but the investment record in Private Equity was suffering badly from a very mixed portfolio of investments made at the top of the cycling calendar years 2007 and 2008.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The group was also struggling with the challenge of managing a decentralized organization, that had investment teams spread across a lot of different geographies and the lack of control and consistency which that produced.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Putting this right is no quick fix and delivering on our strategic goal will take some time.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But putting our house in order, realizing our existing portfolio of Private Equity investments and recovering our reputation in investment and asset management should deliver significant rewards for shareholders in the coming years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Before I take you through our actions over the last few months, I'd like to remind you of my assessment of 3i's underperformance, which I set out in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","3i have spread its resources too thinly and created a very broad international platform, encompassing many different investment teams that was little central control, and results suffered from a high level of inconsistency.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The Private Equity portfolio was, in many cases, not managed as closely or as actively as it should've been and suffered from that material overinvestment in 2007 and 2008 at the very top of the cycle.",1095
18511,"2012m11","3i had lots of different controls and limits but it had no annual vintage limit on its own balance sheet investments.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In other words, there was no cap on how much the investment teams could invest each year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have now put in place an annual vintage control policy.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It not only includes the limits of the amount we invest in our balance sheet in a given year but it's also used in conjunction with our annual budgeting process and we'll review it quarterly in the Executive Committee.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And as I said earlier, operating costs were far greater than the group's annual cash income that we generate from management fees and the portfolio itself.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The group did not appear to me to be operating as a normal commercial business and seemed to lack the very disciplines it routinely demanded of its investing companies.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So my priorities for this financial year are to restructure the business and bring a much greater degree of control and focus to our asset management activities.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I want us to work at the same levels of consistency and discipline as the best organizations in our sector.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have individuals and individual teams that do exactly that, but we don't do it consistently across the group.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The restructuring of the business is on track.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've already reduced headcount by over 100 people, and we're on track to meet our target reduction of 160 by the end of this financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we've closed 5 offices.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And with the sale of Birmingham, that will complete in January, we will have met our target of 6 office closures.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We're also well underway to achieving a run rate operating cost savings of GBP 40 million by March next year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That's against our baseline annualized run rate operating cost of GBP 185 million at March this year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In June, we also announced 6 asset management improvement initiatives, which had been developed with our Private Equity teams during my 6 months as 3i CIO.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That program of initiatives has been substantially implemented and will have a significant positive impact on the performance to our portfolio over the coming years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You will recall that they involve changes to our investment review process and exit strategy and planning, as well as a review of our people strategy in terms of governance and resourcing.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The next slide illustrates one of these 6 initiatives, a subject I call the dashboard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","When I joined 3i in October last year, I was concerned that the number of instances where the group only seem to recognize series performance issues and invest companies very late in the day.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I was also surprised that the infrequent flow of realtime financial information on key portfolio of companies to the senior executives of the group.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Again, I felt the group fell some way short of best practice in the Private Equity sector and that could only be partially explained by the size and breadth of the portfolio at 3i.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So using some of my prior experience, I instigated a project with the Private Equity team to bring our monitoring and performance tracking up to best in class.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We brought in Bain and Company and together, we designed the dashboard for each of our material Private Equity investments.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The dashboard focused on strategic financial and operational KPIs, as well as presenting relevant commentary on the specific company and its performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It also give an assessment of its cash flow and its debt position.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Each dashboard is now produced within 3 weeks of monthly management accounts and sent around on an email to the Investment Committee and the senior partners in our Private Equity business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There is then the review meeting when we look of the portfolios performance once a month, and it's now very easy to use the KPI information to set the agenda for that meeting.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So that we focus on the companies with performance issues.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We then agree the actions to take and review the follow-up at the next meeting.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In my view, this initiative is transforming the effectiveness of 3i's monitoring and performance tracking.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So that we now have a system, which is timely and truly best in class.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It's been a busy and stretching 6 months for everyone at 3i.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It's been tough on those people who have been asked to leave, but it's also been very tough on those people who have stayed.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And all of this has been happening against the backdrop of some very unhelpful macroeconomic conditions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I'm confident we will deliver both the restructuring I've been talking about, as well as the asset management initiatives that will lift our investment performance in due course.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So in my view, it's time for us to focus on the next part of our recovery plan, transition and delivery.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The transition and delivery will span financial years ending March 2014 and March 2015.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we'll focus on aligning our operating costs to our income.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It will also include a hard look at our capital allocation and the growth in third-party fee income.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The aggressive restructuring steps we are taking this year and next are part of an overall plan to bring our operating costs below our cash income on an annual basis.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We are doing this ahead of time when our third-party private fee -- Private Equity fee income is reducing as the funds themselves run off.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But it's also a time when we are seeing opportunities for growth in third-party fee income from Debt Management and from Infrastructure.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our goal will be to have a healthy surplus each year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You will all be familiar with this slide, which I used in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It shows, in concept, where we are moving to as a result of our actions and our cost in our reduction in gross debt levels and it highlights the significant potential we have for increasing shareholder distributions, as well as reinvestment in our business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This sum up, we launched a review of compensation across the group.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Compensation is our largest cost at around 60% of total annual operating costs and was not part of the cost reduction program we announced in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Compensation will be a key tool in delivering our new strategic objectives.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we've got to be absolutely sure that there is a fair balance of returns between employees and shareholders.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've adopted some key principles as part of that review.",1095
18511,"2012m11","An equitable split of returns between employees and shareholders.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we acknowledge that due to performance issues, we haven't always have that balance over the last few years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We plan to align compensation with our strategic objectives and make sure these objectives have an important influence on variable compensation, in particular.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Merits will play a more prominent role in variable compensation decisions, which will have a much greater spread from top to bottom than they have had in the past at 3i.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we'll make sure there is a clear link between overall compensation and shareholder returns.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That will mean that a greater proportion of our senior staff compensation will be in deferred shares to increase alignment with shareholders and the concept of ownership across the key managers in the group.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We plan to involve shareholders in this group-wide review and use the meetings following these results to gain feedback on these key compensation principles.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Early next year, the board intends to enter a formal shareholder consultation period led by Jonathan, the Chairman of our Remuneration Committee, with a view to seeking any necessary approvals in next summer CGM.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That way, these changes will be locked in for our next financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Turning to the subject of third-party fee income, I'd like to start with Infrastructure.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have a very strong capability in Infrastructure investing.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we see good opportunities to grow both assets under management and third-party fee income over the coming years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We believe there will be increasing opportunities for private investment in government-related assets, as government finances become even more challenged.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we expect to see opportunities to take over management contracts as some existing Infrastructure funds.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Turning to Debt Management.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The team have enjoyed a busy and successful start to this financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Not only as Jeremy Ghose team acquired management contracts in Europe from Invesco and set the U.",1095
18511,"2012m11","platform with Fraser Sullivan, but they've also successfully launched their first 3i CLO fund in the U.",1095
18511,"2012m11",", adding $450 million of funds under management.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Again, like with Infrastructure, we believe that Debt Management is capable of good growth in third-party fee income in AUM over the medium term.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Fraser Sullivan has an excellent reputation in the U.",1095
18511,"2012m11","debt markets and they are well placed to take advantage of the confident market conditions in the U.",1095
18511,"2012m11","to grow their core CLO business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We should also be able to develop into adjacent debt markets.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The males will be further bolt-on acquisitions in the U.",1095
18511,"2012m11",", opportunities to accelerate our development of third-party fee income and to grow the AUM further.",1095
18511,"2012m11","However, the debt market in Europe remains fairly muted.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We need to continue to manage our existing funds effectively, as well as focusing on those products and capabilities that will position us well as the European market dynamics change.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This could take a number of routes as the banks pullback.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In terms of Private Equity over the last 6 months, realization levels and investment activity have been low, not least because of acquired M&A markets and the continuing tricky macro conditions across Europe.",1095
18511,"2012m11","However, we've made some good realizations in the first half, including Esmalglass in Spain and we exited EUSA Pharma from our noncore Private Equity portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In today's world, investment is not just about buying a strong business and loading it up with leverage.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our investment thesis invariably involves a growth or turnaround transformation, which can involve significant operational change.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And this is the most challenging part of our investment plans.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Things rarely stay right on plan.",1095
18511,"2012m11","They almost always move off either up or down.",1095
18511,"2012m11","When they move the wrong way off plan, we have to move quickly to write the situation, and we now have a much better monitoring tool to do that.",1095
18511,"2012m11","One have moved off plan in recent times, and we know focus on returning both of these to a better trajectory.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But it swings in roundabouts, an action, for example, which is our biggest Private Equity investment has moved ahead far more quickly than we anticipated.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And in these sorts of cases, we've got to remain vigilant to make sure our plan and our management are ambitious enough.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have a number of specific strategic priorities to keep us fully occupied over the next 18 months and you'll be able to judge our performance against these priorities.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In particular, you'll be able to observe an increased level of realization activity from our Private Equity portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In turn, that will lead to enhanced shareholder distributions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've already set in train preparation, which will underpin this realization activity.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And as I said earlier, this is a journey covering 3 distinct phases, and it's important to me that we increase transparency so that you can track our progress.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So in addition to the specific targets that we set out in June, we will be providing more detail on our cash income and our run rate operating costs from March next year, as well as further disclosure on all realizations, including cash profit and cash-on-cash multiples for realization.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You know the shape of 3i today, but this is how we expect to see the group evolve over the medium term.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Clearly, as I've said, we'll have an emphasis on growth in third-party funds and fee income in both Infrastructure and Debt Management.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Proprietary capital will continue to play a significant role in our Private Equity business, but we will be deploying more of our shareholders' funds in our 2 less cyclical divisions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In time, we've got to change the way the market looks at 3i.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We sit somewhere between the large-scale asset managers in the U.",1095
18511,"2012m11","such as Blackstone and KPR and the investment trust of SVG and HG Capital.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As we complete our restructuring, our objective is that the market not only values our investments but also values the profits we generate, especially as fund managers across our 3 investment platforms.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I'd now like to pass to Julia who will take you through our interim results.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Bruce Hamilton, Morgan Stanley.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Three sort of follow-up questions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Firstly, on the cost.",1095
18511,"2012m11","When you talk about comp, should we read that as meaning a further reduction in cost, or is it really more of sort of about alignment and making sure the right people get paid.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Secondly, on realizations, I recognized obvious either companies look like they're ready for sale next financial year, but I mean would you regard the 15% uplift you just enjoyed as being a sort of a good number for next year, or something that you'll be pretty disappointed with, because you can sell assets but what's the price? And then finally, on the return on equity, obviously, you previous sort of targets of 15%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The cost reduction plan to dig here the balance sheet obviously helped but you're still clearly some way off making your cost of equity.",1095
18511,"2012m11","What do you think is would be a plausible sort of ROE sort of run rate looking 2 years out when you got the business back to towards its full run rate? But I guess I suspect the market will continue to extend the return on equity versus your cost of equity.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So what you mean on managing fully focus on that internally.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Did you think he recognized that will be quite an important output in terms of way valuations or do you think that's the wrong metric? Well, I think, as Simon has just said, we are reasonably cautious about the European environment.",1095
18511,"2012m11","By using the forecast earnings we're trying to anticipate some of that, but we're not taking any further forward at the end of September.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we will all have to see how the European environment develops over the turn of the calendar year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Julia, why don't you do with the multiples question, first.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Okay, I think everyone's through.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to 3i's results presentation.",1095
18511,"2012m11","For most of the last 10 years, 3i had relied on using part of the firm's capital gains from investment sales to pay for a significant part of the group's annual running costs.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Well, that was workable in the buoyant years of the Mid-Northeast.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That approach never made any real financial sense.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In the recent years, using capital gains to fund our operating costs, has led to a hollowing out of the firm's capital, because high operating costs and interest costs have made a very poor capital returns performance, even worse at the bottom line.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've had a busy 6 months restructuring the group and reversing this approach, as well as introducing a number of new asset management initiatives across our Private Equity business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The journey has just begun, but we've made a strong start in some tough macroeconomic conditions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And today, I'd like to give you an update on our progress on that redirected journey.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I'd also like to reinforce my confidence in the next steps we're taking on the road to recovery.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our strategic goal hasn't changed.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We remain focused on managing third party and proprietary capital across our 3 investment platforms.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our target is to deliver top quartile returns.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And while each business is at a different point in its development, and faces different specific challenges, our vision and our strategy are clear.",1095
18511,"2012m11","3i had stumbled badly over the past few years, and there was a fair degree of confusion and doubt in the organization when I arrived late last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Not only was there an incoherence between what the group was trying to do and what it could afford to do, but the investment record in Private Equity was suffering badly from a very mixed portfolio of investments made at the top of the cycling calendar, years 2007 and 2008.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The group was also struggling with the challenge of managing a decentralized organization, that had investment teams spread across a lot of different geographies and the lack of control and consistency, which that produced.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Putting this right is no quick fix and delivering our strategic goal will take some time.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But putting our house in order, realizing our existing portfolio of Private Equity investments and recovering our reputation in investment and asset management should deliver significant rewards for shareholders in the coming years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Before I take you through our actions over the last few months, I'd like to remind you of my assessment of 3i's underperformance, which I set out in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","3i had spread its resources too thinly and created a very broad international platform, encompassing many different investment teams.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There was little central control, and results suffered from a high level of inconsistency.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The Private Equity portfolio was, in many cases, not managed as closely or as actively as they should have been and suffered from that material overinvestment in 2007 and 2008 at the very top of the cycle.",1095
18511,"2012m11","3i had lots of different controls and limits, but it had no annual vintage limit on its own balance sheet investments.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In other words, there was no cap on how much the investment teams could invest each year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have now put in place an annual vintage control policy.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It not only includes limits on the amount we invest from our balance sheet in a given year, but it also used in conjunction with our annual budgeting process.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we review it quarterly in the Executive Committee.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And as I said earlier, operating costs were far greater than the group's annual cash income that we generate from management fees and the portfolio itself.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The group did not appear to me to be operating as a normal commercial business and seemed to lack the very disciplines it routinely demanded of its investing companies.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So my priorities for this financial year are to restructure the business and bring a much greater degree of control and focus to our asset management activities.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I want us to work at the same levels of consistency and discipline as the best organizations in our sector.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have individuals and individual teams that do exactly that, but we don't do it consistently across the group.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The restructuring of the business is on track.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've already reduced headcount by over 100 people, and we're on track to meet our target reduction of 160 by the end of this financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we've closed 5 offices.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And with the sale of Birmingham that will complete in January, we will have met our target of 6 office closures.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We're also well on the way to achieving run rate operating cost savings of GBP 40 million by March next year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That's against our baseline annualized run rate operating cost of GBP 185 million at March this year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In June, we also announced 6 asset management improvement initiatives, which had been developed with our Private Equity teams during my 6 months as 3i CIO.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That program of initiatives has been substantially implemented and will have a significant positive impact on the performance of our portfolio over the coming years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You will recall that they involve changes to our investment review process and exit strategy and planning, as well as a review of our people strategy in terms of governance and resourcing.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The next slide illustrates one of these 6 initiatives, a subject I call, the dashboard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","When I joined 3i in October last year, I was concerned that the number of instances where the group only seemed to recognize serious performance issues in investee  companies very late in the day.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I was also surprised that the infrequent flow of realtime financial information on key portfolio of companies to the senior executives of the group.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Again, I felt the group fell some way short of best practice in the Private Equity sector, and that could only be partially explained by the size and breadth of the portfolio at 3i.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So using some of my prior experience, I instigated a project with the Private Equity team to bring our monitoring and performance tracking up to best in class.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We brought in Bain & Company, and together, we designed a dashboard for each of our material Private Equity investments.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The dashboard focused on strategic financial and operational KPIs, as well as presenting relevant commentary on the specific company and its performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It also gave an assessment of its cash flow and its debt position.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Each dashboard is now produced within 3 weeks of monthly management accounts and sent around in an email to the Investment Committee and the senior partners in our Private Equity business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There is then a review meeting where we look of the portfolio's performance once a month, and it's now very easy to use the KPI information to set the agenda for that meeting.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So that we focus on the companies with performance issues.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We then agree the actions to take and review the follow-up at the next meeting.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In my view, this initiative is transforming the effectiveness of 3i's monitoring and performance tracking.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So that we now have a system, which is timely and truly best in class.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It's been a busy and stretching 6 months for everyone at 3i.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It's been tough on those people who have been asked to leave, but it's also been very tough on those people, who have stayed.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And all of this has been happening against the backdrop of some very unhelpful macroeconomic conditions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I'm confident we will deliver both the restructuring I've been talking about, as well as the asset management initiatives that will lift our investment performance in due course.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So in my view, it's time for us to focus on the next part of our recovery plan, transition and delivery.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The transition and delivery will span financial years ending in March 2014 and March 2015.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we'll focus on aligning our operating costs to our income.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It will also include a hard look at our capital allocation and the growth in third-party fee income.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The aggressive restructuring steps we are taking this year and next are part of an overall plan to bring our operating costs below our cash income on an annual basis.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We are doing this at a time when our third party private fee -- Private Equity fee income is reducing, as the funds themselves run off.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But it's also a time when we are seeing opportunities for growth in third-party fee income from Debt Management and from Infrastructure.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our goal will be to have a healthy surplus each year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You will all be familiar with this slide, which I used in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It shows in concept where we are moving to as a result of our actions and our cost in our reduction in gross debt levels.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And it highlights the significant potential we have for increasing shareholder distributions, as well as reinvestment in our business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This sum up, we launched a review of compensation across the group.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Compensation is our largest cost at around 60% of total annual operating costs and was not part of the cost reduction program we announced in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Compensation will be a key tool in delivering our new strategic objectives.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we've got to be absolutely sure that there is a fair balance of returns between employees and shareholders.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've adopted some key principles as part of that review.",1095
18511,"2012m11","An equitable split of returns between employees and shareholders.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we acknowledge that due to performance issues, we haven't always have that balance over the last few years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We plan to align compensation with our strategic objectives and make sure these objectives have an important influence on variable compensation, in particular.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Merits will play a more prominent role in variable compensation decisions, which will have a much greater spread from top to bottom than they have had in the past at 3i.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we'll make sure there is a clear link between overall compensation and shareholder returns.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That will mean that a greater proportion of our senior staff compensation will be in deferred shares to increase alignment with shareholders and the concept of ownership across the key managers in the group.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We plan to involve shareholders in this group-wide review and use the meetings following these results to gain feedback on these key compensation principles.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Early next year, the board intends to enter a formal shareholder consultation period led by Jonathan Asquith, the Chairman of our Remuneration Committee, with a view to seeking any necessary approvals at next summer's AGM.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That way, these changes will be locked in for our next financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Turning to the subject of third-party fee income, I'd like to start with Infrastructure.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have a very strong capability in Infrastructure investing.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we see good opportunities to grow both assets under management and third-party fee income over the coming years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We believe there will be increasing opportunities for private investment in government-related assets, as government finances become even more challenged.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we expect to see opportunities to take over management contracts as some existing Infrastructure funds.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Turning to Debt Management.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The team have enjoyed a busy and successful start to this financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Not only as Jeremy Ghose's team acquired management contracts in Europe from Invesco and set up a U.",1095
18511,"2012m11","platform with Fraser Sullivan, but they've also successfully launched their first 3i CLO fund in the U.",1095
18511,"2012m11",", adding $450 million of funds under management.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Again, like with Infrastructure, we believe that Debt Management is capable of good growth in third-party fee income in AUM over the medium term.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Fraser Sullivan has an excellent reputation in the U.",1095
18511,"2012m11","debt markets, and they are well placed to take advantage of the confident market conditions in the U.",1095
18511,"2012m11","to grow their core CLO business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We should also be able to develop into adjacent debt markets.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There may also be further bolt-on acquisition opportunities in the U.",1095
18511,"2012m11",", opportunities to accelerate our development of third-party fee income and to grow the AUM further.",1095
18511,"2012m11","However, the debt market in Europe remains fairly muted.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We need to continue to manage our existing funds effectively, as well as focusing on those products and capabilities that will position us well as the European market dynamics change.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This could take a number of routes as the banks pull back.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In terms of Private Equity over the last 6 months, realization levels and investment activity have been low, not least because of the acquired M&A markets and the continuing tricky macro conditions across Europe.",1095
18511,"2012m11","However, we've made some good realizations in the first half, including Esmalglass in Spain, and we exited EUSA Pharma from our noncore Private Equity portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In today's world, investment is not just about buying a strong business and loading it up with leverage.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our investment thesis invariably involves a growth or turnaround transformation, which can involve significant operational change.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And this is the most challenging part of our investment plans.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Things rarely stay right on plan.",1095
18511,"2012m11","They almost always move off either up or down.",1095
18511,"2012m11","When they move the wrong way off plan, we have to move quickly to write the situation, and we now have a much better monitoring tool to do that.",1095
18511,"2012m11","OneMed and GEKA have moved off plan in recent times, and we now focus on returning both of these to a better trajectory.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But it swings in roundabouts, an action, for example, which is our biggest Private Equity investment, has moved ahead far more quickly than we anticipated.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And in these sorts of cases, we've got to remain vigilant to make sure our plan and our management are ambitious enough.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have a number of specific strategic priorities to keep us fully occupied over the next 18 months and you'll be able to judge our performance against these priorities.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In particular, you'll be able to observe an increased level of realization activity from our Private Equity portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In turn, that will lead to enhanced shareholder distributions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've already set in train, preparations, which will underpin this realization activity.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And as I said earlier, this is a journey covering 3 distinct phases, and it's important to me that we increase transparency so that you can track our progress.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So in addition to the specific targets that we set out in June, we will be providing more detail on our cash income and our run rate operating costs from March next year, as well as further disclosure on all realizations, including cash profit and cash-on-cash multiples for each realization.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You know the shape of 3i today, but this is how we expect to see the group evolve over the medium term.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Clearly, as I've said, we'll have an emphasis on growth in third-party funds and fee income in both Infrastructure and Debt Management.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Proprietary capital will continue to play a significant role in our Private Equity business, but we'll be deploying more of our shareholders' funds in our 2 less cyclical divisions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In time, we've got to change the way the market looks at 3i.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We sit somewhere between the large-scale asset managers in the U.",1095
18511,"2012m11",", such as Blackstone and KKR and the investment trust of H -- SVG and HgCapital.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As we complete our restructuring, our objective is that the market not only values our portfolio of investments, but also values the profits we generate, especially as fund managers across our 3 investment platforms.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I'd now like to pass to Julia, who will take you through our interim results.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Yes, and although you had quite a high proportion of forward earnings you were using, presumably quite a low proportion of the valuation based on those forward earnings? Yes, yes.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And often, the companies that are already on -- that are taking forecast earnings have often got the lower values.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And it's a continuation of that strategy, but not in all cases.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Well, I think, as Simon has just said, we are reasonably cautious about the European environment.",1095
18511,"2012m11","By using the forecast earnings, we're trying to anticipate some of that, but we're not taking any further forward in the end of September.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we will all have to see how the European environment develops over the turn of the calendar year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I think it's a metric that's sort of -- it's a bit meaningless, if you are a cash investor in the business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So I placed less emphasis on it than perhaps you do.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But we'll be more explicit about the way to judge us in May.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Any more questions? Okay.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Well, I'd like to wrap it up.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Thanks for your attendance and mingle at the end if you want to ask anything in private.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Actually, if you split our multiple movement, sort of our first quarter, second quarter, there was more of an uptick in the multiples in the second quarter.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So nothing consistent with the Q3 movement that market has honed in on.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But if you do look at the multiple movement for the 6 months as a whole, actually, markets have been pretty flat over that period of time.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We do spend quite less time trying to go through those comparative sets relating to the sets of geographies that we're in.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And I feel pretty comfortable it's pretty much in line.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And then on your question about provisions and  impairments, I think as we talked about in the past, our provision numbers should really be low because we make a provision when we actually have a fear that the investment may fail.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we will anticipate negative performance through the use of forecast earnings.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So I think it will be a bit premature to find some correlation now between that number and the dashboard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Having said that, I'm confident that the dashboard will absolutely help our ability to anticipate any issues in the portfolio that need to be dealt with.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And that we usually expect that to flow through the valuations in time.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Bruce Hamilton, Morgan Stanley.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Three sort of follow-up questions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Firstly, on the cost.",1095
18511,"2012m11","When you talk about comp, should we read that as a meaning there's a further reduction in cost, or is it really more sort of about alignment and sort of making sure the right people get paid? Secondly, on realizations.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I recognized, obviously, there are companies now that look like they're ready for sale next financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But I mean would you regard the 15% uplift you just enjoyed as being a sort of a good number for next year, or something that you would be pretty disappointed with, because you can sell assets but what's the price? And then finally, on the return on equity, obviously, your previous sort of targets of 15%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The cost reduction plan, the de-gear of the balance sheet obviously helped, but you're still clearly some way off making your cost of equity.",1095
18511,"2012m11","What do you think is a -- would be a plausible sort of ROE sort of run rate looking 2 years out, when you've got the business back to towards its sort of full run rate? But I guess, I suspect the market will continue, to the extent that they value price to book, they'll look at your return on equity versus your cost of equity.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So what do you mean on managed -- fully focus on that internally.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Did you think that -- I mean you recognized that it will be quite an important output in terms of way your valuations get to, or do you think that's the wrong metric? Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Just have a question to Adrian really.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But just referring to earnings.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Can you talk about the sort of change between March and June and in June and September? I think there's real potential for our country fund around Brazil.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've been approached by a number of LPs, who've made that inquiry of us.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have a well-regarded team in Brazil.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've made our first investment.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've got a number of other proposals in the pipeline that are being considered at the moment, and it is a much more resilient economy than we see in Europe at the moment across Continental Europe, in particular, with pretty strong government finances and a very developing consumer society within the country.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we're looking hard at that.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We don't anticipate anything developing of that type before the second half of next year, but it will be a serious consideration going into next year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Iain Scouller from Oriel securities.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I've got a couple.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Firstly, on multiples.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I think you saw GBP 4 million gain between March and September.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Can you just talk about what the movement was between June and September, because I think over that period the small-cap index of about 10%; mid cap was up about 7%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We don't seem to see much of an impact for multiples over that period, so maybe due to business mix or maybe you've taken a cautious approach? And then the second one is on the portfolio review that you've carried out, Simon.",1095
18511,"2012m11","What would you say are the key strengths and weaknesses of the portfolio and particularly, with regards to the industry mix and any other factors? Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The results we've reported this morning is solid evidence of the progress we're making in the strategic initiatives that Simon has just outlined.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we've achieved those results against the challenging economic environment in which we all continue to operate.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Fundamental, political, regulatory and financial questions remained unanswered in Europe and beyond.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Equity markets have been up and down during the 6 months.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But in the markets and the sectors where we've operated, they've ended up broadly flat.",1095
18511,"2012m11","M&A activity has been muted.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There have been some signs of improvement more recently, but it will take time for any improvement to have an impact on our activity levels.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And finally, as a sterling investor, currency markets have also proved challenging with weakness in the euro and the rupee being particularly relevant for us.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So against that backdrop, here are our key financials, starting with the returns on our income statement.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The performance for the 6 months reflects a period of considerable change and development in 3i, but we have a degree of stability, returning to the underlying portfolio of performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Gross portfolio return of GBP 180 million reflects good realizations in the noncore portfolio in first quarter, better earnings performance in a big part of the Private Equity portfolio compared to last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And that GBP 180 million is a marked improvement on the loss of GBP 329 million in the year, 31st of March.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Fees in the period reduced to GBP 36 million, and that reflects the end of the investment period for Eurofund V, our most European buyout bond, but we had another strong period of Debt Management.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Operating costs are GBP 105 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That GBP 105 million includes the effect of implementing the changes to the business, which we announced in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We estimated then that implementation cost will be about GBP 30 million, and we have provided for GBP 25 million in this period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have made tangible progress in the relatively short time since the changes were announced in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We are on track to achieve the run rate savings of GBP 40 million that Simon talked about by the end of this financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In a minute, I'll outline the composition of the resulting net portfolio return of GBP 109 million by individual business line.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The total return takes account of the effects of our balance sheet and was a small loss of GBP 5 million compared to a GBP 656 million loss at the 31st of March.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We accounted for the payment of the final dividend when it was paid in July.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And that dividend payment, together with the total return, is rise to an NAV of GBP 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","73 at the 30th of September.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So how has that NAV progressed during the period? 
Opening NAV of GBP 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","79 was reduced by 5p for the final dividend.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Implementation costs and the effects of the gross debt reduction gave rise to further reductions of 3p and 2p, respectively.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Noncash FX, pension and other items was 6p.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As a result, underlying business performance contributed a 10p improvement.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we closed an NAV of GBP 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Now I'd like to talk about that underlying business performance in some more detail.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Each of our Infrastructure, Debt Management and Private Equity businesses have contributed to the total net portfolio return of GBP 109 million as you can see here.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The sharp eyed amongst you will notice that the 3 business lines don't actually add up to the total.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The difference is our noncore portfolio, and it's not usually so material.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But in this period, the sale of EUSA Pharma, which is a former bench capital asset, generated cash proceeds of GBP 72 million, an uplift of GBP 42 million over the opening book value and a money multiple of 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That's an excellent result, but I don't expect it to be repeated by the noncore business, which now accounts for only 2% of the portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As you've seen from Simon's presentation, we've made good progress on implementing changes we announced in June to reduce the complexity of the group and cut our cost base.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Simon just said, we announced 160 people would be leaving the business by the end of this financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Headcount at the end of the period was down by 104, so we remain on track to meet our run rate target in reducing cost by GBP 40 million as we start the next financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And as you can expect to discuss for the next -- for this year to be about the same level as last year, so we're talking about GBP 180 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","All these figures are before adjusting for Debt Management acquisitions in the period, but those incremental costs are more than covered by the fees the new businesses will generate.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So taking each principal business line in turn.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our Infrastructure team manages GBP 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","6 billion of assets under management, 30% of that or GBP 471 million is on 3i's balance sheet, so the contribution that we get is generated by a blended capital returns and fees net of cost.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The business has had another solid period, supported by the robust performance of its European portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","However, this solid performance was offset by the performance of the Indian portfolio, where the political, currency and sector conditions are more challenging.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In group terms, this performance translates into an increase of GBP 6 million in the value of our 34% share of 3i Infrastructure plc, unrealized value decreases of GBP 8 million in the Indian portfolio and dividend income of GBP 9 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","During the period, the group sold its investments in Lakeside Network.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We had invested alongside 3i Infrastructure last year to facilitate the completion of the deal.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And by the way, that's a good example of the benefit our permanent capital brings.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So now we sold our position at a gain, GBP 1 million gain, over the opening portfolio value.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our Debt Management business is capital light, but it's an important fee generator for the group.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It has performed well again, with fees from the original European business remaining ahead of plan, and they are now being supplemented by fees from the funds that we acquired from Invesco in August.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have further increased assets under management by our strategic partnership with Fraser Sullivan, which you heard about from Simon.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The return impacts of this last transaction is actually minimal in this period because the deal was only signed on the 28th of September.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Private Equity remains the most important contributor to our performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Today, it accounts for 80% of our portfolio and 47% of total assets under management, and that's why progress we have made on the asset management's initiatives outlined by Simon, are so critical.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Before going through the detail of the related gross portfolio return, I'd like to comment briefly on other aspects of the business' performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Fees have stepped down in the first half.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Eurofund V's investment period ended in November 2011, just a year ago and fees in our paid on invested capital rather than committed capital.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The operating expenses is GBP 73 million, include GBP 22 million of the GBP 25 million implementation costs.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Investments of GBP 131 million is lower than last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It includes the completions of GEKA, the final reinvestments in Eurofund V and Blue Interactive, the first investment made by our Brazil team.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The M&A market has been quiet through most of the period, and we have stayed cautious about new investment in Europe.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We generated realization proceeds of GBP 165 million at the, at an uplift over opening value of 15.",1095
18511,"2012m11","4%, and that represents an aggregate money multiple of 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","9x, generating realized profits of GBP 22 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've given much more detail about realizations during the period in our announcement today, and in the appendix to the slides.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In Private Equity, it is worth noting the disposal of Esmalglass, the Spanish investment was sold at a small uplift over the March value and at a money multiple of 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The Spanish portfolio now accounts for just 5% of the group's total.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The next slide gives you a picture of the diversity of the Private Equity portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","From a geographic perspective, our strongest performers continue to be in Northern Europe and the Americas.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Those regions make up 58% of the portfolio and have generated GBP 52 million of value growth in the period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There are small number of assets in Europe, which are more challenging, and we're cautious about the outlook for the French portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The French portfolio is now valued at GBP 216 million or 7% of the total.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The more recent vintages now account for 30% of the total portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Performance is not uniformly positive, but it's in those vintages from 2010 onwards that we've seen some very positive earnings growth with corresponding uplifts in value in the period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The 2007 to 2009 vintages were more stable in this period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","They're accounting for 66% of the portfolio and generating a value increase of GBP 53 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Now in the past, we've provided additional disclosure to give you a view on the trajectory of portfolio performance, taking accounts of commercial considerations and confidentiality obligations, and it's fair to say, with varying degrees of success.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This slide gives an indicator performance on an aggregate basis by comparing earnings performance versus the prior year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Blue line shows you the percentage by number of companies.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You have better earnings performance than last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So for the portfolio at 30th of September, just over 55% of companies are better, and they account for 70% of the value, and that's a steady performance since March.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Breaking this picture down to a company level, this slide gives an indication of the performance of our largest assets.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This is a positive picture, with a significant majority performance ahead of last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And you'll see from the additional information in the announcement, 35% of companies had growth of more than 10%; 24% of companies generated growth of more than 20%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So overall, the performance of the portfolio is better than it has been in our most recent periods.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And that improved portfolio performance is reflected in the valuations in the first half.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As I mentioned earlier, even though equity markets have been volatile, they actually finished broadly flat in the period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And the multiples used to value the portfolio were also similarly flat, increasing by only 1%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","For this reporting period, we typically use the last 12 months accounts to June as a basis of valuation, but we use forecast earnings if they're lower than the last 12 months to June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And 16 companies, 27%, were valued using current year forecast earnings.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Aggregate earnings used to value the portfolio, including those on forecast, grew by 1%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But on a valuated basis, earnings used to value the portfolio, grew by 9%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And as you might expect, the leverage in the portfolio valid using earnings fell to 3.",1095
18511,"2012m11","3x net debt to EBITDA multiple.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That was thanks to this better performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So bringing these data points together into the makeup of the unrealized value movement to GBP 66 million, you can see that the most material component relates to performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The positive, but small movements of GBP 4 million in provisions is the net effect of 3 companies, each movements being less than GBP 10 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And so that's not indicative of the wider trend.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Finally, the industry metric category includes ACR, our Asian reinsurance business, which continues to be impacted by the effects of the Thai floods at the end of 2011.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Turning then to the balance sheet, and in particular, to the gross debt reduction and the capital allocation model that Simon talked about earlier.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Key part of the strategic review we've just completed was to reduce the gross debt by using our cash resources.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have been reducing gross  debt since its peak of GBP 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","7 billion in March 2009, but it's the simplification of the business model and more direct central control that mean we can take the next significant steps.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We started the year with GBP 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","6 billion of gross debt and sets target to reduce its GBP 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","3 billion by the 30th of September and then reduce it further to GBP 1 billion by June 2013.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Gross debt at the end of the period was GBP 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","2 billion, so we are ahead of our intermediate target.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've done that through a combination of scheduled maturities, but also by being opportunistic in making some early repayments.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Gross interest for the period of GBP 60 million includes GBP 20 million of accelerated interest costs.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I expect that the full year charge will be marginally less than last financial year, and importantly, that the run rate of net interest payable at the start of next year will be nearer to GBP 60 million for the full year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we are ahead of our original plan.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And I am confident that we're on track to meet the GBP 1 billion target by June 2013.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This is particularly important.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It's not only important because of the impact on the run rate of interest, but also because of its link to our capital allocation and distribution policy.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The target capital allocation framework that we set out in June, which Simon has just restated, means we will deploy more of our capital to shareholder distribution and to investment in our core businesses over time.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The quality of realizations in the period has been good, but as we had expected, lower in absolute terms than in prior years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That reduction and realizations, together with a significant progress we're making to reduce gross debt, means there was a net cash outflow of GBP 390 million in the period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Of course, repayments of gross debt has no impact on net debt or gearing.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Net debt increased only marginally from GBP 464 million to GBP 493 million and gearing went from 18% to 19%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That's another important factor in our capital distribution policy.",1095
18511,"2012m11","To remind you what we set out in May.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We rebased our dividend to 8.",1095
18511,"2012m11","1p per share this time last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we defined the basis of aggregate shareholders distributions as 15% to 20% of gross cash proceeds from realizations, provided that gearing is less than 20%, and that we're on  target to have gross debt less than GBP 1 billion by June 2013.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We also indicated that realizations were likely to be lower in this financial year, and the first half performance is consistent with that lower forecast.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Therefore, it's still the case, but it will be next financial year before you should expect any meaningful increase in shareholder distribution.",1095
18511,"2012m11","1p levels set last year should be seen as a base for the dividend.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we announced today, an interim dividend of 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","7p per share, with an intention to pay 8.",1095
18511,"2012m11","1p per share as the total dividend for the year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So before I hand back to Simon to wrap up, I'll just quickly summarize the results for the 6 months of 30th of September, 2012.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This has been a period of very considerable change.",1095
18511,"2012m11","A lot of which is reflected in the numbers, and some of which will take longer to prove its potential.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've made good progress in restructuring the business, and we've seen a degree of stability in the underlying performance of the portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The total return loss of GBP 5 million reflects its better performance from our Private Equity portfolio and steady contributions from Infrastructure and Debt Management, as well as the cost of restructuring.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The balance sheet remains strong, and the progress that we've made in reducing gross debt will improve returns and cash flow from next year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","All of this has created a leaner business and prepares us for increased shareholder distributions as the level of our realizations improved.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I'll now hand back to Simon.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Let me take the first, and Julia can take the second.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I think on realizations, we have a number of initiatives in train where it takes about 6 to 9 months to sell a company from agreeing with management to plan for the exit, appointing advisers and putting together the process that leads to a successful sale.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we've started that in a number of cases, and we started that with companies that, we then, for varying degrees of time, but are all at a point where they can be sold effectively in markets that don't have to be even as robust as they are now and give the buyer a further traction to hold those investments going forward, so another leg to the story.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we've identified those businesses.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You've read about some of them in the press.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We haven't confirmed any of them yet, but those processes are kicking off, and we would expect to see the results of them in calendar 2013.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Henry over here.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Daniel Garrod, Barclays.",1095
18511,"2012m11","A couple of questions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","First, you mentioned about sort of action that you were taking on the realization side to ensure that next year, there is a step-up in realizations.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I I'm wondered if you could provide any color on that to what degree it is relying on sort of primary markets improving, so obviously in this sort of period, relatively low level of realized profits and realizations overall.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Is it just down to sort of vintage of the portfolio that it's that much more optimal to divest next year? Second question, minimal sort of provisions and impairment go through the unrealized movement this period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","How sort of sustainable do you feel that is? Has -- you touched on this implementation of the dashboard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Has that helped in any way achieve that, or is it coincidence -- have you achieved that? You've actually -- productive how the portfolio's been performing, you had minimal provisions and impairments, do you see it contributing to lower provision impairments going forward or is just the dashboard that will contribute to earlier recognition? It's Henry Freeman from Investec Securities.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We read in the press of the weekend about a potential raise in for Private Equity in Brazil.",1095
18511,"2012m11","What is the potential -- obviously, you focused, specifically, on management businesses in Infrastructure and Debt Management.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But what is the potential for a South American raise? Okay, let me try and tackle those.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In terms of comp, it -- we're taking out a trunk of comp through the restructuring, so we're losing 1/3 of our staff, so that is really taking down that number.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In terms of the balance, it's going to be very aligned to the returns of the group is making itself, so that will determine the size of the overall compensation pool, and then the division of that pool will be much darker between the strong performers and the weaker performers.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So I would anticipate some people earning more than they earn at the moment, and some people earning considerably less.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And the variable pay will be used in that regard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And when we use shares as deferred compensation to -- I'm sure people build up a stake in the business, we'll make sure that, that's non-dilutive.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So any shares that are issued as part of that will be brought back in, in the market.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I think in terms of realizations, given the state of the world, I don't want to be led in anything in that regard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But all the mix of companies that are being put up for sale, some of them are in response to a purchase to us, and it's harder to make a judgment about those sorts of prices.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But the ones that we are managing and our promoting ourselves, we feel very confident about the saleability.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And the last one, ROE.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That was a target from another management team.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I'm still trying to work out the best way to be judged in this business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I have much greater focus on cash and on cash-on-cash returns, and I would expect us to talk in detail in May about how we'll be presenting the group going forward once we've completed the restructuring.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So those sorts of returns and measures will be a critical part of that.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Yes, I think we saw a similar profile with slightly better performance in the -- our second quarter of the first half.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But clearly, the number of forecast earnings we have did also go up in that period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There's a timing issue with that, as companies come closer to that calendar year end.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So yes, it's consistent with the overall shape of the half.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And I mean, just bearing in mind, Simon,  sort of cautious comments on Europe.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Can you give any flavor for how you might expect earnings to develop? Thanks, Julia.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to conclude the presentation with a few key messages.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As I said earlier, we've had a busy period over the last 6 months, and I think we've made great progress on the restructuring in the business against a very difficult macro conditions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We're on track to meet the cost and the debt reduction targets that we set out in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our overall financial performance has been stable, with a better performance from Private Equity and steady contributions from Infrastructure and our Debt Management business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We're focusing on the next stage of our strategic plan: transition and delivery, which covers financial years 2014 and 2015.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Transition and delivery will be about aligning our cost to our income, shifting our capital allocation and growing third-party fee income.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As part of that, I expect our pipeline of realizations in Private Equity to come through over the next 2 years and to support enhanced shareholder distributions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So those are our key messages, and they identify our priorities and how we would like to be measured over the next few years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","With that in mind, we'd now be delighted to take some Q&A.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We got some mics, so.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I think on the portfolio review, I'm comfortable with where the thing is valued.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You've seen from the realization total in the release today that we've effectively made realizations of -- ahead of the marks we had in our book.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There are a good spread of companies.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I guess the concerning thing is that the overwhelming majority of the investment is in Europe.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We see 2013 being pretty tricky in Europe for all sorts of reasons, and that would affect some of the Northern European countries, and the country we are worried about is France.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we will see some headwinds in that regard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But in general, we're very comfortable with the general state of the portfolio, but of the well-known problem that you all know about -- but apart from that, the bulk of the value is really in some pretty good companies.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Just have a question to Adrian, really.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But just referring to earnings.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Can you talk about the sort of change between March and June and in June and September? Julia, why don't you do with the multiples question, first.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And I mean, just bearing in mind, Simon, sort of cautious comments on Europe.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Can you give any flavor for how you might expect earnings to develop? Thanks, Julia.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Before we move on to Q&A, I'd like to conclude the presentation with a few key messages.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As I said earlier, we've had a busy period over the last 6 months, and I think we've made great progress on the restructuring in the business against the very difficult macro conditions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We're on track to meet the cost and the debt reduction targets that we set out in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our overall financial performance has been stable, with a better performance from Private Equity and steady contributions from Infrastructure and our Debt Management business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We're focusing on the next stage of our strategic plan: transition and delivery, which covers financial years 2014 and 2015.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Transition and delivery will be about aligning our cost to our income, shifting our capital allocation and growing third-party fee income.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As part of that, I expect our pipeline of realizations in Private Equity to come through over the next 2 years and to support enhanced shareholder distributions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So those are our key messages, and they identify our priorities and how we would like to be measured over the next few years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","With that in mind, we'd now be delighted to take some Q&A.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We got some mics, so.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Okay, let me try and tackle those.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In terms of comp, it -- we're taking out a trunk of comp through the restructuring, so we're losing 1/3 of our staff, so that is really taking down that number.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In terms of the balance, it's going to be very aligned to the returns of the group is making itself, so that will determine the size of the overall compensation pool, and then the division of that pool will be much darker between the strong performers and the weaker performers.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So I would anticipate some people earning more than they earn at the moment, and some people earning considerably less.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And the variable pay will be used in that regard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And when we use shares as deferred compensation to -- I'm sure people build up a stake in the business, we'll make sure that, that's non-dilutive.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So any shares that are issued as part of that will be brought back in, in the market.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I think in terms of realizations, given the state of the world, I don't want to be led in anything in that regard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But all the mix of companies that are being put up for sale, some of them are in response to a purchase to us, and it's harder to make a judgment about those sorts of prices.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But the ones that we are managing and our promoting ourselves, we feel very confident about the saleability.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And the last one, ROE.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That was a target from another management team.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I'm still trying to work out the best way to be judged in this business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I have much greater focus on cash and on cash-on-cash returns, and I would expect us to talk in detail in May about how we'll be presenting the group going forward once we've completed the restructuring.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So those sorts of returns and measures will be a critical part of that.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Let me take the first, and Julia can take the second.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I think on realizations, we have a number of initiatives in train where it takes about 6 to 9 months to sell a company from agreeing with management to plan for the exit, appointing advisers and putting together the process that leads to a successful sale.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we've started that in a number of cases, and we started that with companies that we’ve owned for varying degrees of time, but are all at the point where they can be sold effectively in markets that don't have to be even as robust as they are now and give the buyer a further traction to hold those investments going forward, so another leg to the story.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we've identified those businesses.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You've read about some of them in the press.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We haven't confirmed any of them yet, but those processes are kicking off, and we would expect to see the results of them in calendar 2013.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Iain Scouller from Oriel securities.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I've got a couple.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Firstly, on multiples.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I think you saw GBP 4 million gain between March and September.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Can you just talk about what the movement was between June and September, because I think over that period the small-cap index of about 10%; mid cap was up about 7%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We don't seem to see much of an impact for multiples over that period, so maybe due to business mix or maybe you've taken a cautious approach? And then the second one is on the portfolio review that you've carried out, Simon.",1095
18511,"2012m11","What would you say are the key strengths and weaknesses of the portfolio and particularly with regards to the industry mix and any other factors? Yes, I think we saw a similar profile with slightly better performance in the -- our second quarter of the first half.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But clearly, the number of forecast earnings we have did also go up in that period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There's a timing issue with that, as companies come closer to that calendar year end.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So yes, it's consistent with the overall shape of the half.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And often, the companies that are already on -- that are taking forecast earnings have often got the lower values.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And it's a continuation of that strategy, but not in all cases.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Daniel Garrod, Barclays.",1095
18511,"2012m11","A couple of questions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","First, you mentioned about sort of action that you were taking on the realization side to ensure that next year there is a step-up in realizations.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I'm wondering if you could provide any color on that to what degree it is relying on sort of primary markets improving, so obviously in this sort of period, relatively low level of realized profits and realizations overall.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Is it just down to sort of vintage of the portfolio that it's that much more optimal to divest next year? Second question, minimal sort of provisions and impairment go through the unrealized movement this period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","How sort of sustainable do you feel that is? Has -- you touched on this implementation of the dashboard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Has that helped in any way achieve that, or is it coincidence -- have you achieved that? You've actually -- productive how the portfolio's been performing, you had minimal provisions and impairments, do you see it contributing to lower provision impairments going forward, or is just the dashboard that will contribute to earlier recognition? I think it's a metric that's sort of -- it's a bit meaningless, if you are a cash investor in the business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So I place less emphasis on it than perhaps you do.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But we'll be more explicit about the way to judge us in May.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Any more questions? Okay.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Well, I'd like to wrap it up.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Thanks for your attendance and mingle at the end if you want to ask anything in private.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But I guess, I suspect the market will continue to the extent that they value price to book, they'll look at your return on equity versus your cost of equity.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So what do you mean on managed -- fully focus on that internally.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Did you think that -- I mean you recognized that it will be quite an important output in terms of way your valuations get to, or do you think that's the wrong metric? Actually, if you split our multiple movement, sort of our first quarter, second quarter, there was more of an uptick in the multiples in the second quarter.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So nothing consistent with the Q3 movement that market has honed in on.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But if you do look at the multiple movement for the 6 months as a whole, actually markets have been pretty flat over that period of time.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We do spend quite less time trying to go through those comparative sets relating to the sets of geographies that we're in.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And I feel pretty comfortable it's pretty much in line.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Okay, I think everyone's through.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to 3i's results presentation.",1095
18511,"2012m11","For most of the last 10 years, 3i had relied on using part of the firm's capital gains from investment sales to pay for a significant part of the group's annual running costs.",1095
18511,"2012m11","While that was workable in the buoyant years of the Mid-Northeast, that approach never made any real financial sense.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And in recent years, using capital gains to fund our operating costs has led to a hollowing out of the firm's capital, because high operating costs and interest costs have made a very poor capital returns performance even worse at the bottom line.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've had a busy 6 months restructuring the group and reversing this approach, as well as introducing a number of new asset management initiatives across our Private Equity business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The journey has just begun, but we've made a strong start in some tough macroeconomic conditions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And today, I'd like to give you an update on our progress on that redirected journey.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I'd also like to reinforce my confidence in the next steps we're taking on the road to recovery.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our strategic goal hasn't changed.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We remain focused on managing third party and proprietary capital across our 3 investment platforms.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our target is to deliver top quartile returns.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And while each business is at a different point in its development and faces different specific challenges, our vision and our strategy are clear.",1095
18511,"2012m11","3i had stumbled badly over the past few years, and there was a fair degree of confusion and doubt in the organization when I arrived late last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Not only was there an incoherence between what the group was trying to do and what it could afford to do, but the investment record in Private Equity was suffering badly from a very mixed portfolio of investments made at the top of the cycling calendar, years 2007 and 2008.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The group was also struggling with the challenge of managing a decentralized organization, that had investment teams spread across a lot of different geographies and the lack of control and consistency which that produced.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Putting this right is no quick fix and delivering our strategic goal will take some time.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But putting our house in order, realizing our existing portfolio of Private Equity investments and recovering our reputation in investment and asset management should deliver significant rewards for shareholders in the coming years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Before I take you through our actions over the last few months, I'd like to remind you of my assessment of 3i's underperformance, which I set out in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","3i had spread its resources too thinly and created a very broad international platform, encompassing many different investment teams.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There was little central control, and results suffered from a high level of inconsistency.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The Private Equity portfolio was, in many cases, not managed as closely or as actively as they should have been and suffered from that material overinvestment in 2007 and 2008 at the very top of the cycle.",1095
18511,"2012m11","3i had lots of different controls and limits, but it had no annual vintage limit on its own balance sheet investments.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In other words, there was no cap on how much the investment teams could invest each year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have now put in place an annual vintage control policy.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It not only includes limits on the amount we invest from our balance sheet in a given year, but it’s also used in conjunction with our annual budgeting process.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we review it quarterly in the Executive Committee.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And as I said earlier, operating costs were far greater than the group's annual cash income that we generate from management fees and the portfolio itself.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The group did not appear to me to be operating as a normal commercial business and seemed to lack the very disciplines it routinely demanded of its investing companies.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So my priorities for this financial year are to restructure the business and bring a much greater degree of control and focus to our asset management activities.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I want us to work at the same levels of consistency and discipline as the best organizations in our sector.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have individuals and individual teams that do exactly that, but we don't do it consistently across the group.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The restructuring of the business is on track.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've already reduced headcount by over 100 people, and we're on track to meet our target reduction of 160 by the end of this financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we've closed 5 offices.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And with the sale of Birmingham that will complete in January, we will have met our target of 6 office closures.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We're also well on the way to achieving run rate operating cost savings of GBP 40 million by March next year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That's against our baseline annualized run rate operating cost of GBP 185 million at March this year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In June, we also announced 6 asset management improvement initiatives which had been developed with our Private Equity teams during my 6 months as 3i CIO.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That program of initiatives has been substantially implemented and will have a significant positive impact on the performance of our portfolio over the coming years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You will recall that they involve changes to our investment review process and exit strategy and planning, as well as a review of our people strategy in terms of governance and resourcing.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The next slide illustrates one of these 6 initiatives, a subject I call the dashboard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","When I joined 3i in October last year, I was concerned that the number of instances where the group only seemed to recognize serious performance issues in investee companies very late in the day.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I was also surprised that the infrequent flow of realtime financial information on key portfolio of companies to the senior executives of the group.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Again, I felt the group fell somewhere short of best practice in the Private Equity sector, and that could only be partially explained by the size and breadth of the portfolio at 3i.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So using some of my prior experience, I instigated a project with the Private Equity team to bring our monitoring and performance tracking up to best in class.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We brought in Bain & Company and together, we designed a dashboard for each of our material Private Equity investments.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The dashboard focused on strategic financial and operational KPIs, as well as presenting relevant commentary on the specific company and its performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It also gave an assessment of its cash flow and its debt position.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Each dashboard is now produced within 3 weeks of monthly management accounts and sent around in an email to the Investment Committee and the senior partners in our Private Equity business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There is then a review meeting where we look of the portfolio's performance once a month, and it's now very easy to use the KPI information to set the agenda for that meeting so that we focus on the companies with performance issues.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We then agree the actions to take and review the follow-up at the next meeting.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In my view, this initiative is transforming the effectiveness of 3i's monitoring and performance tracking so that we now have a system which is timely and truly best in class.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It's been a busy and stretching 6 months for everyone at 3i.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It's been tough on those people who have been asked to leave, but it's also been very tough on those people who have stayed.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And all of this has been happening against the backdrop of some very unhelpful macroeconomic conditions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I'm confident we will deliver both the restructuring I've been talking about, as well as the asset management initiatives that will lift our investment performance in due course.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So in my view, it's time for us to focus on the next part of our recovery plan, transition and delivery.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The transition and delivery will span financial years ending in March 2014 and March 2015.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we'll focus on aligning our operating costs to our income.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It will also include a hard look at our capital allocation and the growth in third-party fee income.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The aggressive restructuring steps we are taking this year and next are part of an overall plan to bring our operating costs below our cash income on an annual basis.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We are doing this at a time when our third party private fee -- Private Equity fee income is reducing, as the funds themselves run off.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But it's also a time when we are seeing opportunities for growth in third-party fee income from Debt Management and from Infrastructure.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our goal will be to have a healthy surplus each year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You will all be familiar with this slide, which I used in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It shows in concept where we are moving to as a result of our actions and our cost in our reduction in gross debt levels.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And it highlights the significant potential we have for increasing shareholder distributions, as well as reinvestment in our business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This summer, we launched a review of compensation across the group.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Compensation is our largest cost at around 60% of total annual operating costs and was not part of the cost reduction program we announced in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Compensation will be a key tool in delivering our new strategic objectives.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we've got to be absolutely sure that there is a fair balance of returns between employees and shareholders.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've adopted some key principles as part of that review.",1095
18511,"2012m11","An equitable split of returns between employees and shareholders.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we acknowledge that due to performance issues, we haven't always have that balance over the last few years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We plan to align compensation with our strategic objectives and make sure these objectives have an important influence on variable compensation, in particular.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Merits will play a more prominent role in variable compensation decisions, which will have a much greater spread from top to bottom than they have had in the past at 3i.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we'll make sure there is a clear link between overall compensation and shareholder returns.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That will mean that a greater proportion of our senior staff compensation will be in deferred shares to increase alignment with shareholders and the concept of ownership across the key managers in the group.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We plan to involve shareholders in this group-wide review and use the meetings following these results to gain feedback on these key compensation principles.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Early next year, the board intends to enter a formal shareholder consultation period led by Jonathan Asquith, the Chairman of our Remuneration Committee, with a view to seeking any necessary approvals at next summer's AGM.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That way, these changes will be locked in for our next financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Turning to the subject of third-party fee income, I'd like to start with Infrastructure.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have a very strong capability in Infrastructure investing, and we see good opportunities to grow both assets under management and third-party fee income over the coming years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We believe there will be increasing opportunities for private investment in government-related assets, as government finances become even more challenged.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we expect to see opportunities to take over management contracts of some existing Infrastructure funds.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Turning to Debt Management.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The team have enjoyed a busy and successful start to this financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Not only has Jeremy Ghose's team acquired management contracts in Europe from Invesco and set up a U.",1095
18511,"2012m11","platform with Fraser Sullivan, but they've also successfully launched their first 3i CLO fund in the U.",1095
18511,"2012m11",", adding $450 million of funds under management.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Again, like with Infrastructure, we believe that Debt Management is capable of good growth in third-party fee income in AUM over the medium term.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Fraser Sullivan has an excellent reputation in the U.",1095
18511,"2012m11","debt markets, and they are well placed to take advantage of the confident market conditions in the U.",1095
18511,"2012m11","to grow their core CLO business.",1095
18511,"2012m11","They should also be able to develop into adjacent debt markets.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There may also be further bolt-on acquisition opportunities in the U.",1095
18511,"2012m11",", opportunities to accelerate our development of third-party fee income and to grow the AUM further.",1095
18511,"2012m11","However, the debt market in Europe remains fairly muted.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We need to continue to manage our existing funds effectively, as well as focusing on those products and capabilities that will position us well as the European market dynamics change.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This could take a number of routes as the banks pull back.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In terms of Private Equity over the last 6 months, realization levels and investment activity have been low, not least because of the acquired M&A markets and the continuing tricky macro conditions across Europe.",1095
18511,"2012m11","However, we've made some good realizations in the first half, including Esmalglass in Spain, and we exited EUSA Pharma from our noncore Private Equity portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In today's world, investment is not just about buying a strong business and loading it up with leverage.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our investment thesis invariably involves a growth or turnaround transformation, which can involve significant operational change.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And this is the most challenging part of our investment plans.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Things rarely stay right on plan.",1095
18511,"2012m11","They almost always move off either up or down.",1095
18511,"2012m11","When they move the wrong way off plan, we have to move quickly to right the situation, and we now have a much better monitoring tool to do that.",1095
18511,"2012m11","OneMed and GEKA have moved off plan in recent times, and we now focus on returning both of these to a better trajectory.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But it swings in roundabouts, an action, for example, which is our biggest Private Equity investment, has moved ahead far more quickly than we anticipated.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And in these sorts of cases, we've got to remain vigilant to make sure our plan and our management are ambitious enough.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have a number of specific strategic priorities to keep us fully occupied over the next 18 months and you'll be able to judge our performance against these priorities.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In particular, you'll be able to observe an increased level of realization activity from our Private Equity portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In turn, that will lead to enhanced shareholder distributions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've already set in train preparations which will underpin this realization activity.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And as I said earlier, this is a journey covering 3 distinct phases, and it's important to me that we increase transparency so that you can track our progress.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So in addition to the specific targets that we set out in June, we will be providing more detail on our cash income and our run rate operating costs from March next year, as well as further disclosure on all realizations, including cash profit and cash-on-cash multiples for each realization.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You know the shape of 3i today, but this is how we expect to see the group evolve over the medium term.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Clearly, as I've said, we'll have an emphasis on growth in third-party funds and fee income in both Infrastructure and Debt Management.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Proprietary capital will continue to play a significant role in our Private Equity business, but we'll be deploying more of our shareholders' funds in our 2 less cyclical divisions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In time, we've got to change the way the market looks at 3i.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We sit somewhere between the large-scale asset managers in the U.",1095
18511,"2012m11",", such as Blackstone and KKR and the investment trust of H -- SVG and HgCapital.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As we complete our restructuring, our objective is that the market not only values our portfolio of investments, but also values the profits we generate, especially as fund managers across our 3 investment platforms.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I'd now like to pass to Julia, who will take you through our interim results.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And then on your question about provisions and  impairments, I think as we talked about in the past, our provision numbers should really be low because we make a provision when we actually have a fear that the investment may fail.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we will anticipate negative performance through the use of forecast earnings.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So I think it will be a bit premature to find some correlation now between that number and the dashboard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Having said that, I'm confident that the dashboard will absolutely help our ability to anticipate any issues in the portfolio that need to be dealt with.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And that we usually expect that to flow through the valuations in time.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It's Henry Freeman from Investec Securities.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We read in the press of the weekend about a potential raise in for Private Equity in Brazil.",1095
18511,"2012m11","What is the potential -- obviously, you focused specifically on management businesses in Infrastructure and Debt Management.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But what is the potential for a South American raise? I think there's real potential for our country fund around Brazil.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've been approached by a number of LPs who've made that inquiry of us.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have a well-regarded team in Brazil.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've made our first investment.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've got a number of other proposals in the pipeline that are being considered at the moment, and it is a much more resilient economy than we see in Europe at the moment across Continental Europe, in particular with pretty strong government finances and a very developing consumer society within the country.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we're looking hard at that.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We don't anticipate anything developing of that type before the second half of next year, but it will be a serious consideration going into next year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Henry over here.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Bruce Hamilton, Morgan Stanley.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Three sort of follow-up questions.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Firstly, on the cost.",1095
18511,"2012m11","When you talk about comp, should we read that as a meaning there's a further reduction in cost, or is it really more sort of about alignment and sort of making sure the right people get paid? Secondly, on realizations.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I recognize obviously there are companies now that look like they're ready for sale next financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But I mean would you regard the 15% uplift you just enjoyed as being a sort of a good number for next year, or something that you would be pretty disappointed with, because you can sell assets but what's the price? And then finally, on the return on equity, obviously your previous sort of targets of 15%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The cost reduction plan, the de-gear of the balance sheet obviously helped, but you're still clearly some way off making your cost of equity.",1095
18511,"2012m11","What do you think is a -- would be a plausible sort of ROE sort of run rate looking 2 years out, when you've got the business back to towards its sort of full run rate? Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The results we've reported this morning is solid evidence of the progress we're making in the strategic initiatives that Simon has just outlined.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we've achieved those results against the challenging economic environment in which we all continue to operate.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Fundamental, political, regulatory and financial questions remained unanswered in Europe and beyond.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Equity markets have been up and down during the 6 months.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But in the markets and the sectors where we've operated, they've ended up broadly flat.",1095
18511,"2012m11","M&A activity has been muted.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There have been some signs of improvement more recently, but it will take time for any improvement to have an impact on our activity levels.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And finally, as a sterling investor, currency markets have also proved challenging with weakness in the euro and the rupee being particularly relevant for us.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So against that backdrop, here are our key financials, starting with the returns on our income statement.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The performance for the 6 months reflects a period of considerable change and development in 3i, but we have a degree of stability, returning to the underlying portfolio of performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Gross portfolio return of GBP 180 million reflects good realizations in the noncore portfolio in first quarter, better earnings performance in a big part of the Private Equity portfolio compared to last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And that GBP 180 million is a marked improvement on the loss of GBP 329 million in the year, 31st of March.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Fees in the period reduced to GBP 36 million, and that reflects the end of the investment period for Eurofund V, our most European buyout bond, but we had another strong period of Debt Management.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Operating costs are GBP 105 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That GBP 105 million includes the effect of implementing the changes to the business, which we announced in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We estimated then that implementation cost will be about GBP 30 million, and we have provided for GBP 25 million in this period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have made tangible progress in the relatively short time since the changes were announced in June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We are on track to achieve the run rate savings of GBP 40 million that Simon talked about by the end of this financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In a minute, I'll outline the composition of the resulting net portfolio return of GBP 109 million by individual business line.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The total return takes account of the effects of our balance sheet and was a small loss of GBP 5 million compared to a GBP 656 million loss at the 31st of March.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We accounted for the payment of the final dividend when it was paid in July.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And that dividend payment, together with the total return, is rise to an NAV of GBP 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","73 at the 30th of September.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So how has that NAV progressed during the period? 
Opening NAV of GBP 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","79 was reduced by 5p for the final dividend.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Implementation costs and the effects of the gross debt reduction gave rise to further reductions of 3p and 2p, respectively.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Noncash FX, pension and other items was 6p.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As a result, underlying business performance contributed a 10p improvement.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we closed an NAV of GBP 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Now I'd like to talk about that underlying business performance in some more detail.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Each of our Infrastructure, Debt Management and Private Equity businesses have contributed to the total net portfolio return of GBP 109 million as you can see here.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The sharp eyed amongst you will notice that the 3 business lines don't actually add up to the total.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The difference is our noncore portfolio, and it's not usually so material.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But in this period, the sale of EUSA Pharma, which is a former bench capital asset, generated cash proceeds of GBP 72 million, an uplift of GBP 42 million over the opening book value and a money multiple of 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That's an excellent result, but I don't expect it to be repeated by the noncore business, which now accounts for only 2% of the portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As you've seen from Simon's presentation, we've made good progress on implementing changes we announced in June to reduce the complexity of the group and cut our cost base.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Simon just said we announced 160 people would be leaving the business by the end of this financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Headcount at the end of the period was down by 104, so we remain on track to meet our run rate target in reducing cost by GBP 40 million as we start the next financial year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And as you can expect to discuss for the next -- for this year to be about the same level as last year, so we're talking about GBP 180 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","All these figures are before adjusting for Debt Management acquisitions in the period, but those incremental costs are more than covered by the fees the new businesses will generate.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So taking each principal business line in turn.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our Infrastructure team manages GBP 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","6 billion of assets under management, 30% of that or GBP 471 million is on 3i's balance sheet, so the contribution that we get is generated by a blend of capital returns and fees net of cost.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The business has had another solid period, supported by the robust performance of its European portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","However, this solid performance was offset by the performance of the Indian portfolio, where the political, currency and sector conditions are more challenging.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In group terms, this performance translates into an increase of GBP 6 million in the value of our 34% share of 3i Infrastructure plc, unrealized value decreases of GBP 8 million in the Indian portfolio and dividend income of GBP 9 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","During the period, the group sold its investments in Lakeside Network.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We had invested alongside 3i Infrastructure last year to facilitate the completion of the deal.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And by the way, that's a good example of the benefit our permanent capital brings.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So now we sold our position at a gain, GBP 1 million gain, over the opening portfolio value.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Our Debt Management business is capital light, but it's an important fee generator for the group.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It has performed well again, with fees from the original European business remaining ahead of plan, and they are now being supplemented by fees from the funds that we acquired from Invesco in August.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have further increased assets under management by our strategic partnership with Fraser Sullivan, which you heard about from Simon.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The return impacts of this last transaction is actually minimal in this period because the deal was only signed on the 28th of September.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Private Equity remains the most important contributor to our performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Today, it accounts for 80% of our portfolio and 47% of total assets under management, and that's why progress we have made on the asset management's initiatives outlined by Simon, are so critical.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Before going through the detail of the related gross portfolio return, I'd like to comment briefly on other aspects of the business' performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Fees have stepped down in the first half.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Eurofund V's investment period ended in November 2011, just a year ago, and fees in our paid on invested capital rather than committed capital.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The operating expenses is GBP 73 million, include GBP 22 million of the GBP 25 million implementation costs.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Investments of GBP 131 million is lower than last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It includes the completions of GEKA, the final reinvestments in Eurofund V and Blue Interactive, the first investment made by our Brazil team.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The M&A market has been quiet through most of the period, and we have stayed cautious about new investment in Europe.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We generated realization proceeds of GBP 165 million as an uplift over opening value of 15.",1095
18511,"2012m11","4%, and that represents an aggregate money multiple of 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","9x, generating realized profits of GBP 22 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've given much more detail about realizations during the period in our announcement today, and in the appendix to the slides.",1095
18511,"2012m11","In Private Equity, it is worth noting the disposal of Esmalglass, the Spanish investment was sold at a small uplift over the March value and at a money multiple of 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The Spanish portfolio now accounts for just 5% of the group's total.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The next slide gives you a picture of the diversity of the Private Equity portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","From a geographic perspective, our strongest performers continue to be in Northern Europe and the Americas.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Those regions make up 58% of the portfolio and have generated GBP 52 million of value growth in the period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There are small number of assets in Europe which are more challenging, and we're cautious about the outlook for the French portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The French portfolio is now valued at GBP 216 million or 7% of the total.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The more recent vintages now account for 30% of the total portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Performance is not uniformly positive, but it's in those vintages from 2010 onwards that we've seen some very positive earnings growth with corresponding uplifts in value in the period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The 2007 to 2009 vintages were more stable in this period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","They're accounting for 66% of the portfolio and generating a value increase of GBP 53 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Now in the past, we've provided additional disclosure to give you a view on the trajectory of portfolio performance, taking accounts of commercial considerations and confidentiality obligations, and it's fair to say, with varying degrees of success.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This slide gives an indicator performance on an aggregate basis by comparing earnings performance versus the prior year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Blue line shows you the percentage by number of companies.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You have better earnings performance than last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So for the portfolio at 30th of September, just over 55% of companies are better, and they account for 70% of the value, and that's a steady performance since March.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Breaking this picture down to a company level, this slide gives an indication of the performance of our largest assets.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This is a positive picture, with a significant majority performance ahead of last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And you'll see from the additional information in the announcement, 35% of companies had growth of more than 10%; 24% of companies generated growth of more than 20%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So overall, the performance of the portfolio is better than it has been in our most recent periods.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And that improved portfolio performance is reflected in the valuations in the first half.",1095
18511,"2012m11","As I mentioned earlier, even though equity markets have been volatile, they actually finished broadly flat in the period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And the multiples used to value the portfolio were also similarly flat, increasing by only 1%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","For this reporting period, we typically use the last 12 months accounts to June as a basis of valuation, but we use forecast earnings if they're lower than the last 12 months to June.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And 16 companies, 27%, were valued using current year forecast earnings.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Aggregate earnings used to value the portfolio, including those on forecast, grew by 1%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But on a valuated basis, earnings used to value the portfolio, grew by 9%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And as you might expect, the leverage in the portfolio valid using earnings fell to 3.",1095
18511,"2012m11","3x net debt to EBITDA multiple.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That was thanks to this better performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So bringing these data points together into the makeup of the unrealized value movement to GBP 66 million, you can see that the most material component relates to performance.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The positive but small movements of GBP 4 million in provisions is the net effect of 3 companies, each movements being less than GBP 10 million.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And so that's not indicative of the wider trend.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Finally, the industry metric category includes ACR, our Asian reinsurance business, which continues to be impacted by the effects of the Thai floods at the end of 2011.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Turning then to the balance sheet, and in particular to the gross debt reduction and the capital allocation model that Simon talked about earlier.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Key part of the strategic review we've just completed was to reduce the gross debt by using our cash resources.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We have been reducing gross  debt since its peak of GBP 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","7 billion in March 2009, but it's the simplification of the business model and more direct central control that mean we can take the next significant step.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We started the year with GBP 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","6 billion of gross debt and sets target to reduce its GBP 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","3 billion by the 30th of September and then reduce it further to GBP 1 billion by June 2013.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Gross debt at the end of the period was GBP 1.",1095
18511,"2012m11","2 billion, so we are ahead of our intermediate target.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've done that through a combination of scheduled maturities, but also by being opportunistic in making some early repayments.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Gross interest for the period of GBP 60 million includes GBP 20 million of accelerated interest costs.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I expect that the full year charge will be marginally less than last financial year and importantly, that the run rate of net interest payable at the start of next year will be nearer to GBP 60 million for the full year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we are ahead of our original plan, and I am confident that we're on track to meet the GBP 1 billion target by June 2013.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This is particularly important.",1095
18511,"2012m11","It's not only important because of the impact on the run rate of interest, but also because of its link to our capital allocation and distribution policy.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The target capital allocation framework that we set out in June, which Simon has just restated, means we will deploy more of our capital to shareholder distribution and to investment in our core businesses over time.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The quality of realizations in the period has been good but, as we had expected, lower in absolute terms than in prior years.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That reduction and realizations, together with a significant progress we're making to reduce gross debt, means there was a net cash outflow of GBP 390 million in the period.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Of course, repayments of gross debt has no impact on net debt or gearing.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Net debt increased only marginally from GBP 464 million to GBP 493 million and gearing went from 18% to 19%.",1095
18511,"2012m11","That's another important factor in our capital distribution policy.",1095
18511,"2012m11","To remind you what we set out in May.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We rebased our dividend to 8.",1095
18511,"2012m11","1p per share this time last year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","And we defined the basis of aggregate shareholders distributions as 15% to 20% of gross cash proceeds from realizations, provided that gearing is less than 20%, and that we're on target to have gross debt less than GBP 1 billion by June 2013.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We also indicated that realizations were likely to be lower in this financial year, and the first half performance is consistent with that lower forecast.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Therefore it's still the case, but it will be next financial year before you should expect any meaningful increase in shareholder distribution.",1095
18511,"2012m11","1p levels set last year should be seen as a base for the dividend.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we announced today an interim dividend of 2.",1095
18511,"2012m11","7p per share, with an intention to pay 8.",1095
18511,"2012m11","1p per share as the total dividend for the year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So before I hand back to Simon to wrap up, I'll just quickly summarize the results for the 6 months of 30th of September, 2012.",1095
18511,"2012m11","This has been a period of very considerable change, a lot of which is reflected in the numbers and some of which will take longer to prove its potential.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We've made good progress in restructuring the business, and we've seen a degree of stability in the underlying performance of the portfolio.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The total return loss of GBP 5 million reflects its better performance from our Private Equity portfolio and steady contributions from Infrastructure and Debt Management, as well as the cost of restructuring.",1095
18511,"2012m11","The balance sheet remains strong, and the progress that we've made in reducing gross debt will improve returns and cash flow from next year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","All of this has created a leaner business and prepares us for increased shareholder distributions as the level of our realizations improved.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I'll now hand back to Simon.",1095
18511,"2012m11","Yes, and although you had quite a high proportion of forward earnings you were using, presumably quite a low proportion of the valuation based on those forward earnings? Well, I think, as Simon has just said, we are reasonably cautious about the European environment.",1095
18511,"2012m11","By using the forecast earnings, we're trying to anticipate some of that, but we're not taking any further forward in the end of September.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we will all have to see how the European environment develops over the turn of the calendar year.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I think on the portfolio review, I'm comfortable with where the thing is valued.",1095
18511,"2012m11","You've seen from the realization total in the release today that we've effectively made realizations of -- ahead of the marks we had in our book.",1095
18511,"2012m11","There are a good spread of companies.",1095
18511,"2012m11","I guess the concerning thing is that the overwhelming majority of the investment is in Europe.",1095
18511,"2012m11","We see 2013 being pretty tricky in Europe for all sorts of reasons, and that would affect some of the Northern European countries, and the country we are worried about is France.",1095
18511,"2012m11","So we will see some headwinds in that regard.",1095
18511,"2012m11","But in general, we're very comfortable with the general state of the portfolio, but of the well-known problem that you all know about -- but apart from that, the bulk of the value is really in some pretty good companies.",1095
18511,"2012m5","Thank you, Adrian and good morning, everybody.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As I take you through the financial results of the group for the year ended 31st of March 2012, there are 3 key areas that I want to focus on: the performance of our portfolio and how it is developed through the year, the progress we have made regarding our operating cost base and the priority we have given to managing our balance sheet and our ability, as a consequence, to enhance direct returns to shareholders.",1087
18511,"2012m5","A quick summary first of the key financials for the year before moving to the aspects and return detailed.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Gross portfolio return of minus 8.",1087
18511,"2012m5","2% on opening portfolio value is driven by lower-than-normal realized profits, valuation write-downs reflecting lower multiples, some underperformance in the portfolio and a net fall in the portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Our model has seen dilution from gross portfolio return to net portfolio return as a result of our net operating costs, and I'll need the next slide to talk through how each of our business lines have performed.",1087
18511,"2012m5","When growth returns are below our target levels, there is no gearing benefit from net debt.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And so the total return of minus 19.",1087
18511,"2012m5","5% reflects the dilution of our net interest cost.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It also reflects the impact of the pension fund valuation, which we settled at the half year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In keeping with the distribution policy we announced in November, the board has confirmed its intention to pay a final dividend of 5.",1087
18511,"2012m5","4p per share subject to shareholder approval, making a total dividend for the year of 8.",1087
18511,"2012m5","1p per share and a cash cost of GBP 75 million.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I will comment on the evolution of our distribution policy later in this presentation.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Our assets under management have reduced in the year Clearly, realizations contributed to this.",1087
18511,"2012m5","However, the more material factor is the effect of the end of Eurofund V investment period when we switched from including the total commitment to the amount invested, and this is offset somewhat by new funds in Debt Management.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Finally, we remain selective with new investments, and I'm pleased to say that investments we've made in recent vintages are showing good performance overall.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And realizations of GBP 771 million provide real evidence of the the strength of our portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The money multiple of the 10 most material transactions averaged 2.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As I set out in the half year, we've enhanced our disclosure to include net portfolio return by business line.",1087
18511,"2012m5","79% of our balance sheet is invested in the private equity portfolio, and so the performance of that business line is dominated by the gross portfolio returns.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'll be talking shortly in more detail about the drivers of the GBP 339 million negative return in the year and operating costs more generally.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Our infrastructure business continues to perform well.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The gross portfolio return of GBP 11 million includes an increase of GBP 22 million in the value of our 34% holding in 3i Infrastructure plc as well as GBP 18 million of dividends received on our stake.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As Cressida Hogg explained in detail when announcing the results of 3i last week, strong performance in its European investments have been offset by reduction in the valuation of our investments, which we hold for the India Infrastructure Fund.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This is principally due to currency and specifically the share price performance of the power.",1087
18511,"2012m5","However, the operational performance of the Indian portfolio is in line with expectations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Importantly from the 3i group perspective, the gross returns from 3iN are enhanced with fee income of GBP 25 million resulting in a 2.",1087
18511,"2012m5","8% return over opening book value.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Group investments in infrastructure included GBP 33 million in the exercise of 3iN's warrants, and it also included GBP 28 million of balance sheet investments in LIN and Nordic electricity and heating distribution network business, which we made alongside 3iN.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Debt Management is our newest business line and performance since the acquisition of the business 12 months ago has been very strong.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The results here reflect the fact that this business line is in development.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So last year's return benefited from the realization at the original debt warehouse.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And when you look at the net portfolio return of the business, it's worth noting that carry on cost lines include GBP 6 million of acquisition accounting adjustments.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Excluding these, the underlying return is GBP 9 million, somewhat better than presented here.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But most significantly, dynamic investment management has meant that fees have accrued more quickly than we had planned.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And as a consequence, cash generated by the business has already covered the original acquisition costs.",1087
18511,"2012m5","continues to look at growth opportunities for the business to provide further fee income and return to the group.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Returning then to the 3 most significant elements of our returns in more detail, namely: portfolio performance, operating costs and the return of our conservative balance sheet strategy.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I want to take you through the performance the portfolio as a whole and then how that's reflected in our valuation.",1087
18511,"2012m5","At the highest level and not surprisingly, our portfolio performance reflects the markets and the macroenvironment in which it operates and the prevailing market conditions that existed when investments were made.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In the private equity portfolio, which accounts for 79% of the total, we have seen strong growth in Northern Europe and the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5",", which is where we have targeted investments made since 2009.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Northern Europe has provided our strongest realizations in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Conversely, we have seen in Spain, the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","and more recently France, which has impacted performance in the year, and Simon will talk through these aspects in more detail later.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you'd expect, our infrastructure portfolio has been much less impacted by European macroissues and the portfolio continues to perform well.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As a result, materially all of the reduction in portfolio value is attributable to the private equity business and within that, 2/3 relates to the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Spanish and French assets.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In current while we have taken the opportunity to realize investments, we have achieved a good money multiple, 2.",1087
18511,"2012m5","9x on the largest 10 sales, 7 of which were based in Northern Europe.",1087
18511,"2012m5","To give you some quantification then of overall performance, we have seen earnings growth in the portfolio of 9% in the 12 months December 2011 on a value weighted basis, and you can see here how that's spread across the portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","By value, 80% of the portfolio grew its earning and 42% by more than 10% in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The last 2 vintages have performed better than average with value weighted earnings growth of 20% in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Now it's clear from discussions with shareholders and analysts that there is a strong desire for greater deal -- detail on the performance of individual portfolio companies and as a whole.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have to balance this appetite with our confidentiality obligations to the private companies in which we invest and take account of disclosure restrictions imposed on minority investment positions.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So we're therefore providing some new disclosure in the appendix of this presentation at the individual company level for the top 25 assets, but on an anonymous basis.",1087
18511,"2012m5","These assets account for 66% of the whole portfolio value.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have provided you revenue data to give a sense of scale and earnings growth data to demonstrate momentum.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'm sure you'll want to look at these later in detail.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But it shows for example that of the top 25, 20 grew earnings in the year and 9 by more than 10%.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So let me now turn to how that performance is reflected in the valuations in the 31st of March.",1087
18511,"2012m5","At the 31st of March, the earnings used in our valuations typically are based on the management accounts of companies to the 31st of December.",1087
18511,"2012m5","However, where we expect future earnings to be lower than those in December -- the December 2011 management accounts, we use the forecast earnings.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have used forecast earnings for only 8% of companies in the portfolio at March.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This is an improvement in the position at the 30th of September when 23% of companies was valued on this basis and 31st of March 2011 when the number was 12%.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Of course, multiples are the other significant driver of valuations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The weighted average EBITDA multiple was 7% lower in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Although the market was volatile in the year, equivalent sectors and geographies follow the net basis by about the same amount.",1087
18511,"2012m5","However, in a number of cases particularly in geographies with more challenging economic conditions, we have also reduced the multiple to a greater degree than the comparable set.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And as result, the weighted average EBITDA multiple for the portfolio valued on an earnings basis was 8.",1087
18511,"2012m5","2x pre-discount and 7.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So the effect of that underlying earnings and multiple movement can be seen here in the earnings multiples and impairment lines.",1087
18511,"2012m5","To be clear, impairments are simply the impact of earnings-based valuation on the debt elements in our capitals structure.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Other factors to note include provisions of GBP 138 million, which relates to 6 companies across a range of geographies and sectors.",1087
18511,"2012m5","2 of the 6 are in Spain, with one significant provision of GBP 83 million relating to Hess, our renewable power service provider.",1087
18511,"2012m5","About half of this write-down on Hess has been recognized at the half year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The value of the portfolio fell by 20 million in total, but includes the increase of 3iN of GBP 22 million offset by reductions in our investments in Power, which is post the Indian infrastructure portfolio and Capital, a U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","growth capital investment which last year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The most significant item in the industry metric category relates to our investment in ACR, the Singaporean-based Asian reinsurance business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This is heavily impacted by the Thai floods at the end of calendar 2011, and this led to value movements of GBP 29 million.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Finally, it's worth noting spread across the categories is GBP 47 million of value movement relating to dividends in the portfolio, and these are included elsewhere in returns as income.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Looking then to the effect of these unrealized value movements have had on the balance sheet value.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We started the year with the portfolio value of GBP 4 billion, new investments of GBP 374 million in the year in 9 companies, further investments of GBP 109 million in the existing portfolio and capitalized interest increased the portfolio by GBP 646 million.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The body of assets sold was GBP 748 million, and the unrealized value movement that I've just been talking about reduced the portfolio by GBP 498 million.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you know, we partially hedge currency movements, and a weakening of the euro and rupee in particular in the year gave rise to a net FX loss of GBP 49 million in our total return.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The gross impact in the portfolio is a GBP 101 million movement that you can see here.",1087
18511,"2012m5","At the end of the year, we had a portfolio of GBP 3.",1087
18511,"2012m5","2 billion, 79% of which relates to the private equity portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Of the private equity portfolio by vintage, the proportion of the portfolio relating to investments made after 2009 has now increased from 10% to 28%.",1087
18511,"2012m5","69% is focused on Northern Europe, U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","and Asia where the macro environment is more positive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And within Southern Europe, the proportion of the private equity portfolio in Spain is now only 7%, down from 11% last year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","At the half year announcement in November, we detailed each business lines' net portfolio return for the first time, allowing visibility across our key business measure.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We announced in March that to provide more transparency regarding the performance of the business, particularly against the volatile market backdrop, we will provide a quarterly NAV update, which will start in July for the quarter ending the 30th of June.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And today, we have included our presentation a press release for the new disclosure that seeks to provide more comprehensive detail and information about our key portfolio companies.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In addition to that as I've already talked about, we are also providing additional commentary regarding our top 10 assets, which account for 43% of the portfolio, to make clear our investment strategy and view on current performance.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Further information regarding earnings growth, net debt levels and refinancing across the portfolio as a multiple of original cost achieved in our largest 10 assets in the period.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We believe that this increased level of disclosure will allow shareholders to be more able -- to more clearly track and understand our progress.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The second area I want to focus on today is costs.",1087
18511,"2012m5","There's been considerable commentary about the operating costs base in recent months, and so I want to give you some more detail on costs, what has been achieved to date in reducing them and what is planned in the next 12 months.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you can see from this chart, we have made significant progress in reducing our cost base.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The peak run rate during the year ended the 31st of March 2008 was GBP 290 million with 788 people.",1087
18511,"2012m5","By the 31st of March 2012, operating costs are 38% lower and GBP 180 million and headcount has reduced to 435.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And this reduction is despite the addition of 30 people in the Debt Management business and 8 people in Brazil.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In November 2011, we announced the changes to our private equity team and indicated that we expected as result to reduce costs by at least GBP 15 million.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Since completing those changes and taking account the consequent changes to support services and property requirements, we expect the annualized benefit of these measures to be GBP 25 million in 2012.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Finally, the third area I said I'll focus on today is the effect of the conservative balance sheet management strategy on our total return.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Following the rights issue in 2009, we set some parameters within which to manage liquidity, net debt and gross debt and manage gearing.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have held high levels of liquidity throughout the period of economic uncertainty, which has not recovered in any sustained way since 2009.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The liquidity is set to ensure that we're able to meet our fund commitments, debt and pension obligations and meet the running cost of the business for 2 years assuming that there are no realizations and that refinancing is unavailable.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This is conservative.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But there have been several occasions in the last 2 years when refinancing markets have shut and in the last 6 months, we have had times when realizations appear to have slowed dramatically.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But this conservatism does have a cost.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Gross interest payable was GBP 103 million in the year ended 31st of March 2012.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So to address this, we have been reducing the amount of gross debt and extending its maturity.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you can see from this chart, gross debt has reduced from its peak of GBP 2.",1087
18511,"2012m5","6 billion in 2009 to GBP 1.",1087
18511,"2012m5","6 billion at the 31st of March 2012, a 21% reduction in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have decided not to refinance the outstanding maturity of our FRN, which matures in June.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As a consequence of that and other scheduled repayments, expect gross debt to fall by at least another 20% to GBP 1.",1087
18511,"2012m5","3 million at the 30th of September.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And because the finance that matures in the next 6 months is somewhat cheaper financing, interest will not fall by the same level as gross debt.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But all other things being equal, I expect it to be of the order of GBP 90 million in this year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And of that GBP 90 million, GBP 52 million relates to our long-dated debt repayable in 2017, 2023 and 2032.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Now, it's Board's intention that we continue this trajectory with a target of reducing gross debt to less than GBP 1 billion by June 2013 and thereafter, we will limits.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This continued focus also means that the level of gearing at 18% at 31st of March remains within our expected rates of north of 30%.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So the significant progress we've made in reducing our debt and maintaining our conservative balance sheet approach through volatile financing and M&A markets has provided the flexibility for the board to make further progress in defining intent to allocate its capital and provide returns to shareholders.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We announced the rebasing of the dividend in November and consistent with that, have today confirmed the final dividend of 5.",1087
18511,"2012m5","4p per share, a total dividend payout of 8.",1087
18511,"2012m5","1p per share subject to shareholder approval.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This was an important step in determining the appropriate allocation of capital between returns to shareholders and our investment opportunities.",1087
18511,"2012m5","At the time of making that distribution, we were not specific about defining the basis of distribution.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Today, we set out the parameters, which will define our future distribution policy, strengthening it in order to give shareholders a direct share in the success of the group's realization activities.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Providing gearing remains less than 20%, the Board therefore intends to distributed to shareholders further amounts such as the total distribution in the year, including the regular dividend, represents between 15% and 20% of gross cash realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The method of distribution will depend on a number of factors, including the size of the distribution and the share price, but may include special dividend, use of the spending in share buyback authority or other capital distribution methods.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In the next 12 months, our priority will be the reduction of gross debt, and you may expect to implement of this new policy progressively in the life of the performance the business, progress in implanting the Chief Executive's strategic mandate and the strength of the group's cash flow.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So currently expect realizations for this year to be lower than the GBP 771 million that we received last year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I do not expect any additional distribution will be made in this calendar year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The board firmly believes that this policy provides a comprehensive and flexible means of ensuring that shareholders participate directly in the returns to the group, and we will update shareholders on progress that we're making towards the new distribution policy as well as reducing gross debt on .",1087
18511,"2012m5","a half yearly basis.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So to summarize, the portfolio performance reflects a period of market and political volatility, but there is evidence of the performance in the more recent vintages.",1087
18511,"2012m5","However, stability in the Eurozone with all its implications will be critical for sustained improvement.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have continued our focus on operating efficiency with tangible results evident in reduced operating costs and expectation of further reduction next year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Our conservative balance sheet strategy has provided strength in fragile markets, but we have taken further steps to reduce its dilutive effect on returns.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And as result of our progress in managing the balance sheet, we have today announced measures to enhance our distribution policy giving shareholders direct participation in our cash realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So thank you, and I'll now hand over to Simon.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this Presentation although this is formally the announcement of our results for the financial year March 2012, it has been a busy period since the year end.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And we would like to take you through the considerable progress we have made since March, including this morning's announcement of 3i's new Chief Executive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The agenda for today's meeting is set out on this slide coming up.",1087
18511,"2012m5","First of all, I will outline to the strategic mandate that the board has agreed with Simon and describe the process that we undertook that led to disappointment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Julia will then provide an update on the financial performance of the group through the year through 31st March 2012 and discuss portfolio performance, costs and management of the balance sheet.",1087
18511,"2012m5","She will also provide greater detail on the proposed return of capital and the parameters under which these returns will take place.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Julia will hand over to Simon, who will briefly introduce himself and reflect on the impressions he has formed of 3i since joining late last year, before setting out how he intends to implement the strategic mandate given to him by the board.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Now since the year end, I have been consulting widely with our largest shareholders to obtain their views on 4 key identified by the board as needing further attention.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'm very grateful to the shareholders for their feedback regarding both the process we have followed in appointing Simon and in setting -- settling the mandate that he and the Board have agreed.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So to take each area in turn.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you know, we have been seeking to diversify the business from its core focus on private equity, building on the successful track record of our infrastructure business and acquiring a Debt Management business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The aspiration has to be a diversified asset manager with more stable and visible revenue streams.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have also consulted on the steps we have been taking to implementing the strategy.",1087
18511,"2012m5","First as regards to shape and location of our investment teams, we recognize that each of our markets and the geographies in which we work are continually changing.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Activity levels in the Europe end market have not recovered, but the new management in the private equity business is making good progress in refocusing that business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Infrastructure is an attractive asset class, and we have made excellent progress in a highly competitive market and there are attractive consolidation of in Debt Management.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have, however, asked Simon as our new Chief Executive to determine the best shape and investment strategy for the business going forward in the light of the resources available to us.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Second, costs.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have made a lot of progress in reducing costs under Michael's leadership.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Costs are approximately GBP 110 million lower than 3 years ago.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But there is more to do, and Simon will be addressing this alongside determining the right shape of the business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The next area was to review the allocation of capital between return to shareholders and investment opportunities, taking into account the group's balance sheet position and the availability and attractiveness of investment opportunities, both external and in shares.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I do not want to preempt the Julia's presentation of the conclusions that the board has reached and the parameters that have been set for future returns of capital.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I would like to say, however, that we have listened carefully to the feedback we have received and formulated our proposals with a view to aligning our shareholders to participate directly in the value flowing from realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Finally, there is a communications point that I have discussed with shareholders.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We are a U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","listed company followed by U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","analysts with a register made up substantially of U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","investors and widely commented on by the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So it's natural that the performance of our U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","assets that includes many household names, tends to overshadow the investments we have on the continent, which have been amongst our strongest performers.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So in order to show our investment performance in a proper perspective, we have today implemented a new approach to disclosure, in which we are getting more information about the performance with the more significant investments in our portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","That brings me to the appointment of our new Chief Executive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you all know, the board began a process to identify a successor to Michael at the end of March following the announcement of his intention to step down as Chief Executive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The board had a very clear view of our characteristics that we are seeking in our new Chief Executive, and this seemed to match the views of those institutional shareholders we consulted.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It was against this backdrop that the Nominations Committee began a process in which it considered both internal and external candidates.",1087
18511,"2012m5","A long list of well over a dozen candidates was reduced to a short list of 4, and it is with great pleasure that we have been able to announce today the appointment of Simon of our new -- as our new Chief Executive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Many of you will already know Simon, but I shall introduce him formally.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Simon has been Chief Investment Officer and a member of the board of 3i since he joined the company in October last year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Prior to joining 3i, he was Chairman of Greenhill & Co International LLP, having previously being co-Chief Executive of Greenhill & Co Inc.",1087
18511,"2012m5",", a leading independent investment bank listed on the New York Stock Exchange.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Before founding the European operations of Greenhill in 1998, Simon was the Managing Director of Baring Brothers International Limited.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So Simon already knows the business well, and he has a clear view of the priorities.",1087
18511,"2012m5","He will need some time, of course, to prepare detailed plans for the future.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But the board has endeavored to set out, in conjunction with Simon, a set of clear tangible and credible initiatives with a view to determining 3i's future path.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The next step therefore, is to ensure that we have stable platform from which to move the business forward.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We'd like to put an end to the recent uncertainty that has affected the firm and to seek a powerful demonstration that the shareholders are willing to give their full support to Simon and to the plans that we are outlining today.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have therefore, decided to bring our Annual General Meeting forward to 29th of June.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Thereafter, our priority will be to execute our strategy to improve performance and to deliver long-term shareholder value, and I'll now hand over to Julia.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Hi, it's Bruce Hamilton Morgan Stanley.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Just to get on the reduction in the gross debt of GBP 600 million, should we read it the basically that, that will just be paid out of gross cash? Or do you expect that sort of net realizations will play into that? Or are you signaling actually you're a lot of investment bring the gross debt down? That wasn't entirely clear to me, the components of how you pay that GBP 600 million back.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Well, there's currently 2 prescriptive about it.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Clearly, we have to balance, and we have to make sure that the cash flows work.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But we have a number of ongoing commitments existing funds, India Infrastructure Fund, our Growth Capital fund.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have some New York in Debt Management, and we have a new team in Brazil who are looking to invest.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So balancing all of those things, we have existing commitments to our private equity portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Part of that growth is about further investments into that portfolio as well.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So all of that goes into mix.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I mean, it's fair to say in terms of calendar Q1 trading data, we've seen some positive indications in performance overall.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And you'll see some of the effect of that coming through when we do our quarterly NAV update in July.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I would say clearly x stable markets, it would be easy to be more confident about how much of that actually projects forward in terms of the overall look for the portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And we clearly don't have that at the moment on continued volatility markets will drive multiples as well.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But early indications in that Q1 trading data is reasonably positive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's Andrew Bell from investment trusts.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'd just be interested to hear a little bit of color on how you decided upon 15% or 20% distribution ratio, or put another way, an intention to retain 80% or 85%? And whether that's at all contingent on where the shares are trading in relation to the net asset value? I wonder can you say a little bit about what your companies are actually telling you now.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Because you're seeing a very difficult and changeable economic environment, and a lot of your commentary relates to the end of December.",1087
18511,"2012m5","What have you seen since -- what have you actually being seeing now that we're now talking about the Greek exit again? Thank you very much, Simon.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you can see, Simon knows, has 3i a long time and knows the business very well.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's an important date for 3i.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have a new Chief Executive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We announced a clear concrete set of measures to take 3i forward,and we are delighted to take any of your questions.",1087
18511,"2012m5","There's microphones.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Let us have your name and organization.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think Simon's opening remarks, well clearly for Philip to go first, that will only just appropriate.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Who would like to start? I mean, the good thing about having a Debt Management business is, as we've talked about is, as the fees come off in over period in terms of the private equity business, Jeremy has done a fantastic job in terms of building the business and actually increasing the fee income.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And he has number of growth opportunities that he's looking at that we will hope will mainly continue to see improvement in fees servicing next year, and those fees will come off in terms of private equity business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","From Barclays here.",1087
18511,"2012m5","couple of quick questions.",1087
18511,"2012m5","You seem to have moved from previously saying a GBP 1 billion target for net debt to now indicating that the GBP 1 billion target at a gross debt level.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I was wondering if could give more color on how you determine that to be the appropriate figure at gross debt level? And why, what was behind the decision not to roll particularly your June 12 FRN? Second question on the sort of capital returns policy, can you give more color on why the level of realization shared with shareholders has been determined at 15% to 20% level? What was thought process that went into that decision? Chris Brown from JPMorgan.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Just a quick question on fee income.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Obviously with going on cost basis, can you say what effect that will have on an ongoing basis with fee income? One more.",1087
18511,"2012m5","You did comment on in calendar 2012 that additional returns were unlikely because of the gross debt paid down.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But's intention is to despite whatever the gearing level might be to pay that ordinary dividends level, isn't it? Is that correct? Yes, that's fine.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I mean, as I said in my presentation, the gross debt costs GBP 100 million a year at the moment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And it's imperative that we reduce that cost and improve the cash flow generation, the ongoing cash flow generation for the group, particularly when we want to increase our distribution policy.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So we look at our gross debt profile, we looked how to bring that down.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I mean, it's fair to say that getting to the GBP 1 billion is to an extend, inevitable.",1087
18511,"2012m5","When you look at the profile of our maturities, we will get to that in June and the GBP 1 billion roughly equates to our longer-term debt.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So where the maturities run through this year, we will be left with long-term debt, which at the moment is costing just over GBP 50 million a year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think that was the real focus.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In terms of giving prioritization to that gross debt, the board was clearly concerned to make sure that as we went into higher distribution policy that we had make sure that we still had a financially secure balance sheet for the ongoing importance of the business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In terms of setting the 15% to 20% range, we ran various scenarios.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And what we wanted to be able to do was make sure that we were showing clear intention for our shareholders to be able to participate in the success of the group, which is most visible when it comes to realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So that was the link to realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In terms of setting a level, we obviously have a view to the ongoing growth of the business and the ongoing investment opportunities of the business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So what we're trying to strike is a balance in terms of allowing shareholders to participate directly in returns, but also to be able to continue to invest in growing the business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think it was probably just one question, but the question is really whether the 80% retention ratio or reinvestment ratio, would be the same? What -- would it vary at all according to whether the shares were trading on the current 30%-plus discount, or whether they were trading closer to NAV? In other words, do you view it is sustainable for you to be reinvesting 80% if in 3 years' time, the shares are still trading at their current rating with the implied, I suppose -- I mean, we don't know what the market environment is going to be, but with the implied lack of confidence, which is inherent in that rating.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Yes, the intention is to maintain the regular dividend.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And what we're talking about here is defining the amount of any incremental distribution over and above that regular dividend.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And clearly we will look to progressions in terms of realizations through the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And as I have said, it's almost inevitable we will reduce gross debt, it is GBP 1.",1087
18511,"2012m5","6 billion at the start of the year, so GBP 600 million of cash to reduce it to GBP 1 billion.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And so that's why we're saying that we shouldn't anticipate any incremental distribution, certainly not in this calendar year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Iain Scouller for Morgan securities.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Julia, could you just give us a bit more color on the earnings growth figure.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think over the year, that added GBP 23 million to return.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But as you are showing in the earlier slides, I think the 80% portfolio actually saw earnings growth.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So that seems to be relatively lower return given that background.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Any more questions? If not, I think we can bring this presentation to a close.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Just thank you all very much for your attendance.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Thank you so much.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Well, we actually have to manage all of those components on a dynamic basis.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So I mean, I have a budget that anticipates a level of realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I have a budget that anticipates the level of investment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We said that where going to be selective about investments and that continues.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So we will see.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And we have cash in our balance sheet at the moment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We finished the year with liquidity of GBP 1.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So we will be using all of those moving parts that will determine exactly where we end up.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'm not sure I could give you any more color than I've already mentioned.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I mean, we have to strike a balance in allowing shareholders to participate in returns.",1087
18511,"2012m5","That's very important.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But realizations are lifeblood of organization.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Its work, funds investment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And so we had a look at our strategic plan, look at our plans for work, and those were the numbers that I think struck the right balance.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And that's where we have concluded.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And could you just repeat your second question? Maybe if I could jump in.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think we try to weigh up where we are today against where we might get to tomorrow.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And as I indicated in my discussion where we are today is that we have an imbalance between our income and our costs, and we have a significant interest build.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So I mean in the short term, we need to focus on those things, and we need to set a reasonable ambition for the distributions to shareholders.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Over time, we can clearly review that, and we can also review the opportunities in the market and where our shares might be trading at that time.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But as of today, we try to manage the situation that we see now and how we see it developing.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But we are, to a degree, in the hands of the macro as to realizations and the strength of that float.",1087
18511,"2012m5","so it's a little cautious, but it sets the right balance, I think.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Thanks, Julia, and good morning, everyone.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The last time I took to a platform to speak for 3i was at the the company flotation in 1994.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And I'm delighted to see there are 1 or 2 familiar faces here.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We've got Richard Somers, who was on the board at that time; Philip Middleton sitting down there and Ian Scouller, who were both covering the company at the time.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But 3i was very different in those days.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It was mainly a U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","-based business operating at as of about 20 local offices.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The debenture business in the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","was running down its portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The total 3i portfolio had approximately 3 billion of value, and there was little debt in the portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The portfolio yielded about 7%, comfortably paying for the cost of the business and an attractive dividend to shareholders.",1087
18511,"2012m5","There are about 3,400 individual investments, and they averaged around GBP 1 million in size.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Generally, the investments were passive in nature.",1087
18511,"2012m5","There is relatively few buyers.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And by the way, the stock market was as strictly then as it is today.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Today, the group could not be more different.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have offices all over the world and only one investment office of this in the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have approximately 100 core investments, and we control nearly half of them by value together with our external managed funds.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I say control because we tend to have a majority of the equity, but it sits on top of quite a lot of leverage.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We now have 3 strong capabilities, private equity, infrastructure investing and Debt Management.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The group manages more of its own funds today as well as core third-party funds.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But in general, the investments after interest costs provide a much lower cash yield than they did in 1994.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'm looking at the challenging world today.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We are much better placed to prosper from our 3 capabilities in mid-market private equity, infrastructure and Debt Management than we would have been if we had remained a U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","private equity business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The international network gives us true competitive advantage in important geographies like Northern Europe and India as well as the group's traditional base in the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think it's fair to say that we currently have an imbalance between our costs, and our income.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's also fair to say that we have a difficult legacy portfolio from the peak years of 2007 to 2009.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But these are issues we can deal with in the coming years.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And in doing that, we can create a 3i which will be more focused and a lot leaner.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We should then be capable of producing strong cash returns for our shareholders and our limited partners, by using our deep sector expertise and a more focused international footprint.",1087
18511,"2012m5","After Michael approached me last year, I agreed to join 3i as CIO in October because I thought it sounded like a fascinating world, and I certainly haven't been disappointed.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The range of people, the range of investments and the sorts of issues we're dealing with have surpassed my expectations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's been both stimulating and challenging right from the first day.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The team at 3i want to get back to the top of their game, and I have little doubt they're up to the challenges ahead.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Now I'd like to give you some of my perspective on the current business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have a direct private equity portfolio of some 2.",1087
18511,"2012m5","5 billion spread across these geographies, and I have managed to get round a good number of these offices in the last 6 months.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In the main, I've been very impressed with the teams that I spent time with.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The traffic lights indicate my assessment of the portfolios by geography.",1087
18511,"2012m5","You can clearly see the problems we have in Southern Europe, and Spain has been particularly tough for us over the last 12 months.",1087
18511,"2012m5","You can also see the strength of our portfolios in Northern Europe, as well as a good portfolio in the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have recruited a first-rate team in Brazil, which looks to be promising from a fund-raising point of view as well as an investment point of view.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Another observation I would make is that many of the challenged investments from 2007 to 2009 came out of the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","and the Spanish offices.",1087
18511,"2012m5","A well-established teams in Germany, Benelux and France have in the main invested at a steady rate in familiar sectors, and they have far fewer problems in their portfolios.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Now the macro is still very difficult and uncertain but in these geographies, we have good teams, and we have robust portfolios.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So what about our sector capabilities? If you take a long-term perspective, 3i has generated very good returns from these 4 sectors and they now dominate the portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In our strong offices, we tend to have up to a dozen professionals with a good blend of operational and financial skills.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Each team will typically be headed by 2 partners.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Let me give you a few examples of our skill set.",1087
18511,"2012m5","If you are the CIO at 3i and your German team brings you an industrial proposal, you know it will be interesting and well thought through.",1087
18511,"2012m5","You also know that it will be capable of producing good returns.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The same can be said of consumer in Benelux or France or the testing and inspection unit out of our London team.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And I don't lose much sleep if Cressida and her team turn up with an infrastructure proposal, which brings me on to infrastructure.",1087
18511,"2012m5","3i is world-class at infrastructure investing.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I don't need to dwell on this portfolio, but I would like us to do more in infrastructure and continue to bulk up this portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I like the long-term and cash-generative characteristics of the majority of our investments in this area.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In Debt Management, we continue to grow third-party funds.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Today, total AUM is now approaching GBP 3.",1087
18511,"2012m5","4 billion, and it's scalable from here.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Debt Management makes a significant contribution to our operating cash flow.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Jeremy and his team performed impressively last year, and he knows I'm keen he keeps up the momentum this year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Let me talk about some new investments.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Apart from a good number of quality bolt-on acquisitions for our portfolio companies, I've chaired the Investment Committee 4 times over the last 6 months looking at new investments, 2 private equity investments and 2 infrastructure investments.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I've also turned away a number of other proposals, because we try to be highly selective in this very tricky environment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This short list illustrates pretty well 3i's sector capabilities and international reach, which is so important in these challenging times.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In private equity we have invested in GEKA, a German manufacturer, which is the world technological leader in mascara brushes.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And we backed a roll up cable-TV operator in Brazil called Blue Interactive Group.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And in infrastructure, we have invested in the second-largest electricity distribution network in Finland, a new road concessions.",1087
18511,"2012m5","There are very few of our competitors who could have produced 4 such varied and attractive investment opportunities in this environment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","My last 2 slides give you an idea about our priorities around asset management and around our investment processes as well as I -- as well where I will be focusing initially as CEO.",1087
18511,"2012m5","You can see from Slide 32 where we have concentrated over recent months.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Slide 33 shows our focus going forward.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Our cost on our balance sheet will be critical areas for us.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Everybody at 3i gets that we have to demonstrate our investing and asset management skills to shareholders and to LPs.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We are confident that our recent portfolio of investments will do just that.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We are also confident that our shareholders and LPs will enjoy strong cash on cash returns, and these -- as these investments mature and are realized.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Thank you for your time.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We'd be happy to take questions.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think you should direct the difficult ones at Julia and the Chairman, but I'll take the easy ones.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Yes, it's important to note that the numbers that we give you, so the 9% overall growth is a value weighted number.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So you will understand that including a value weighted number, we don't include the effect of earnings, which are for companies which have a low or no value.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So the aggregate earnings growth for those companies that are valued on on earnings basis is actually 2%, which instinctively correlates back to that GBP 23 million number that you have in your return.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Say, you're expecting clearly in the market environment, realizations will be down year-over-year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Would you be roughly managing investments to a similar rate as realizations? Or is that wrong way to think about things? Philip? I wonder can you say a little bit about what your companies are actually telling you now, because you say it's a very difficult and changeable economic environment, and a lot of your commentary relates to the end of December.",1087
18511,"2012m5","What have you seen since then? And what actually have you seen since we're now talking about the Greek exit again? [indiscernible] It's Andrew Bell from Witan Investment Trust.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'd just be interested to hear a little bit of color on how you decided upon a 15% or 20% distribution ratio, or to put another way, an intention to retain 80% or 85% and whether that's at all contingent on where the shares are trading in relation to the net asset value.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Maybe if I could jump in.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think we try to weigh up where we are today against where we might get to tomorrow.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And as I indicated in my discussion, where we are today is that we have an imbalance between our income and our costs, and we have a significant interest build.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So I mean in the short term, we need to focus on those things, and we need to set a reasonable ambition for the distributions to shareholders.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Over time, we can clearly review that, and we can also review the opportunities in the market and where our shares might be trading at that time.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But as of today, we try to manage the situation that we see now and how we see it developing, but we are, to a degree, in the hands of the macro as to realizations and the strength of that flow.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So it's a little cautious, but it sets the right balance, I think.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Trying to follow up with one more.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The -- you did comment on, in calendar 2012, the additional returns were unlikely because of the gross debt paydown.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But certainly, the intention still, despite whatever the gearing level might be, to pay that ordinary dividend level.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Is that correct? Thanks, Julia, and good morning, everyone.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The last time I took to a platform to speak for 3i was at the company flotation in 1994, and I'm delighted to see there are 1 or 2 familiar faces here.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We've got Richard Summers, who was on the board at that time; Philip Middleton, who's sitting down there; and Iain Scouller, who were both covering the company at the time.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But 3i was very different in those days.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It was mainly a U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","-based business operating at -- as of about 20 local offices with a venture business in the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","that was running down its portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The total 3i portfolio had approximately GBP 3 billion of value, and there was little debt in the portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The portfolio yielded about 7%, comfortably paying for the cost of the business and an attractive dividend to shareholders.",1087
18511,"2012m5","There are about 3,400 individual investments, and they averaged around GBP 1 million in size.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Generally, the investments were passive in nature, with relatively few buyouts.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And by the way, the stock market was as tricky then as it is today.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Today, the group could not be more different.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have offices all over the world and only one investment office in the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have approximately 100 core investments, and we control nearly half of them by value together with our external managed funds.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I say control, because we tend to have a majority of the equity, but it sits on top of quite a lot of leverage.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We now have 3 strong capabilities, Private Equity, Infrastructure investing and Debt Management.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The group manages more of its own funds today as well as core third-party funds.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But in general, the investments after interest costs provide a much lower cash yield than they did in 1994.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'm looking at the challenging world today.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We are much better placed to prosper from our 3 capabilities in mid-market Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management than we would have been if we'd remained a U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Private Equity business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The international network gives us true competitive advantage in important geographies like Northern Europe and India as well as the group's traditional base in the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think it's fair to say that we currently have an imbalance between our costs and our income.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's also fair to say that we have a difficult legacy portfolio from the peak years of 2007 to 2009.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But these are issues we can deal with in the coming years, and in doing that, we can create a 3i which will be more focused and a lot leaner.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We should then be capable of producing strong cash returns for our shareholders and our limited partners by using our deep sector expertise and a more focused international footprint.",1087
18511,"2012m5","After Michael approached me last year, I agreed to join 3i as CIO in October because I thought it sounded like a fascinating world, and I certainly haven't been disappointed.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The range of people, the range of investments and the sorts of issues we're dealing with have surpassed my expectations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's been both stimulating and challenging right from the first day.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The team at 3i want to get back to the top of their game, and I have little doubt they're up to the challenges ahead.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Now I'd like to give you some of my perspective on the current business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have a direct Private Equity portfolio of some GBP 2.",1087
18511,"2012m5","5 billion spread across these geographies, and I have managed to get round a good number of these offices in the last 6 months.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In the main, I've been very impressed with the teams that I spent time with.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The traffic lights indicate my assessment of the portfolios by geography.",1087

18511,"2012m5","Well, I mean, the good thing about having a Debt Management business is, as we have talked about, is that as the fees come off in -- over a period in terms of the Private Equity business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Jeremy has done a fantastic job in terms of building that business and actually increasing the fee income, and he has a number of growth opportunities that he's looking at that we hope will mean that we continue to see improvement in fees servicing next year, and those fees will come off in terms of the Private Equity business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","[indiscernible] Daniel Garrod from Barclays here.",1087
18511,"2012m5","A couple of quick questions.",1087
18511,"2012m5","You seem to have moved from previously sort of saying a GBP 1 billion target for net debt to now indicating that's a GBP 1 billion target at a gross debt level.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I was wondering if you'd give it more color on how you determine that to be the appropriate figure at a gross debt level.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And why -- what was behind the decision not to roll, particularly your June 12 FRN? Second question, the -- on the sort of capital returns policy, can you give any more color on why would the level of realization shared with shareholders has been determined at the 15% to 20% level? What was the thought process that went into that decision? Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this presentation.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Although this is formally the announcement of our results for the financial year till 31st March 2012, it has been a busy period since the year end, and we would like you -- like to take you through the considerable progress we have made since March, including this morning's announcement of Simon Borrows as 3i's new Chief Executive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The agenda for today's meeting is set out on this slide coming up.",1087
18511,"2012m5","First of all, I will outline to you the strategic mandate that the board has agreed with Simon and describe the process that we undertook that led to his appointment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Julia will then provide an update on the financial performance of the group in the year through 31st March 2012 and discuss portfolio performance, costs and management of the balance sheet.",1087
18511,"2012m5","She will also provide greater detail on the proposed return of capital and the parameters under which these returns will take place.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Julia will hand over to Simon, who will briefly introduce himself and reflect on the impressions he has formed of 3i since joining them late last year before setting out how he intends to implement the strategic mandate given to him by the board.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Now since the year end, I have been consulting widely with our larger shareholders to obtain their views on 4 key areas identified by the board as needing further attention.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'm very grateful to the shareholders for their feedback regarding both the process we have followed in appointing Simon and in setting -- settling the mandate that he and the board have agreed.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So to take each area in turn.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you know, we have been seeking to diversify the business from its core focus on Private Equity, Philip Middleton, building on the successful track record of our Infrastructure business and acquiring a Debt Management business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The aspiration has been to build a diversified asset manager with more stable and visible revenue streams.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have also consulted on the steps we have been taking to implementing the strategy.",1087
18511,"2012m5","First, as regards to the shape and location of our investment teams, we recognize that each of our markets and the geographies in which we work on continually changing.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Activity levels in the European market have not recovered, but the new management in the Private Equity business is making good progress in refocusing that business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Infrastructure is an attractive asset class, and we had made excellent progress in a highly competitive market, and there are attractive consolidation opportunities in Debt Management.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have, however, asked Simon, our new Chief Executive, to determine the best shape and investment strategy for the business going forward in the light of the resources available to us.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Second, costs.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have made a lot of progress in reducing costs under Michael's leadership.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Costs are approximately GBP 110 million lower than 3 years ago, but there is more to do, and Simon will be addressing this alongside determining the right shape for the business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The next area was to review the allocation of capital between return to shareholders and investment opportunities, taking into account the group's balance sheet position and the availability and attractiveness of investment opportunities, both external and in 3i's own shares.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I do not want to preempt Julia's presentation of the conclusions that the board has reached and the parameters that have been set for future returns of capital.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I would like to say, however, that we have listened carefully to the feedback we have received and formulated our proposals with a view to allowing our shareholders to participate directly in the value flowing from realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Finally, there is a communications point that I have discussed with shareholders.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We are a U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","-listed company followed by U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","analysts with a register made up substantially of U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","investors and widely commented on by the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So it's natural that the performance of our U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","assets that includes many household names tends to overshadow the investments we have on the continent, which have been amongst our strongest performers.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So in order to show our investment performance in a proper perspective, we have today implemented a new approach to disclosure in which we are giving more information about the performance of the more significant investments in our portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","That brings me to the appointment of our new Chief Executive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you all know, the board began a process to identify a successor to Michael at the end of March, following the announcement of his intention to step down as Chief Executive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The board had a very clear view of the characteristics it was seeking in our new Chief Executive, and this seemed to match the views of those institutional shareholders we consulted.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It was against this backdrop that the nominations committee began a process in which it considered both internal and external candidates.",1087
18511,"2012m5","A long list of well over a dozen candidates was reduced to a short list of 4, and it is with great pleasure that we have been able to announce today the appointment of Simon of our -- as our new Chief Executive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Many of you will already know Simon, but I should introduce him formally.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Simon has been Chief Investment Officer and a member of the board of 3i since he joined the company in October last year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Prior to joining 3i, he was Chairman of Greenhill & Co.",1087
18511,"2012m5","International LLP, having previously been co-Chief Executive of Greenhill & Co Inc.",1087
18511,"2012m5",", a leading independent investment bank listed on the New York Stock Exchange.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Before founding the European operations of Greenhill in 1998, Simon was the Managing Director of Baring Brothers International Limited.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So Simon already knows the business well, and he has a clear view of the priorities for action.",1087
18511,"2012m5","He'll need some time, of course, to prepare detailed plans for the future, but the board has endeavored to set out, in conjunction with Simon, a set of clear, tangible and credible initiatives with a view to determining 3i's future path.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The next step therefore, is to ensure that we have a stable platform from which to move the business forward.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We'd like to put an end to the recent uncertainty that has affected the firm and to seek a powerful demonstration that the shareholders are willing to give their full support to Simon and to the plans that we are outlining today.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have, therefore, decided to bring our Annual General Meeting forward to the 29th of June.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Thereafter, our priority will be to execute our strategy, to improve performance and to deliver long-term shareholder value.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And I'll now hand over to Julia.",1087
18511,"2012m5","There's one there at the back.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I mean, it's fair to say in terms of calendar Q1 trading data, we've seen some positive indications and performance overall, and you'll see some of the effects of that coming through when we do our quarterly NAV update in July.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I would say, clearly, with stable markets, it would be easy to be more confident about how much of that actually projects forward in terms of the overall look for the portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And we clearly don't have that at the moment, and continued volatility markets will drive multiples as well, but the early indications in that Q1 trading data is reasonably positive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The intention is to maintain the regular dividend, and what we're talking about here is defining the amount of any incremental distribution over and above that regular dividend.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And clearly, we will look to progressions in terms of realizations through the year, and as I've said, it's almost inevitable we'll reduce the gross debt.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It is GBP 1.",1087
18511,"2012m5","6 billion at the start of the year, so GBP 600 million of cash to reduce it to GBP 1 billion.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And so that's why we're saying that we shouldn't anticipate any incremental distribution, certainly not in this calendar year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'm not sure I could give you any more color than I've already mentioned.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I mean, we have to strike a balance in allowing shareholder to participate in returns.",1087
18511,"2012m5","That's very important.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But realizations are the lifeblood of our organization.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's what funds investment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And so we had a look at our strategic plan, looked at our plans for within and that those were the numbers that I think struck the right balance, and that's where we have concluded.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And could you just repeat your second questions? Or.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Well, we can't be too prescriptive about it.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I mean, clearly, we have to balance, and we have to make sure that the cash flows work.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But we have a number of ongoing commitments, so existing funds, our India Infrastructure Fund, our Growth Capital fund.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have some new opportunities in Debt Management, and we have a new team in Brazil who are keen to invest.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So balancing all of those things, we have existing commitments to our Private Equity portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Part of that growth is about further investments into that portfolio as well.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So all of that goes into the mix that we're trying to manage.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Caze.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Julia, just a quick question on fee income.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Obviously, with Eurofund V going on to a residual cost basis, can you say what effect that will have on an ongoing basis on fee income? Thank you, Adrian, and good morning, everybody.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As I take you through the financial results of the group for the year ended 31st of March 2012, there are 3 key areas that I want to focus on: the performance of our portfolio and how it has developed through the year; the progress we have made regarding our operating cost base; and the priority we have given to managing our balance sheet and our ability, as a consequence, to enhance direct returns to shareholders.",1087
18511,"2012m5","A quick summary first of the key financials for the year before moving to the more material aspects in greater detail.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Gross portfolio return of minus 8.",1087
18511,"2012m5","2% on opening portfolio value is driven by lower-than-normal realized profits, valuation write-downs reflecting lower multiples, some underperformance in the portfolio and a net fall in the quoted portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Our model has seen dilution from gross portfolio return to net portfolio return as a result of our net operating costs, and I'll use the next slide to talk through how each of our business lines have performed.",1087
18511,"2012m5","When gross returns are below our target levels, there is no gearing benefit from net debt.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And so the total return of minus 19.",1087
18511,"2012m5","5% reflects the dilution of our net interest cost.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It also reflects the impact in the pension fund valuation, which we settled at the half year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In keeping with the distribution policy we announced in November, the board has confirmed its intention to pay a final dividend of 5.",1087
18511,"2012m5","4p per share subject to shareholder approval, making a total dividend for the year of 8.",1087
18511,"2012m5","1p per share and a cash cost of GBP 75 million.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'll comment on the evolution of our distribution policy later in this presentation.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Our assets under management have reduced in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Clearly, realizations contribute to this.",1087
18511,"2012m5","However, the more material factor is the effect of the end of Eurofund V's investment period when we switched from including the total commitment to the amount invested, and this is offset somewhat by new funds in Debt Management.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Finally, we remain selective with new investment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And I'm pleased to say that the investments we've made in recent vintages are showing good performance overall, and realizations of GBP 771 million provide real evidence of the strength of our portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The money multiple on the 10 most material transactions averaged 2.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As I set out in the half year, we've enhanced our disclosure to include net portfolio return by business line.",1087
18511,"2012m5","79% of our balance sheet is invested in the Private Equity portfolio, and so the performance of that business line is dominated by the gross portfolio return.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'll be talking shortly in more detail about the drivers of the GBP 339 million negative return in the year and operating costs more generally.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Our Infrastructure business continues to perform well.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The gross portfolio return of GBP 11 million includes an increase of GBP 22 million in the value of our 34% holding in 3i Infrastructure plc as well as GBP 18 million of dividends received on our stake.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As Cressida Hogg explained in detail when announcing the results of 3iN last week, strong performance in its European investments have been offset by a reduction in the valuation of our investments, which we hold through the Indian Infrastructure Fund.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This is principally due to currency and specifically, the share price performance of Adani Power.",1087
18511,"2012m5","However, the operational performance of the Indian portfolio is broadly in line with expectations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Importantly from the 3i Group perspective, the gross returns from 3iN are enhanced with fee income of GBP 25 million, resulting in a 2.",1087
18511,"2012m5","8% return over opening book value.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Group investments in Infrastructure included GBP 33 million in the exercise of the 3iN's warrants, and it also included GBP 28 million of balance sheet investment in LIN and Nordic electricity and heating distribution network business, which we made alongside 3iN.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Debt Management is our newest business line, and performance since the acquisition of the Mizuho business 12 months ago has been very strong.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The results here reflect the fact that this business line is in development.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So last year's return benefited from the realization of the original debt warehouse.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And when you look at the net portfolio return of the business, it's worth noting that carry on cost lines include GBP 6 million of acquisition accounting adjustments.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Excluding these, the underlying return is GBP 9 million, somewhat better than presented here.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But most significantly, dynamic investment management has meant that fees have accrued more quickly than we had planned, and as a consequence, cash generated by the business has already covered the original acquisition cost.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Jeremy Ghose continues to look at growth opportunities for the business to provide further fee income and return to the group.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Returning then to the 3 most significant elements of our returns in more detail, namely portfolio performance, operating costs and the return of our conservative balance sheet strategy.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I want to take you through the performance of the portfolio as a whole and then how that's reflected in our valuation.",1087
18511,"2012m5","At the highest level and not surprisingly, our portfolio performance reflects the markets and the macro environment in which it operates and the prevailing market conditions that existed when the investments were made.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In the Private Equity portfolio, which accounts for 79% of the total, we have seen strong growth in Northern Europe and the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5",", which is where we have targeted investments made since 2009.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Northern Europe has provided our strongest realizations in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Conversely, we have seen fragility in Spain, the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","and more recently, France, which has impacted performance in the year, and Simon will talk through these aspects in more detail later.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you'd expect, our Infrastructure portfolio has been much less impacted by European macro issues, and the portfolio continues to perform well.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As a result, materially all of the reduction in portfolio value is attributable to the Private Equity business, and within that, 2/3 relates to the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5",", Spanish and French asset.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Encouragingly, while we have taken the opportunity to realize investments, we have achieved a good money multiple, 2.",1087
18511,"2012m5","9x over the largest 10 sales, 7 of which were based in Northern Europe.",1087
18511,"2012m5","To give you some quantification then of overall performance, we have seen earnings growth in the portfolio of 9% in the 12 months, December 2011 on a value-weighted basis, and you can see here how that's spread across the portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","By value, 80% of the portfolio grew its earning and 42% by more than 10% in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The last 2 vintages have performed better than average, with value-weighted earnings growth of 20% in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Now it's clear from discussions with shareholders and analysts that there is a strong desire for greater deal -- detail on the performance of individual portfolio companies and as a whole.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have to balance this appetite with our confidentiality obligations to the private companies in which we invest and take account of disclosure restrictions imposed on minority investment positions.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So we're therefore providing some new disclosure in the appendix of this presentation at an individual company level for the top 25 assets but on an anonymous basis.",1087
18511,"2012m5","These assets account for 66% of total portfolio value.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have provided you revenue data to give a sense of scale and earnings growth data to demonstrate momentum.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'm sure you'll want to look at this data in detail, but it shows, for example, that of that 25, 20 grew earnings in the year and 9 by more than 10%.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So let me now turn to how that performance is reflected in the valuations at the 31st of March.",1087
18511,"2012m5","At the 31st of March, the earnings used in our valuations typically are based on the management's accounts of companies till the 31st of December.",1087
18511,"2012m5","However, where we expect future earnings to be lower than those in December -- the December 2011 management accounts, we use the forecast earnings.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have used forecast earnings for only 8% of companies in the portfolio at March.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This is an improvement in the position at 30th of September, when 23% of companies were valued on this basis and at 31st of March 2011, when the number was 12%.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Of course, multiples are the other significant driver of valuations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The weighted average EBITDA multiple was 7% lower in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Although the market was volatile in the year, equivalent sectors and geographies follow the net basis by about the same amount.",1087
18511,"2012m5","However, in a number of cases, particularly in geographies with more challenging economic conditions, we have also reduced the multiple to a greater degree than the comparable set.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And as a result, the weighted average EBITDA multiple for the portfolio valued on an earnings basis was 8.",1087
18511,"2012m5","2x pre-discount and 7.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So the effect of that underlying earnings and multiple movement can be seen here in the earnings multiples and impairment lines.",1087
18511,"2012m5","To be clear, impairments are simply the impact of earnings-based valuation on the debt elements in our capitals structures.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Other factors to note include provisions of GBP 138 million, which relates to 6 companies across a range of geographies and sectors.",1087
18511,"2012m5","2 of the 6 are in Spain, with 1 significant provision of GBP 83 million relating to Hess, a renewable power service provider.",1087
18511,"2012m5","About half of this write-down on Hess had been recognized at the half year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The value of the quarter portfolio fell by GBP 20 million in total but includes the increase of 3iN of GBP 22 million, offset by reductions in our investments in Adani Power, which is part of the Indian infrastructure portfolio and GAIN Capital, a U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","growth capital investment which floated last year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The most significant item in the industry metric category relates to our investment in ACR, the Singaporean-based Asian reinsurance business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This is heavily impacted by the Thai floods at the end of calendar 2011, and this led to a value movement of GBP 29 million.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Finally, it's worth noting that spread across the categories is GBP 47 million of value movement relating to dividends from the portfolio, and these include the elsewhere and returns as income.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Looking then to the effect that these unrealized value movements have had on the balance sheet value.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We started the year with the portfolio value of GBP 4 billion, new investments of GBP 374 million in the year in 9 companies, further investment of GBP 109 million in the existing portfolio, and capitalized interest increased the portfolio by GBP 646 million.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The value of assets sold was GBP 748 million, and the unrealized value movement that I've just been talking about, which is the portfolio by GBP 498 million.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And as you know, we partially hedge currency movements, and a weakening of the euro and rupee in particular in the year gave rise to a net FX loss of GBP 49 million in our total return.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The gross impact in the portfolio is a GBP 101 million movement that you can see here.",1087
18511,"2012m5","At the end of the year, we had a portfolio of GBP 3.",1087
18511,"2012m5","2 billion, 79% of which relates to the Private Equity portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Of that Private Equity portfolio, both vintage and the proportion of the portfolio relating to investments made after 2009 has now increased from 10% to 28%.",1087
18511,"2012m5","69% is focused on Northern Europe, U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","and Asia, where the macro environment is more positive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And within Southern Europe, the proportion of the Private Equity portfolio in Spain is now only 7%, down from 11% last year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","At our half year announcement in November, we detailed each business lines' net portfolio return for the first time, allowing visibility across our key business measure.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We announced in March that to provide more transparency regarding the performance of the business, particularly against the volatile market backdrop, we will provide -- be providing a quarterly NAV update, which will start in July for the quarter ending the 30th of June.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And today, we have included in our presentation and press release further new disclosure that seeks to provide more comprehensive detail and information about our key portfolio companies.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In addition to that, as I've already talked about, we are also providing additional commentary regarding our top 10 assets, which account for 43% of the portfolio, to make clear our investment strategy and view on current performance, further information regarding earnings growth, net debt levels and refinancing across the portfolio and the multiple of original cost achieved on our largest 10 assets in the period.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We believe that this increased level of disclosure will allow shareholders to be more -- be able to more clearly track and understand our progress.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The second area I wanted to focus on today was cost.",1087
18511,"2012m5","There's been considerable commentary about the operating cost base in recent months, and so I wanted to give you some more detail on costs, what has been achieved to date in reducing them and what is planned in the next 12 months.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you can see from this chart, we have made significant progress in reducing our cost base.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The peak run rate during the year ended the 31st of March 2008 was GBP 290 million with 788 people.",1087
18511,"2012m5","By the 31st of March 2012, operating costs are 38% lower and GBP 180 million, and headcount has reduced to 435.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And this reduction is despite the addition of 30 people in the Debt Management business and 8 people in Brazil.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In November 2011, we announced the changes to our Private Equity team and indicated that we expected, as a result, to reduce costs by at least GBP 50 million.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Since completing those changes and taking account the consequent changes to support services and property requirements, we expect the annualized benefit of these measures to be GBP 25 million in 2012.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Finally, the third area I said I would focus on today was the effect of the conservative balance sheet management strategy on our total return.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Following the rights issue in 2009, we set some parameters within which to manage liquidity, net debt and gross debt and thus, manage gearing.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have held high levels of liquidity throughout this period of economic uncertainty, which has not recovered in any sustained way since 2009.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The liquidity is set to ensure that we're able to meet our fund commitments, debt and pension obligations and meet the running cost of the business for 2 years, assuming that there are no realizations and that refinancing is unavailable.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This is conservative, but there have been several occasions in the last 2 years when refinancing markets have shut.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And in the last 6 months, we have had times when realization has appeared to have slowed dramatically.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But this conservatism does have a cost.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Gross interest payable was GBP 103 million in the year ended 31st of March 2012.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So to address this, we have been reducing the amount of gross debt and extending its maturity.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you can see from this chart, gross debt has reduced from its peak of GBP 2.",1087
18511,"2012m5","6 billion in 2009 to GBP 1.",1087
18511,"2012m5","6 billion at the 31st of March 2012, a 21% reduction in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have decided not to refinance the outstanding maturity of our FRN, which matures in June.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As a consequence of that and other scheduled repayments, expect gross debt to fall by at least another 20% to GBP 1.",1087
18511,"2012m5","3 million at the 30th of September.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And because the finance that matures in the next 6 months is some of our cheaper financing, interest will not fall by the same level as gross debt.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But all other things being equal, I expect it to be of the order of GBP 90 million in this year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And of that GBP 90 million, GBP 52 million relates to our long-dated debt repayable in 2017, 2023 and 2032.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Now, it's the board's intention that we continue this trajectory with a target of reducing gross debt to less than GBP 1 billion by June 2013, and thereafter, we will set it as a limit.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This continued focus also means that the level of gearing at 18% at 31st of March remains within our expected range of north of 30%.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So the significant progress we've made in reducing our debt and maintaining our conservative balance sheet approach through volatile financing and M&A markets has provided the flexibility for the board to make further progress in defining how its intent to allocate its capital and provide returns to shareholders.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We announced the re-basing of the dividend in November and consistent with that, have today confirmed the final dividend of 5.",1087
18511,"2012m5","4p per share, a total dividend payout of 8.",1087
18511,"2012m5","1p per share subject to shareholder approval.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This was an important step in determining the appropriate allocation of capital between returns to shareholders and our investment opportunities.",1087
18511,"2012m5","At the time of making that distribution, we were not specific about defining the basis of distribution.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Today, we set out the parameters, which will define our future distribution policy, strengthening it in order to give shareholders a direct share in the success of the group's realization activities.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Providing gearing remains less than 20%.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The board therefore intends to distribute to shareholders further amounts such as the total distribution in the year, including the regular dividend, represents between 15% and 20% of gross cash realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The method of distribution will depend on a number of factors, including the size of the distribution and the share price but may include a special dividend, use of the standing share buyback authority or other capital distribution methods.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In the next 12 months, our priority will be the reduction of gross debt, and we expect to implement this new policy progressively in the light of the performance of the business, progress in implementing the Chief Executive's strategic mandate and the strength of the group's cash flow.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So we currently expect realizations for this year to be lower than the GBP 771 million that we received last year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I do not expect any additional distribution will be made in this calendar year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The board firmly believes that this policy provides a comprehensive and flexible means of ensuring that shareholders participate directly in the returns of the group, and we will update shareholders on progress that we're making towards a new distribution policy as well as reducing gross debt on a half yearly basis.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So to summarize, the portfolio performance reflects a period of market and political volatility, but there is evidence of good performance in the more recent vintages.",1087
18511,"2012m5","However, stability in the Eurozone with all its implications will be critical for sustained improvement.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have continued our focus on operating efficiency with tangible results evident in reduced operating costs and expectation of further reduction next year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Our conservative balance sheet strategy has provided strength in fragile markets, but we have taken further steps to reduce its dilutive effect on returns.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And as a result of progress in managing the balance sheet, we have today announced measures to enhance our distribution policy, giving shareholders direct participation in our cash realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So thank you, and I'll now hand over to Simon.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's Bruce Hamilton, Morgan Stanley.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Just to get on the reduction in the gross debt of GBP 600 million, should we read it that basically, that would just be paid out of gross cash? Or do you expect that sort of net realizations will play into that? Or are you saying then that actually you'll be molding a lot of investment in the hopes you'll bring the gross debt down? That wasn't entirely clear to me, the components of how you pay that GBP 600 million back.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think it was probably just one question, but the question is really whether the 80% retention ratio or reinvestment ratio would be the same.",1087
18511,"2012m5","What -- would it vary at all according to whether the shares were trading on the current 30%-plus discount or whether they were trading closer to NAV? In other words, do you view it as sustainable for you to be reinvesting 80% if in 3 years' time, the shares were still trading at their current rating with the implied, I suppose -- I mean, we don't know what the market environment is going to be, but with the implied lack of confidence, which is inherent in that rating? Yes, that's fine.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I mean, as I said in my presentation, the gross debt costs GBP 100 million a year at the moment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And it's imperative that we reduce that cost and improve the cash flow generation, the ongoing cash flow generation for the group, particularly when we want to increase our distribution policy.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So we looked at our gross debt profile.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We looked at how to bring that down.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I mean, it's fair to say that getting to the GBP 1 billion is, to an extent, inevitable.",1087
18511,"2012m5","If you look at the profile of our maturities, we will get to that in June, and the GBP 1 billion roughly equates to our longer-term debt.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So when the maturities have run through this year, we will be left with a bit of long-term debt, which at the moment is costing just over GBP 50 million a year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think that that was the real focus.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In terms of giving prioritization to that gross debt, the board was clearly concerned to make sure that as we went into a higher distribution policy that we had -- made sure that we still had a financially secure balance sheet for the ongoing importance of the business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think in terms of setting the 15% to 20% range, I mean, we ran various scenarios.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And what we wanted to be able to do was make sure that we were showing clear intention for our shareholders to be able to participate in the success of the group, which was most visible when it comes to realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So that was the link to realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In terms of setting a level, we obviously have a view to the ongoing growth of the business and the ongoing investment opportunities of the business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So what we're trying to strike is a balance in terms of allowing shareholders to participate directly in returns but also to be able to continue to invest in and grow the business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's important to note that the numbers that we give you, so the 9% overall growth, is a value-weighted number.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So you'll understand that including a value-weighted number, we don't include the effect of earnings, which are for companies which have a low or a 0 value.",1087
18511,"2012m5","They don't have much effect.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So the aggregate earnings growth for those companies that are valued on an earnings basis is actually 2%, which instinctively correlates back to that GBP 23 million number that you have in your return.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And then in regards of -- I mean, if you're expecting that clearly, in the market environment, realizations will be down year-over-year, would you be roughly managing investments to a similar rate as realizations? Or is that the wrong way to think about things? Are there any more questions? If not, I think we can bring this presentation to a close.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Just thank you all very much indeed for your attendance.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Thank you so much.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Julia, could you just give us a bit more color on the earnings growth figure.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think over the year, that added GBP 23 million to the return.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But as you're showing in the earlier slides, I think 80% portfolio of the Private Equity portfolio actually saw earnings growth.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So this actually seems to be a relatively low return given that background.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Thank you very much, Simon.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you can see, Simon knows -- has known 3i a long time and knows the business very well.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's an important day for 3i.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have a new Chief Executive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have announced a clear and concrete set of measures to take 3i forward,and we're delighted to take any of your questions.",1087
18511,"2012m5","[Operator Instructions] I think in view of Simon's opening remarks, if Iain and Philip wanted to go first, that would be only just appropriate.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Who would like to start? It looks as though you have it, Iain.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Well, I mean, the good thing about having a Debt Management business is, as we've talked about, is that as the fees come off in -- over a period in terms of the Private Equity business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Jeremy has done a fantastic job in terms of building that business and actually increasing the fee income, and he has a number of growth opportunities that he's looking at that we hope will mean that we continue to see improvement in fees servicing next year, and those fees will come off in terms of the Private Equity business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Caze.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Julia, just a quick question on fee income.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Obviously, with Eurofund V going on to a residual cost basis, can you say what effect that will have on an ongoing basis on fee income? It's Andrew Bell from Witan Investment Trust.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'd just be interested to hear a little bit of color on how you decided upon a 15% or 20% distribution ratio, or to put another way, an intention to retain 80% or 85% and whether that's at all contingent on where the shares are trading in relation to the net asset value.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The intention is to maintain the regular dividend, and what we're talking about here is defining the amount of any incremental distribution over and above that regular dividend.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And clearly, we will look to progression in terms of realizations through the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And all that said, it's almost inevitable we'll reduce the gross debt.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It is GBP 1.",1087
18511,"2012m5","6 billion at the start of the year, so GBP 600 million of cash to reduce it to GBP 1 billion.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And so that's why we're saying that we shouldn't anticipate any incremental distribution, certainly not in this calendar year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","There's one there at the back.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Well, we actually have to manage all of those components on a dynamic basis.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So I mean, I have a budget that anticipates the level of realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I have a budget that anticipates the level of investment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We said that we're going to be selective about new investments, and that continues, so we will see.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have cash on our balance sheet at the moment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We've finished the year with liquidity of GBP 1.",1087
18511,"2012m5","7 billion, so we'll be using all of those moving parts that'll determine exactly where we end up.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'll follow up with one more.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The -- you did comment on, in calendar 2012, the additional returns were unlikely because of the gross debt paydown.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But certainly, the intention still, despite whatever the gearing level might be, to pay that ordinary dividend level.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Is that correct? Philip? I wonder can you say a little bit about what your companies are actually telling you now, because as you say it's a very difficult and changeable economic environment, and a lot of your commentary relates to the end of December.",1087
18511,"2012m5","What have you seen since then? And what actually have you seen since we're now talking about the Greek exit again? Thank you, Adrian, and good morning, everybody.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As I take you through the financial results of the group for the year ended 31st of March 2012, there are 3 key areas that I want to focus on: the performance of our portfolio and how it has developed through the year; the progress we have made regarding our operating cost base; and the priority we have given to managing our balance sheet and our ability, as a consequence, to enhance direct returns to shareholders.",1087
18511,"2012m5","A quick summary first of the key financials for the year before moving to the more material aspects in greater detail.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Gross portfolio return of minus 8.",1087
18511,"2012m5","2% on opening portfolio value is driven by lower-than-normal realized profits, valuation write-downs reflecting lower multiples, some underperformance in the portfolio and a net fall in the quoted portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Our model has seen dilution from gross portfolio return to net portfolio return as a result of our net operating costs, and I'll use the next slide to talk through how each of our business lines have performed.",1087
18511,"2012m5","When gross returns are below our target levels, there is no gearing benefit from net debt.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And so the total return of minus 19.",1087
18511,"2012m5","5% reflects the dilution of our net interest cost.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It also reflects the impact in the pension fund valuation, which we settled at the half year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In keeping with the distribution policy we announced in November, the board has confirmed its intention to pay a final dividend of 5.",1087
18511,"2012m5","4p per share subject to shareholder approval, making a total dividend for the year of 8.",1087
18511,"2012m5","1p per share and a cash cost of GBP 75 million.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'll come onto the evolution of our distribution policy later in this presentation.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Our assets under management have reduced in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Clearly, realizations contribute to this.",1087
18511,"2012m5","However, the more material factor is the effect of the end of Eurofund V investment period when we switched from including the total commitment to the amount invested, and this is offset somewhat by new funds in Debt Management.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Finally, we remain selective with new investment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And I'm pleased to say that the investments we've made in recent vintages are showing good performance overall, and realizations of GBP 771 million provide real evidence of the strength of our portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The money multiple on the 10 most material transactions averaged 2.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As I set out in the half year, we've enhanced our disclosure to include net portfolio return by business line.",1087
18511,"2012m5","79% of our balance sheet is invested in the Private Equity portfolio, and so the performance of that business line is dominated by the gross portfolio return.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'll be talking shortly in more detail about the drivers of the GBP 339 million negative return in the year and operating costs more generally.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Our Infrastructure business continues to perform well.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The gross portfolio return of GBP 11 million includes an increase of GBP 22 million in the value of our 34% holding in 3i Infrastructure plc as well as GBP 18 million of dividends received on our stake.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As Cressida Hogg explained in detail when announcing the results of 3iN last week, strong performance in its European investments have been offset by a reduction in the valuation of our investments, which we hold through the Indian Infrastructure Fund.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This is principally due to currency and specifically, the share price performance of Adani Power.",1087
18511,"2012m5","However, the operational performance of the Indian portfolio is broadly in line with expectations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Importantly from the 3i Group perspective, the gross returns from 3iN are enhanced with fee income of GBP 25 million, resulting in a 2.",1087
18511,"2012m5","8% return over opening book value.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Group investments in Infrastructure included GBP 33 million in the exercise of the 3iN's warrants, and it also included GBP 28 million of balance sheet investment in LIN and Nordic electricity and heating distribution network business, which we made alongside 3iN.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Debt Management is our newest business line, and performance since the acquisition of the Mizuho business 12 months ago has been very strong.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The results here reflect the fact that this business line is in development.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So last year's return benefited from the realization of the original debt warehouse.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And when you look at the net portfolio return of the business, it's worth noting that carry on cost lines include GBP 6 million of acquisition accounting adjustments.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Excluding these, the underlying return is GBP 9 million, somewhat better than presented here.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But most significantly, dynamic investment management has meant that fees have accrued more quickly than we had planned, and as a consequence, cash generated by the business has already covered the original acquisition cost.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Jeremy Ghose continues to look at growth opportunities for the business to provide further fee income and return to the group.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Returning then to the 3 most significant elements of our returns in more detail, namely portfolio performance, operating costs and the return of our conservative balance sheet strategy.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I want to take you through the performance of the portfolio as a whole and then how that's reflected in our valuation.",1087
18511,"2012m5","At the highest level and not surprisingly, our portfolio performance reflects the markets and the macro environment in which it operates and the prevailing market conditions that existed when the investments were made.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In the Private Equity portfolio, which accounts for 79% of the total, we have seen strong growth in Northern Europe and the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5",", which is where we have targeted investments made since 2009.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Northern Europe has provided our strongest realizations in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Conversely, we have seen fragility in Spain, the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","and more recently, France, which has impacted performance in the year, and Simon will talk through these aspects in more detail later.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you'd expect, our Infrastructure portfolio has been much less impacted by European macro issues, and the portfolio continues to perform well.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As a result, materially all of the reduction in portfolio value is attributable to the Private Equity business, and within that, 2/3 relates to the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5",", Spanish and French assets.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Encouragingly, while we have taken the opportunity to realize investments, we have achieved a good money multiple, 2.",1087
18511,"2012m5","9x on the largest 10 sales, 7 of which were based in Northern Europe.",1087
18511,"2012m5","To give you some quantification then of overall performance, we've seen earnings growth in the portfolio of 9% in the 12 months to December 2011 on a value-weighted basis, and you can see here how that's spread across the portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","By value, 80% of the portfolio grew its earning and 42% by more than 10% in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The last 2 vintages have performed better than average, with value-weighted earnings growth of 20% in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Now it's clear from discussions with shareholders and analysts that there is a strong desire for greater deal -- detail on the performance of individual portfolio companies and as a whole.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have to balance this appetite with our confidentiality obligations to the private companies in which we invest and take account of disclosure restrictions imposed on minority investment positions.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So we're therefore providing some new disclosure in the appendix of this presentation at an individual company level for the top 25 assets but on an anonymous basis.",1087
18511,"2012m5","These assets account for 66% of total portfolio value.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have provided you revenue data to give a sense of scale and earnings growth data to demonstrate momentum.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'm sure you'll want to look at this data in detail, but it shows, for example, that of that 25, 20 grew earnings in the year and 9 by more than 10%.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So let me now turn to how that performance is reflected in the valuations at the 31st of March.",1087
18511,"2012m5","At the 31st of March, the earnings used in our valuations typically are based on the management's accounts of companies to the 31st of December.",1087
18511,"2012m5","However, where we expect future earnings to be lower than those in December -- the December 2011 management accounts, we use the forecast earnings.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have used forecast earnings for only 8% of companies in the portfolio at March.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This is an improvement in the position at 30th of September, when 23% of companies were valued on this basis and at 31st of March 2011, when the number was 12%.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Of course, multiples are the other significant driver of valuations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The weighted average EBITDA multiple was 7% lower in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Although the market was volatile in the year, equivalent sectors and geographies follow the net basis by about the same amount.",1087
18511,"2012m5","However, in a number of cases, particularly in geographies with more challenging economic conditions, we have also reduced the multiple to a greater degree than the comparable set.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And as a result, the weighted average EBITDA multiple for the portfolio valued on an earnings basis was 8.",1087
18511,"2012m5","2x pre-discount and 7.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So the effect of that underlying earnings and multiple movement can be seen here in the earnings, multiples and impairment lines.",1087
18511,"2012m5","To be clear, impairments are simply the impact of earnings-based valuation on the debt elements in our capitals structures.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Other factors to note include provisions of GBP 138 million, which relate to 6 companies across a range of geographies and sectors.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Two of the 6 are in Spain, with 1 significant provision of GBP 83 million relating to Hess, a renewable power service provider.",1087
18511,"2012m5","About half of this write-down on Hess had been recognized at the half year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The value of the quoted portfolio fell by GBP 20 million in total but includes the increase of 3iN of GBP 22 million, offset by reductions in our investment in Adani Power, which is part of the Indian infrastructure portfolio and GAIN Capital, a U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","growth capital investment which floated last year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The most significant item in the industry metric category relates to our investment in ACR, the Singaporean-based Asian reinsurance business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This is heavily impacted by the Thai floods at the end of calendar 2011, and this led to a value movement of GBP 29 million.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Finally, it's worth noting that spread across the categories is GBP 47 million of value movement relating to dividends from the portfolio, and those are included elsewhere in returns as income.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Looking then to the effect that these unrealized value movements have had on the balance sheet value.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We started the year with the portfolio value of GBP 4 billion.",1087
18511,"2012m5","New investments of GBP 374 million in the year in 9 companies, further investment of GBP 109 million in the existing portfolio, and capitalized interest increased the portfolio by GBP 646 million.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The value of assets sold was GBP 748 million, and the unrealized value movement that I've just been talking about, reduced the portfolio by GBP 498 million.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And as you know, we partially hedge currency movements, and a weakening of the euro and rupee in particular in the year gave rise to a net FX loss of GBP 49 million in our total return.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The gross impact in the portfolio is a GBP 101 million movement that you can see here.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So at the end of the year, we had a portfolio of GBP 3.",1087
18511,"2012m5","2 billion, 79% of which relates to the Private Equity portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Of that Private Equity portfolio, by vintage, the proportion of the portfolio relating to investments made after 2009 has now increased from 10% to 28%.",1087
18511,"2012m5","69% is focused on Northern Europe, U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","and Asia, where the macro environment is more positive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And within Southern Europe, the proportion of the Private Equity portfolio in Spain is now only 7%, down from 11% last year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","At our half year announcement in November, we detailed each business line's net portfolio return for the first time, allowing visibility across our key business measure.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We announced in March that to provide more transparency regarding the performance of the business, particularly against the volatile market backdrop, we will provide -- be providing a quarterly NAV update, which will start in July for the quarter ending the 30th of June.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And today, we have included in our presentation and press release further new disclosure that seeks to provide more comprehensive detail and information about our key portfolio companies.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In addition to that, as I've already talked about, we are also providing additional commentary regarding our top 10 assets, which account for 43% of the portfolio, to make clear our investment strategy and view on current performance, further information regarding earnings growth, net debt levels and refinancing across the portfolio and the multiple of original cost achieved on our largest 10 assets in the period.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We believe that this increased level of disclosure will allow shareholders to be more -- be able to more clearly track and understand our progress.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The second area I wanted to focus on today was cost.",1087
18511,"2012m5","There's been considerable commentary about the operating cost base in recent months, and so I wanted to give you some more detail on costs, what has been achieved to date in reducing them and what is planned in the next 12 months.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you can see from this chart, we have made significant progress in reducing our cost base.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The peak run rate during the year ended the 31st of March 2008 was GBP 290 million with 788 people.",1087
18511,"2012m5","By the 31st of March 2012, operating costs are 38% lower at GBP 180 million, and headcount has reduced to 435.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And this reduction is despite the addition of 30 people in the Debt Management business and 8 people in Brazil.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In November 2011, we announced the changes to our Private Equity team and indicated that we expected, as a result, to reduce costs by at least GBP 50 million.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Since completing those changes and taking account the consequent changes to support services and property requirements, we expect the annualized benefit of these measures to be GBP 25 million in 2012.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Finally, the third area I said I'd focus on today was the effect of the conservative balance sheet management strategy on our total return.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Following the rights issue in 2009, we set some parameters within which to manage liquidity, net debt and gross debt and thus, to manage gearing.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have held high levels of liquidity throughout this period of economic uncertainty, which has not recovered in any sustained way since 2009.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The liquidity is set to ensure that we're able to meet our fund commitments, debt and pension obligations and meet the running cost of the business for 2 years, assuming that there are no realizations and that refinancing is unavailable.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This is conservative, but there have been several occasions in the last 2 years when refinancing markets have shut.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And in the last 6 months, we have had times when realizations appeared to have slowed dramatically.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But this conservatism does have a cost.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Gross interest payable was GBP 103 million in the year ended 31st of March 2012.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So to address this, we have been reducing the amount of gross debt and extending its maturity.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you can see from this chart, gross debt has reduced from its peak of GBP 2.",1087
18511,"2012m5","6 billion in 2009 to GBP 1.",1087
18511,"2012m5","6 billion at the 31st of March 2012, a 21% reduction in the year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have decided not to refinance the outstanding maturity of our FRN, which matures in June.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As a consequence of that and other scheduled repayments, expect gross debt to fall by at least another 20% to GBP 1.",1087
18511,"2012m5","3 million at the 30th of September.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And because the finance that matures in the next 6 months is some of our cheaper financing, interest will not fall by the same level as gross debt.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But all other things being equal, I expect it to be of the order of GBP 90 million in this year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And of that GBP 90 million, GBP 52 million relates to our long-dated debt repayable in 2017, 2023 and 2032.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Now, it's the board's intention that we continue this trajectory with a target of reducing gross debt to less than GBP 1 billion by June 2013, and thereafter, we will set it as a limit.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This continued focus also means that the level of gearing at 18% at 31st of March remains within our expected range of 0% to 30%.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So the significant progress we've made in reducing our debt and maintaining our conservative balance sheet approach through volatile financing and M&A markets has provided the flexibility for the board to make further progress in defining how it intends to allocate its capital and provide returns to shareholders.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We announced the re-basing of the dividend in November and consistent with that, have today confirmed the final dividend of 5.",1087
18511,"2012m5","4p per share, a total dividend payout of 8.",1087
18511,"2012m5","1p per share subject to shareholder approval.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This was an important step in determining the appropriate allocation of capital between returns to shareholders and our investment opportunities.",1087
18511,"2012m5","At the time of making that distribution, we were not specific about defining the basis of distribution.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Today, we set out the parameters, which will define our future distribution policy, strengthening it in order to give shareholders a direct share in the success of the group's realization activities.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Providing gearing remains less than 20%.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The board therefore intends to distribute to shareholders further amounts such that the total distribution in the year, including the regular dividend, represents between 15% and 20% of gross cash realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The method of distribution will depend on a number of factors, including the size of the distribution and the share price but may include a special dividend, use of the standing share buyback authority or other capital distribution methods.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In the next 12 months, our priority will be the reduction of gross debt, and we expect to implement this new policy progressively in the light of the performance of the business, progress in implementing the Chief Executive's strategic mandate and the strength of the group's cash flow.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So we currently expect realizations for this year to be lower than the GBP 771 million that we received last year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I do not expect any additional distribution will be made in this calendar year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The board firmly believes that this policy provides a comprehensive and flexible means of ensuring that shareholders participate directly in the returns of the group, and we will update shareholders on progress that we're making towards a new distribution policy as well as reducing gross debt on a half yearly basis.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So to summarize, the portfolio performance reflects a period of market and political volatility, but there is evidence of good performance in the more recent vintages.",1087
18511,"2012m5","However, stability in the Eurozone with all its implications will be critical for sustained improvement.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have continued our focus on operating efficiency with tangible results evident in reduced operating costs and expectation of further reduction next year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Our conservative balance sheet strategy has provided strength in fragile markets, but we have taken further steps to reduce its dilutive effect on returns.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And as a result of progress in managing the balance sheet, we have today announced measures to enhance our distribution policy, giving shareholders direct participation in our cash realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So thank you, and I'll now hand over to Simon.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Julia, could you just give us a bit more color on the earnings growth figure.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think over the year, that added GBP 23 million to the return.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But as you were showing in the earlier slides, I think 80% portfolio of the Private Equity portfolio actually saw earnings growth.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So this actually seems to be relatively low return given that background.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Daniel Garrod from Barclays here.",1087
18511,"2012m5","A couple of quick questions.",1087
18511,"2012m5","You seem to have moved from previously sort of saying a GBP 1 billion target for net debt to now indicating that's a GBP 1 billion target at a gross debt level.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I was wondering if you'd give it more color on how you determine that to be the appropriate figure at a gross debt level.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And why -- what was behind the decision not to roll, particularly your June 12 FRN? Second question, the -- on the sort of capital returns policy, can you give any more color on why would the level of realization shared with shareholders has been determined at the 15% to 20% level? What was the thought process that went into that decision? I mean, it's fair to say in terms of calendar Q1 trading data, we've seen some positive indications in performance overall, and you'll see some of the effect of that coming through when we do our quarterly NAV update in July.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I would say, clearly, with stable markets, it would be easy to be more confident about how much of that actually projects forward in terms of the overall look for the portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And we clearly don't have that at the moment, and continued volatility markets will drive multiples as well, but the early indications in that Q1 trading data is reasonably positive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Maybe if I could jump in.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think we've tried to weigh up where we are today against where we might get to tomorrow.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And as I indicated in my discussion, where we are today is that we have an imbalance between our income and our costs, and we have a significant interest build.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So I mean in the short term, we need to focus on those things, and we need to set a reasonable ambition for the distributions to shareholders.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Over time, we can clearly review that, and we can also review the opportunities in the market and where our shares might be trading at that time.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But as of today, we've tried to manage the situation that we see now and how we see it developing, but we are, to a degree, in the hands of the macro as to realizations and the strength of that flow.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So it's a little cautious, but it sets the right balance, I think.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'm not sure I could give you any more color than I've already mentioned.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I mean, we have to strike a balance in allowing shareholder to participate in returns.",1087
18511,"2012m5","That's very important.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But realizations are the lifeblood of our organization.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's what funds investment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And so we had a look at our strategic plan, looked at our plans for within and that those were the numbers that I think struck the right balance, and that's where we have concluded.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And could you just repeat your second questions? Or.",1087
18511,"2012m5","[indiscernible] Thank you very much, Simon.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you can see, Simon knows -- has known 3i a long time and knows the business very well.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's an important day for 3i.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have a new Chief Executive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have announced a clear and concrete set of measures to take 3i forward, and we're delighted to take any of your questions.",1087
18511,"2012m5","[Operator Instructions] I think in view of Simon's opening remarks, if Iain and Philip wanted to go first, that would be only just appropriate.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Who would like to start? It looks as though you have it, Iain.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Well, we can't be too prescriptive about it.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I mean, clearly, we have to balance, and we have to make sure that the cash flows work.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But we have a number of ongoing commitments, so existing funds, our India Infrastructure Fund, our Growth Capital fund.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have some new opportunities in Debt Management, and we have a new team in Brazil who are keen to invest.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So balancing all of those things, we have existing commitments to our Private Equity portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Part of that growth is about further investments into that portfolio as well.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So all of that goes into the mix that we're trying to manage.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's Bruce Hamilton, Morgan Stanley.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Just again on the reduction in the gross debt of GBP 600 million, should we read it that basically, that would just be paid out of gross cash? Or do you expect that sort of net realizations will play into that? Or are you saying then that actually you'll be not doing a lot of investment in the hopes you'll bring the gross debt down? That wasn't entirely clear to me, the components of how you pay that GBP 600 million back.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Good morning, everybody, and welcome to this presentation.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Although this is formally the announcement of our results for the financial year to 31st March 2012, it has been a busy period since the year end, and we would like you -- like to take you through the considerable progress we have made since March, including this morning's announcement of Simon Borrows as 3i's new Chief Executive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The agenda for today's meeting is set out on this slide coming up.",1087
18511,"2012m5","First of all, I will outline to you the strategic mandate that the board has agreed with Simon and describe the process that we undertook that led to his appointment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Julia will then provide an update on the financial performance of the group in the year through 31st March 2012 and discuss portfolio performance, costs and management of the balance sheet.",1087
18511,"2012m5","She will also provide greater detail on the proposed return of capital and the parameters under which these returns will take place.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Julia will hand over to Simon, who will briefly introduce himself and reflect on the impressions he has formed of 3i since joining them late last year before setting out how he intends to implement the strategic mandate given to him by the board.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Now since the year end, I have been consulting widely with our largest shareholders to obtain their views on 4 key areas identified by the board as needing further attention.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And I'm very grateful to the shareholders for their feedback regarding both the process we have followed in appointing Simon and in setting -- settling the mandate that he and the board have agreed.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So to take each area in turn.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you know, we have been seeking to diversify the business from its core focus on Private Equity, building on the successful track record of our Infrastructure business and acquiring a Debt Management business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The aspiration has been to build a diversified asset manager with more stable and visible revenue streams.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have also consulted on the steps we have been taking to implementing the strategy.",1087
18511,"2012m5","First, as regards the shape and location of our investment teams, we recognize that each of our markets and the geographies in which we work are continually changing.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Activity levels in the European market have not recovered, but the new management in the Private Equity business is making good progress in refocusing that business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Infrastructure is an attractive asset class, and we had made excellent progress in a highly competitive market, and there are attractive consolidation opportunities in Debt Management.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have, however, asked Simon, as our new Chief Executive, to determine the best shape and investment strategy for the business going forward in the light of the resources available to us.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Second, costs.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have made a lot of progress in reducing costs under Michael's leadership.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Costs are approximately GBP 110 million lower than 3 years ago, but there is more to do, and Simon will be addressing this alongside determining the right shape for the business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The next area was to review the allocation of capital between return to shareholders and investment opportunities, taking into account the group's balance sheet position and the availability and attractiveness of investment opportunities, both external and in 3i's own shares.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I do not want to preempt Julia's presentation of the conclusions that the board has reached and the parameters that have been set for future returns of capital.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I would like to say, however, that we have listened carefully to the feedback we have received and formulated our proposals with a view to allowing our shareholders to participate directly in the value flowing from realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Finally, there is a communications point that I have discussed with shareholders.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We are a U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","-listed company followed by U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","analysts with a register made up substantially of U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","investors and widely commented on by the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So it's natural that the performance of our U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","assets that includes many household names tends to overshadow the investments we have on the continent, which have been amongst our strongest performers.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So in order to show our investment performance in a proper perspective, we have today implemented a new approach to disclosure in which we are giving more information about the performance of the more significant investments in our portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","That brings me to the appointment of our new Chief Executive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","As you all know, the board began a process to identify a successor to Michael at the end of March, following the announcement of his intention to step down as Chief Executive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The board had a very clear view of the characteristics it was seeking in our new Chief Executive, and this seemed to match the views of those institutional shareholders we consulted.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Now, it was against this backdrop that the nominations committee began a process in which it considered both internal and external candidates.",1087
18511,"2012m5","A long list of well over a dozen candidates was reduced to a short list of 4, and it is with great pleasure that we have been able to announce today the appointment of Simon of our -- as our new Chief Executive.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Many of you will already know Simon, but I should introduce him formally.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Simon has been Chief Investment Officer and a member of the board of 3i since he joined the company in October last year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Prior to joining 3i, he was Chairman of Greenhill & Co.",1087
18511,"2012m5","International LLP, having previously been co-Chief Executive of Greenhill & Co Inc.",1087
18511,"2012m5",", a leading independent investment bank listed on the New York Stock Exchange.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Before founding the European operations of Greenhill in 1998, Simon was the Managing Director of Baring Brothers International Limited.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So Simon already knows the business well, and he has a clear view of the priorities for action.",1087
18511,"2012m5","He'll need some time, of course, to prepare detailed plans for the future, but the board has endeavored to set out, in conjunction with Simon, a set of clear, tangible and credible initiatives with a view to determining 3i's future path.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The next step, therefore, is to ensure that we have a stable platform from which to move the business forward.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We'd like to put an end to the recent uncertainty that has affected the firm and to seek a powerful demonstration that the shareholders are willing to give their full support to Simon and to the plans that we are outlining today.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have, therefore, decided to bring our Annual General Meeting forward to the 29th of June.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Thereafter, our priority will be to execute our strategy, to improve performance and to deliver long-term shareholder value.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And I'll now hand over to Julia.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Are there any more questions? If not, I think we can bring this presentation to a close.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Just thank you all very much indeed for your attendance.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Thank you so much.",1087
18511,"2012m5","[indiscernible] Yes, that's fine.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I mean, as I said in my presentation, the gross debt costs GBP 100 million a year at the moment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And it's imperative that we reduce that cost and improve the cash flow generation, the ongoing cash flow generation for the group, particularly when we want to increase our distribution policy.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So we looked at our gross debt profile.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We looked at how to bring that down.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I mean, it's fair to say that getting to the GBP 1 billion is, to an extent, inevitable.",1087
18511,"2012m5","If you look at the profile of our maturities, we will get to that in June, and the GBP 1 billion roughly equates to our longer-term debt.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So when the maturities have run through this year, we will be left with a bit of long-term debt, which at the moment is costing just over GBP 50 million a year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think that, that was the real focus.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In terms of giving prioritization to that gross debt, the board was clearly concerned to make sure that as we went into a higher distribution policy that we had -- made sure that we still had a financially secure balance sheet for the ongoing importance of the business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think in terms of setting the 15% to 20% range, I mean, we ran various scenarios.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And what we wanted to be able to do was make sure that we were showing clear intention for our shareholders to be able to participate in the success of the group, which is most visible when it comes to realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So that was the link to realizations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In terms of setting a level, we obviously have a view to the ongoing growth of the business and the ongoing investment opportunities of the business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So what we're trying to strike is a balance in terms of allowing shareholders to participate directly in returns but also to be able to continue to invest in and grow the business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's important to note that the numbers that we give you, so the 9% overall growth, is a value-weighted number.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So you'll understand that including a value-weighted number, we don't include the effect of earnings, which are for companies which have a low or a 0 value.",1087
18511,"2012m5","They don't have much effect.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So the aggregate earnings growth for those companies that are valued on an earnings basis is actually 2%, which instinctively correlates back to that GBP 23 million number that you have in your return.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And then maybe to add, so I mean, if you're expecting it clearly, in the market environment, realizations will be down year-over-year, would you be roughly managing investments to a similar rate as realizations? Or is that the wrong way to think about things? I think there was probably just one question, but the question is really whether the 80% retention ratio or reinvestment ratio would be the same.",1087
18511,"2012m5","What -- would it vary at all according to whether the shares were trading on the current 30%-plus discount or whether they were trading closer to NAV? In other words, do you view it as sustainable for you to be reinvesting 80% if in 3 years' time, the shares were still trading at their current rating with the implied, I suppose -- I mean, we don't know what the market environment is going to be, but with the implied lack of confidence, which is inherent in that rating? Thanks, Julia, and good morning, everyone.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The last time I took to a platform to speak for 3i was at the company flotation in 1994, and I'm delighted to see there are 1 or 2 familiar faces here.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We've got Richard Summers, who was on the board at that time; Philip Middleton, who's sitting down there; and Iain Scouller, who were both covering the company at the time.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But 3i was very different in those days.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It was mainly a U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","-based business operating out of about 20 local offices with a venture business in the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","that was running down its portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The total 3i portfolio had approximately GBP 3 billion of value, and there was little debt in the portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The portfolio yielded about 7%, comfortably paying for the cost of the business and an attractive dividend to shareholders.",1087
18511,"2012m5","There were about 3,400 individual investments, and they averaged around GBP 1 million in size.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Generally, the investments were passive in nature, with relatively few buyouts.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And by the way, the stock market was as tricky then as it is today.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Today, the group could not be more different.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have offices all over the world and only one investment office in the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have approximately 100 core investments, and we control nearly half of them by value together with our external managed funds.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I say control, because we tend to have a majority of the equity, but it sits on top of quite a lot of leverage.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We now have 3 strong capabilities, Private Equity, Infrastructure investing and Debt Management.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The group manages more of its own funds today as well as core third-party funds.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But in general, the investments after interest costs provide a much lower cash yield than they did in 1994.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I'm looking at the challenging world today.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We are much better placed to prosper from our 3 capabilities in mid-market Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management than we would have been if we'd remained a U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Private Equity business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The international network gives us true competitive advantage in important geographies like Northern Europe and India as well as the group's traditional base in the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think it's fair to say that we currently have an imbalance between our costs and our income.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's also fair to say that we have a difficult legacy portfolio from the peak years of 2007 to 2009.",1087
18511,"2012m5","But these are issues we can deal with in the coming years, and in doing that, we can create a 3i which will be more focused and a lot leaner.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We should then be capable of producing strong cash returns for our shareholders and our limited partners by using our deep sector expertise and a more focused international footprint.",1087
18511,"2012m5","After Michael approached me last year, I agreed to join 3i as CIO in October because I thought it sounded like a fascinating role, and I certainly haven't been disappointed.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The range of people, the range of investments and the sorts of issues we're dealing with have surpassed my expectations.",1087
18511,"2012m5","It's been both stimulating and challenging right from the first day.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The team at 3i want to get back to the top of their game, and I have little doubt they're up to the challenges ahead.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Now I'd like to give you some of my perspective on the current business.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have a direct Private Equity portfolio of some GBP 2.",1087
18511,"2012m5","5 billion spread across these geographies, and I have managed to get round a good number of these offices in the last 6 months.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In the main, I've been very impressed with the teams that I spent time with.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The traffic lights indicate my assessment of the portfolios by geography.",1087
18511,"2012m5","You can clearly see the problems we have in Southern Europe, and Spain has been particularly tough for us over the last 12 months.",1087
18511,"2012m5","You can also see the strength of our portfolios in Northern Europe as well as a good portfolio in the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We have recruited a first-rate team in Brazil, which looks to be promising from a fundraising point of view as well as an investment point of view.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Another observation I would make is that many of the challenged investments from 2007 to 2009 came out of the U.",1087
18511,"2012m5","and the Spanish offices.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Our well-established teams in Germany, Benelux and France have in the main invested at a steady rate in familiar sectors, and they have far fewer problems in their portfolios.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Now the macro is still very difficult and uncertain, but in these geographies, we have good teams, and we have robust portfolios.",1087
18511,"2012m5","So what about our sector capabilities? If you take a long-term perspective, 3i has generated very good returns from these 4 sectors, and they now dominate the portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In our strong offices, we tend to have up to a dozen professionals with a good blend of operational and financial skills.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Each team will typically be headed by 2 partners.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Let me give you a few examples of our skill sets.",1087
18511,"2012m5","If you're the CIO of 3i and your German team brings you an industrial proposal, you know it will be interesting and well thought through.",1087
18511,"2012m5","You also know that they'll be capable of producing good returns.",1087
18511,"2012m5","The same can be said of consumer in Benelux or France or the testing and inspection unit out of our London team.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And I don't lose much sleep if Cressida and her team turn up with an Infrastructure proposal, which brings me onto Infrastructure.",1087
18511,"2012m5","3i world class at Infrastructure investing.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I don't need to dwell on this portfolio, but I would like us to do more in Infrastructure and continue to bulk up this portfolio.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I like the long-term and cash-generative characteristics of the majority of our investments in this area.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In Debt Management, we continue to grow third-party funds.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Today, total AUM is now approaching GBP 3.",1087
18511,"2012m5","4 billion, and it's scalable from here.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Debt Management makes significant contribution to our operating cash flow.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Jeremy and his team performed impressively last year, and he knows I'm keen he keeps up the momentum this year.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Let me talk about some new investments.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Apart from a good number of quality bolt-on acquisitions for our portfolio companies, I've chaired the investment committee 4 times over the last 6 months looking at new investments, 2 Private Equity investments and 2 Infrastructure investments.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I've also turned away a number of other proposals, because we try to be highly selective in this very tricky environment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","This short list illustrates pretty well 3i's sectors capabilities and international reach, which is so important in these challenging times.",1087
18511,"2012m5","In Private Equity we've invested in GEKA, a German manufacturer which is the world technological leader in mascara brushes.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And we've backed a roll-up cable TV operator in Brazil called Blue Interactive Group.",1087
18511,"2012m5","And in Infrastructure, we've invested in the second-largest electricity distribution network in Finland and new Indian toll road concessions.",1087
18511,"2012m5","There are very few of our competitors who could have produced 4 such varied and attractive investment opportunities in this environment.",1087
18511,"2012m5","My last 2 slides give you an idea about our priorities around asset management and around our investment processes as well as I -- as well as where I will be focusing initially as CEO.",1087
18511,"2012m5","You can see from Slide 32 where we have concentrated over recent months.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Slide 33 shows our focus going forward.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Our costs and our balance sheet will be critical areas for us.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Everybody at 3i gets that we have to demonstrate our investing and asset management skills to shareholders and to LPs.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We are confident that our recent portfolio of investments will do just that.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We are also confident that our shareholders and LPs will enjoy strong cash-on-cash returns, and these -- as these investments mature and are realized.",1087
18511,"2012m5","Thank you for your time.",1087
18511,"2012m5","We'd be happy to take questions.",1087
18511,"2012m5","I think you should direct the difficult ones at Julia and the Chairman, but I'll take the easy ones.",1087
18511,"2012m6","As a follow-up, in terms of the returns on your fund, clearly, that's disappointing thus far.",572
18511,"2012m6","I mean, how long do you think it will take to recover the relationships of the OPs to realistically think about launching the fund? I mean, and what sort of -- what are the steps towards? Is it getting to 1.",572
18511,"2012m6","5x? I mean, how should we think about that process? Yes.",572
18511,"2012m6","I had got a lot of experience of this, again, at Greenhill because one of the initiatives we took before I left was to build up a third-party fundraising team.",572
18511,"2012m6","And we took the old Private Equity team out of Lehman Brothers and we took the property team out of Credit Suisse, and that became the nucleus of our third-party fund business.",572
18511,"2012m6","And looking at what's effective in terms of that activity is you need some geographic people covering key accounts in key locations whether they're across North America, Europe, the Middle East or the Far East.",572
18511,"2012m6","And we really are quite spot in that regard in terms of our -- we have some very deep relationships with LPs but we don't have some broad ones.",572
18511,"2012m6","And we need a proper structure around that whole fundraising activity, which gives us some proper geographic coverage and some functional support in terms of our different product basis be it the Infrastructure, Debt or Private Equity.",572
18511,"2012m6","So we'll be resourcing up the fund-raising capability in the group.",572
18511,"2012m6","It's a number of things.",572
18511,"2012m6","In my prior job, we interviewed many teams in Brazil to open a green hill office.",572
18511,"2012m6","And having met our Brazilian team, I think we have got one of the best teams operating in that market.",572
18511,"2012m6","So whoever, Michael, I guess, did a very good job.",572
18511,"2012m6","So as an individual team, relative competence in all of that, that very high, high order.",572
18511,"2012m6","If you look at the WIPP, our work-in-progress pipeline, it's very strong in that market.",572
18511,"2012m6","And also, we're able to source thing outside of auctions so we're satisfied we're not paying very prices for the things we've been doing as with the case with Blue Interactive.",572
18511,"2012m6","And the third thing is our limited partners have expressed interest in the Brazil, so that's a serious agenda item in due course because people are very interested in that economy.",572
18511,"2012m6","And so we think we can raise a very discrete mid-market Private Equity fund for that Brazilian team.",572
18511,"2012m6","I'd rather not say anything on that at the moment.",572
18511,"2012m6","We are in the process of developing a model for the business.",572
18511,"2012m6","And we did signal on that chart, the master chart, at a point in time, we're going to give you some KPIs in which we'd like you to measure us.",572
18511,"2012m6","And because of all of the activity around what we've been doing and what we've announced today, I haven't really shaken that and thought sure about it but we will be telling you more about our return targets going forward.",572
18511,"2012m6","Daniel Garrod from Barclays, 2 questions.",572
18511,"2012m6","Firstly in the release, you spoke about targeting top quartile cash returns.",572
18511,"2012m6","I wonder if you could put more flesh on what that comment might exactly entail? Is that benchmarking that against the peer group, if that's the case, who might that peer group be? Just interested around the sort of what you mean by top quartile there in terms of qualification.",572
18511,"2012m6","Second, Slide 25 that discusses potential pattern of use of cash, and it has 5% to 10% allocated to the debt interest expense, the suggestion from that will be you're targeting reducing the gross debt over a medium term to much lower than GBP 1 billion.",572
18511,"2012m6","Is that the correct interpretation to take away from that slide, and what sort of timeframe do you think you can get that gross debt down more sizeably? Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",572
18511,"2012m6","So obviously, you sense a pretty positive signal to the market by investing a substantial amount in 3i shares.",572
18511,"2012m6","What are your thoughts going forward about how to improve the alignment of interest between the other executives working in 3i and shareholders? Well, I think a big project that we want to kick off later in the summer is really about remuneration across the group.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I'm a great believer that people should feel they have a degree of ownership in a business and behave like earnest so that they're properly aligned with shareholders.",572
18511,"2012m6","And it's really how we marry that with the whole carry thing because the carry thing is important to the LPs as well.",572
18511,"2012m6","So it's a sophisticated and it's a thoughtful project but we do need to tackle that, so we'll be kicking that off in the August, I think, and you'll hear more about that.",572
18511,"2012m6","I think they'll be in absolute amount.",572
18511,"2012m6","We haven't defined what it is because we're in a very relatively low investment year, but I think over the autumn, we're going to look at what we think is what I would term a par rate of investment for the group and its 3 businesses, and then for each business, look at a vintage level so a percentage above that level that we might be prepared to invest to, so that we won't be doubling or tripling investment in the years going forward.",572
18511,"2012m6","Bill Barnard, Societe Generale.",572
18511,"2012m6","Clearly, you talked about vintage controls.",572
18511,"2012m6","Can you actually put some flesh on the bones? Will there be absolute amounts, relative amounts? How will they actually work in practice? The top quartile cash return, I think all of you would be if you look at midmarket investing and you're targeting 2x to 2.",572
18511,"2012m6","5x the cash return investment, that will put you up into the top quartile.",572
18511,"2012m6","So that is the type of ambition that we have for the more recent crop of investments and the investments going forward.",572
18511,"2012m6","In terms of the gross debt, our ambition is to take that down low of GBP 1 billion but perhaps, Julia can comment on that.",572
18511,"2012m6","I think firstly, let me deal with Infrastructure and Debt Management.",572
18511,"2012m6","I think the plan to grow those 2 businesses, there's no real reductions in staff there at all.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I think over time particularly in Debt Management, you're going to see an increase in the resources.",572
18511,"2012m6","We focus on that business in the short and the medium term.",572
18511,"2012m6","I think in terms of the investment teams, we're not going to organize it around sectors, we are going to remain with the organization primary offices.",572
18511,"2012m6","But the core of that team is going to be spending that northern Europe base so Stockholm Germany, Benelux, Paris and the U.",572
18511,"2012m6","And the sector expertise is not evenly shared against around those offices, but there are clearly different geographies where they do more in sector than one other.",572
18511,"2012m6","I gave one example of that in the slides.",572
18511,"2012m6","So they naturally work with each other.",572
18511,"2012m6","And again, the offices that remain in Asia and other places are very important in terms of the acquisitions and the business organizations that come out of those portfolio companies, whether it be China, whether it be Brazil.",572
18511,"2012m6","The eyelash brush business that we recently bought in Germany is about to build a business -- build a factory in Brazil and things like this.",572
18511,"2012m6","So there are interesting and useful network benefits to having offices in these different places.",572
18511,"2012m6","It's Henry Freeman from Investec.",572
18511,"2012m6","The Brazil office obviously is staying open, and you're focusing your investment in Private Equity in northern Europe and Brazil.",572
18511,"2012m6","Brazil seems slightly, all else considering, you're coming out of other emerging markets.",572
18511,"2012m6","Is it because it's such a new office that you don't feel the time is right to cut that? Or is it just because you're seeing such great investment opportunities, which I'd be interested in considering a lot of commentator is saying Brazil is actually becoming pretty able-priced now? Well, I was at the buyout conference last week, and I've met many of the LPs.",572
18511,"2012m6","They're clearly disappointed with the performance in that fund, but they're also -- they've been multiple investors across many of 3i's funds, and that is the first tower they've been in.",572
18511,"2012m6","All the predecessors had been very strong funds, so they're setting it in that context.",572
18511,"2012m6","There's a lot of goodwill still out there to 3i, and they would like to see 3i recover, but a great deal of frustration about what's happened in that particular find.",572
18511,"2012m6","So I mean, realistically, we have to take that back above cost and get us far above cost as we can, and we have to start sending cash back before we can realize -- really go back with our cap out to raise more money.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I think quite a number of the investments in that fund are maturing with the views of being realized in 2013 and beyond.",572
18511,"2012m6","So -- and there's a nice mixture of some of the more recent investments which are very strong, and some of the old investments which are now under control and are coming to the point where they can be sold.",572
18511,"2012m6","Any more questions? Okay.",572
18511,"2012m6","Well, I think that's it.",572
18511,"2012m6","I'm very impressed by so many people coming on a Friday afternoon.",572
18511,"2012m6","Have a good weekend.",572
18511,"2012m6","You talked about how you're thinking about recruiting people in operational background and in the investing side.",572
18511,"2012m6","Are there any other areas where you're looking to recruit, in particular, if you have got ambitions in the asset gathering area? Presumably, that's an area you might want -- you might need to bulk up in as well.",572
18511,"2012m6","It's Bruce Hamilton with Morgan Stanley.",572
18511,"2012m6","If I look -- I mean, it's probably a little unfair to look at this sort of average return on equity over the history but for last decade, I mean, around 3% the last 25 years, it's 10 percent.",572
18511,"2012m6","Clearly too, cycles where you've got, as we look forward, once you got the cost run rate down, the debt down and hopefully your team in these sort of top quartile returns, where would you hope the growth returns or your return on equity or it's come out, perhaps give us a band range depending on sort of quite normalize towards a difficult macro or is it too early to sort of touch on that? There's no specific plans at the moment.",572
18511,"2012m6","I think we're very much going to continue to manage the investments and realize them as they fall due, so there's been no other -- no other bulk or palming off approach as of the moment.",572
18511,"2012m6","I mean, we've set out the target for GBP 1 billion for the immediate term.",572
18511,"2012m6","Clearly, we don't have to look at what we have left, and we will take opportunities and account.",572
18511,"2012m6","And as realizations come through, that will give us more opportunity.",572
18511,"2012m6","Ultimately, we think that we shouldn't have any significant and less debt at the top-level company, but I do have the benefit as in very long days since sterling bonds and so it's just working out the best route to bring that down further.",572
18511,"2012m6","Firstly, hello.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've been on the road for the last 3 weeks, and I see a lot of familiar faces in the audience today, even so, 1 or 2 this morning at the AGM.",572
18511,"2012m6","So thanks for coming and thanks for your time on the roadshow.",572
18511,"2012m6","As promised, I think today, we'd like to lay out the conclusions of this strategic review, which we've been conducting over the last 6 weeks, then tell you more about the strategy towards building shareholder value.",572
18511,"2012m6","And as a shareholder in 3i, personally, I expect to see a material in these returns in due course of cash.",572
18511,"2012m6","After 6 months as to the Chief Investment Officer and having a chance to consider what 3i should look like, it's clear to me that the 3i investment proposition has 3 strong investment platforms: a focused mid-market Private Equity business; a class-leading Infrastructure business; and a growing Debt Management business.",572
18511,"2012m6","Our competitive advantage lies in our strong local networks, our sector knowledge, and it lies in our capabilities and our relationships.",572
18511,"2012m6","Our financial aim is to align our costs with our income, fund new investment from realizations and produce top quartile returns for shareholders over the long term.",572
18511,"2012m6","To deliver on that, we've got together house in order first.",572
18511,"2012m6","We wouldn't tolerate a cost income imbalance like we have today in a 3i portfolio company.",572
18511,"2012m6","So why should we hear? We've also got to rebuild our reputation for top quartile investing.",572
18511,"2012m6","And we then need to use that goodwill to generate a higher proportion of third-party fee income.",572
18511,"2012m6","This is how the group looks today.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're still a leading investor in mid-market Private Equity, but we also have a leading franchise in Infrastructure and a growing Debt Management business.",572
18511,"2012m6","The group has very strong international teams who have deep knowledge and solid relationships across key sectors in their geographies.",572
18511,"2012m6","For instance, we have a very strong position in engineering in Germany.",572
18511,"2012m6","The brand is very well-regarded internationally, and we've recently made some attractive investments which you can see on this slide.",572
18511,"2012m6","This show the reach of 3i's international investing teams.",572
18511,"2012m6","As I said a minute ago, I had the benefit of being the Chief Investment Officer for 6 months before becoming CEO.",572
18511,"2012m6","That role gave me the opportunity to focus on 3i's investment processes, as well as on its portfolio of investments.",572
18511,"2012m6","It also gave me the opportunity to assess why the company was producing such poor returns for shareholders and limited partners and actually underperforming as a business itself.",572
18511,"2012m6","So why has 3i performed so poorly? And what do we plan to do to get the house back in order? I'd also like to talk about how we plan to improve our investment track record.",572
18511,"2012m6","And by addressing these 2 fundamental areas, we can put 3i back on course to generate significant value for shareholders and for the limited partners as a group.",572
18511,"2012m6","3i's origins were as a regional Private Equity business, and in many ways, 3i has remained a decentralized and somewhat unfocused group.",572
18511,"2012m6","The international network is very broad for its resource base, and that means a number of our overseas offices are subscale and very expensive to run.",572
18511,"2012m6","The controls from the center have also been weak.",572
18511,"2012m6","That lack of central control has led to inconsistency in investment and asset management processes.",572
18511,"2012m6","And while 3i's changed by largely focusing on management buyouts where it takes a majority stake, we don't appear to have managed those investments as actively as our competitors do.",572
18511,"2012m6","Again, the old approach of taking passive minority stakes may be influencing this behavior.",572
18511,"2012m6","By contrast, Infrastructure and Debt Management have an organization and a culture with much tighter central control.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I believe that has been an important part of their success.",572
18511,"2012m6","There's also been a serious problem in massively over-investing at the top of the cycle, just where prices and leverage are normally at their highest.",572
18511,"2012m6","That was allowed to happen because there was no formal vintage limit.",572
18511,"2012m6","And what I mean by that is the average annual investment level for the 5 years between the financial years 2002 and 2006 was about GBP 850 million.",572
18511,"2012m6","And yet in financial year 2007, annual investment had jumped to GBP 1.",572
18511,"2012m6","5 billion, and in 2008, it peaked at over GBP 2 billion in one year alone.",572
18511,"2012m6","The 3i cost base has been too high for too long.",572
18511,"2012m6","Not only have we been maintaining a lot of expenses, small, international offices, but we also have Rolls-Royce Support Services, which are a hangover from a larger, bigger volume 3i.",572
18511,"2012m6","These support teams are not necessary for the 3i of today, when we're focused on a simpler business with fewer, larger investments.",572
18511,"2012m6","These structures have also created their own hierarchy and complexity in an organization that badly needs to be more decisive and a lot faster on its feet in today's very competitive world, I plan to bring greater oversight and control into the business to improve performance in Private Equity especially, as well as much tighter focus by reducing the geography of where we're going to be investing.",572
18511,"2012m6","To sharpen up our asset management, I've already initiated a number of new processes.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I'm keen to beef up the capabilities of our investment teams with a much greater operational focus.",572
18511,"2012m6","Clearly, we've got to achieve a much greater level of consistency across all our investing teams.",572
18511,"2012m6","In my view, slimming down the business will remove complexity and energize the culture, as well as helping the group live within its means.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll also make our balance sheet more efficient and reduce the interest cost of the group over time.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll also increase third-party funding under management.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're going to focus on our clear strengths in mid-market Private Equity, in our core geographies in northern Europe and in Brazil.",572
18511,"2012m6","Our deep sector expertise will also help.",572
18511,"2012m6","A major target will be to enhance the balance of operational and financial skills across the investing teams, and we'll also manage the existing portfolio far more intensively.",572
18511,"2012m6","That will mean realizing investments where we can maximize value.",572
18511,"2012m6","The greater flow of realizations at above book value, the less likely we are to trade at a material discount as we do today.",572
18511,"2012m6","In Private Equity, we'll be focusing on 4 sectors.",572
18511,"2012m6","The group has consistently generated good returns in these sectors: industrial, business services, consumer and healthcare.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've made some very good investments over the last 18 months, with strong potential for growth and value.",572
18511,"2012m6","And this portfolio has been put together under the new management of the Private Equity business.",572
18511,"2012m6","And it makes for a much stronger vintage than those weaker investments made in the financial years 2007 to 2009 under the old Private Equity leadership.",572
18511,"2012m6","This slide presents my view of our portfolio in each of our regions.",572
18511,"2012m6","You can see the traffic lights on the right indicating the problems in our legacy portfolio, and it's been useful in the review we've done on the future shape of our office network.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've decided to combine our 2 Private Equity divisions and to focus new investments on northern Europe and Brazil.",572
18511,"2012m6","We are suspending investment in Spain and across Asia, and we're changing our focus to portfolio management in those regions.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're closing offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai, and we'll be significantly reducing the staff in our Beijing, Madrid, Mumbai, New York and Singapore offices.",572
18511,"2012m6","And while we'll be scaling back the breadth of our Private Equity network, we're planning to continue to grow our strong and successful businesses in Infrastructure and Debt Management.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I'll be saying more about these 2 good businesses in due course.",572
18511,"2012m6","As I just said, we've already seen some much better investments made under the leadership of the current Private Equity team, but we're going to be taking further steps to improve the consistency and discipline of our approach to asset management across all our international teams going forward.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll be taking a highly selective approach to new investments and considering each one in the context of a broader capital allocation policy, as well as implementing an annual vintage control policy for 3i balance sheet investments while being consistent with our ongoing fund commitments.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've redesigned the investment review processes around management assessment, as well as improving the way we monitor and we track our existing investments.",572
18511,"2012m6","In particular, we are changing the way we assess chief executives and senior board members of portfolio companies.",572
18511,"2012m6","From now on, the 3i investment committee will be involved in all chief executive appointments as opposed to leaving these key decisions to the investment teams in the field.",572
18511,"2012m6","Since I joined in October last year, I've been working closely with the management of the Private Equity division, and we've been reviewing our investment approach and our asset management approach, with 6 major initiatives underway now, which in time, will make a crucial difference to our current portfolio of 90 Private Equity investments, as well as future investments.",572
18511,"2012m6","These 6 improvements will be implemented over the balance of the year and completed by November.",572
18511,"2012m6","On costs, 3i became a very fat organization at the peak in the 2008 financial year with operating costs of GBP 290 million.",572
18511,"2012m6","Over the last 4 years, these costs have been reduced to some GBP 180 million as was reported in March, and I plan to take them down further this year.",572
18511,"2012m6","I spent the last 6 weeks leading a review of our costs with our business line and function heads.",572
18511,"2012m6","There've been no sacred cows in this review, and we've worked hard to figure out exactly what infrastructure we need for our new slimmed-down network.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll be taking out over 160 employees from our total staff of 435 at the end of March.",572
18511,"2012m6","Departures are starting immediately with the bulk of staff leaving by the end of September.",572
18511,"2012m6","The reduction will be completed by the end of March next year.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll also be making important savings in property cost and in travel, as well as reducing head office staff and restructuring our IT and our finance functions.",572
18511,"2012m6","These moves will result in annualized run rate cost savings of GBP 40 million by March 2013 as you can see in the green box and a total of GBP 45 million by March 2014.",572
18511,"2012m6","There'll be one-off implementation costs of about GBP 30 million, which together with timing effects, results and actual reported costs for our financial year 2013 being probably at about a similar level to 2012.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're aiming to cover our operating expenses by our cash income by March 2014, something 3i has not done for a very long time.",572
18511,"2012m6","These numbers could be amended for the Debt Management acquisition in contemplation, but we're still aiming to cover our income -- to use our income to cover our cost by that date.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're also planning to reduce the group's gross debt to save on our gross annual interest bill of GBP 103 million, which is a straight drag on shareholder returns.",572
18511,"2012m6","Over time, we hope to fundamentally change our capital allocations policy.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll get away from using capital to pay for operating costs, interest and debt repayments so that we have the scope for shareholder distributions and higher levels of reinvestment.",572
18511,"2012m6","We will do that by reducing our operating costs and our interest bill.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're also focused on growing income from our portfolio, as well as increasing third-party income.",572
18511,"2012m6","The group announced a rebased dividend in November last year, and we defined a basis for shareholder distributions at 15% to 20% of gross cash proceeds.",572
18511,"2012m6","The immediate priority is to bring down gross debt below GBP 1 billion and to remain below 20% gearing.",572
18511,"2012m6","I'm pleased to say that we're well on the way to the GBP 1 billion target already.",572
18511,"2012m6","So I have the benefit of being a close observer of 3i over a long period of time and of having the chance to study the organization from the inside during the last 6 months.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've now got a clear and more realistic strategy and a vision of where we're headed.",572
18511,"2012m6","The remaining team is very focused on delivering value to our shareholders and our limited partners.",572
18511,"2012m6","The financial year 2013 will be a transitional year: restructuring, focusing the network and significantly reducing our operating and our funding costs, as well as tackling our investment and asset management processes.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're operating in a challenging macro environment, but our portfolio is actually maturing well, and we expect the building level of realizations as we enter 2013.",572
18511,"2012m6","And that will mean that our shareholders will have a direct participation in those realizations.",572
18511,"2012m6","And finally, we plan to use our corporate calendar going forward to keep you informed about our progress in hitting the key milestones that I've just laid out.",572
18511,"2012m6","Now before I close, I would just like to leave you with a couple of thoughts.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've got a clear vision of where we aim to take 3i and I'm excited about this challenge.",572
18511,"2012m6","Over my career, I've worked with a lot of Britain's best companies, and it's clear to me that there are a few special things that underpin strong businesses: a clear vision that guides an ambitious but realistic strategy; integrity and respect for individuals whether they be colleagues, customers or suppliers; high-energy levels and a good work ethic; and clear decisions based on thorough analysis followed by rapid follow-through.",572
18511,"2012m6","These values have served me well through my career, and I'm sure they'll be central to bringing 3i back to the top of this game.",572
18511,"2012m6","In my book, that means everybody at 3i has got to demonstrate our investing and asset management skills to our shareholders and our limited partners.",572
18511,"2012m6","Thanks for your time and we're happy to take Q&A now.",572
18511,"2012m6","Can you also say a few words about the structured deal's going forward with the funds reaching the end of their investment period in terms of majority stakes and whether you might syndicate some of that out with other investors? Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",572
18511,"2012m6","I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the shape of the investment teams going forward.",572
18511,"2012m6","There's obviously going to be a lot of change geographically.",572
18511,"2012m6","Should we assume that there'll be little change to the infrastructure and the debt side? And on the Private Equity side, how will that be organized going forward? Will it be on industry sectors? And what sort of change do you anticipate in a number of investment executives? Can you also say a few words about how the structured deals going forward with the funds reaching the end of their investment period in terms of majority stakes and whether you might syndicate some of that out with other investors? It's Bruce Hamilton, Morgan Stanley.",572
18511,"2012m6","If I look -- I mean, it's probably a little unfair to look at this sort of average return on equity over history.",572
18511,"2012m6","But the last decade, I think, is around 3%, the last 25 years is 10%.",572
18511,"2012m6","Clearly, that included 2 cycles where you got over your skis.",572
18511,"2012m6","As we look forward, once you've got the cost run rate down, the debt down and hopefully you're achieving these sort of top quartile returns, where would you hope in your gross returns or your return on equity for it come out? Perhaps give us a band range depending on sort of quite normalized or a difficult macro or is it too early to sort of touch on that? There's no specific plans at the moment.",572
18511,"2012m6","I think we're very much going to continue to manage the investments and realize them as they fall due.",572
18511,"2012m6","So there's been no other -- no other bulk or palming off approach as of the moment.",572
18511,"2012m6","It's Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",572
18511,"2012m6","I was wondering if you'd talk a bit about the shape of the investment teams going forward.",572
18511,"2012m6","There's obviously going to be a lot of change geographically.",572
18511,"2012m6","Should we assume that there'll be little change to the Infrastructure and Debt side? And on the Private Equity side, how will that be organized going forward? Will it be on industry sectors? And what sort of change do you anticipate in the number of investment executives? Well, I was at the Buyout Conference last week, and I've met many of the LPs.",572
18511,"2012m6","They're clearly disappointed with the performance of their fund, but they're also -- they've been multiple investors across many of 3i's funds, and that is the first hollow they've been.",572
18511,"2012m6","All the predecessors have been very strong funds, so they're setting it in that context.",572
18511,"2012m6","There's a lot of goodwill still out there to 3i, and they would like to see 3i recover, but a great deal of frustration about what's happened in that particular fund.",572
18511,"2012m6","So I mean, realistically, we have to take that back above cost and get us far above cost as we can, and we have to start sending cash back before we can realize -- really go back with our cap out to raise more money.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I think quite a number of the investments in that fund are maturing with a view to being realized in 2013 and beyond.",572
18511,"2012m6","So -- and there's a nice mixture of some of the more recent investments which are very strong, and some of the old investments which are now under control and are coming to the point where they can be sold.",572
18511,"2012m6","I think firstly, let me deal with Infrastructure and Debt Management.",572
18511,"2012m6","I think the plan is to grow those 2 businesses.",572
18511,"2012m6","There's no real reductions in staff there at all.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I think over time, particularly in Debt Management, you're going to see an increase in the resources we focus on that business in the short and the medium term.",572
18511,"2012m6","I think in terms of the investment teams, we're not going to organize it around sectors, we are going to remain with the organization, primarily around offices.",572
18511,"2012m6","But the core of that team is going to be spanning that Northern Europe base, so Stockholm, Germany, Benelux, Paris and the U.",572
18511,"2012m6","And the sector expertise is not evenly shared against, around those offices, but there are clearly different geographies where they do more in sector than one other.",572
18511,"2012m6","I gave one example of that in the slides.",572
18511,"2012m6","So they naturally work with each other.",572
18511,"2012m6","And again, the offices that remain in Asia and other places are very important in terms of the acquisitions and the business organizations that come out of those portfolio companies, whether it be China, whether it be Brazil.",572
18511,"2012m6","GEKA, the eyelash brush business that we recently bought in Germany is about to build a business in -- build a factory in Brazil and things like this.",572
18511,"2012m6","So there are interesting and useful network benefits to having offices in these different places.",572
18511,"2012m6","It's a number of things.",572
18511,"2012m6","In my prior job, we interviewed many teams in Brazil to open a Greenhill office.",572
18511,"2012m6","And having met our Brazilian team, I think we have got one of the best teams operating in that market.",572
18511,"2012m6","So whoever recruited them, Michael, I guess, did a very good job.",572
18511,"2012m6","So as an individual team, relative competence and all of that, that very high, high order.",572
18511,"2012m6","If you look at the WIP, our work-in-progress pipeline, it's very strong in that market.",572
18511,"2012m6","And also, we're able to source things outside of auctions.",572
18511,"2012m6","So we're satisfied we're not paying very toppy prices for the things we've been doing as with the case with Blue Interactive.",572
18511,"2012m6","And the third thing is our limited partners have expressed interest in a Brazil-only fund.",572
18511,"2012m6","So that's a serious agenda item in due course because people are very interested in that economy.",572
18511,"2012m6","And so we think we can raise a very discrete mid-market Private Equity fund for that Brazilian team.",572
18511,"2012m6","It's Henry Freeman from Investec.",572
18511,"2012m6","The Brazil office obviously is staying open, and you're focusing new investment in Private Equity in Northern Europe and Brazil.",572
18511,"2012m6","Brazil seems slightly odd considering you're coming out of other emerging markets.",572
18511,"2012m6","Is it because it's such a new office that you don't feel the time is right to cut that? Or is it just because you're seeing such great investment opportunities, which I'd be interested in considering a lot of commentators are saying Brazil is actually becoming pretty overpriced now? I'd rather not say anything on that at the moment.",572
18511,"2012m6","We are in the process of developing a model for the business.",572
18511,"2012m6","And we did signal on that chart, the milestone chart, that at a point in time, we're going to give you some KPIs on which we'd like you to measure us.",572
18511,"2012m6","And because of all the activity around what we've been doing and what we've announced today, I haven't really shaken that and got sure about it, but we will be telling you more about our return targets going forward.",572
18511,"2012m6","I had quite a lot of experience of this, again, at Greenhill because one of the initiatives we took before I left was to build up a third-party fundraising team.",572
18511,"2012m6","And we took the old private equity team out of Lehman Brothers, and we took the property team out of Credit Suisse, and that became the nucleus of our third-party fund business.",572
18511,"2012m6","And looking at what's effective in terms of that activity is you need some geographic people covering key accounts in key locations, whether they're across North America, Europe, the Middle East or the Far East.",572
18511,"2012m6","And we really are quite spotty in that regard in terms of our -- we have some very deep relationships with LPs, but we don't have some broad ones.",572
18511,"2012m6","And we need a proper structure around that whole fundraising activity, which gives us some proper geographic coverage and some functional support in terms of our different product bases, be it the Infrastructure, Debt or Private Equity.",572
18511,"2012m6","So we'll be resourcing up the fund-raising capability in the group.",572
18511,"2012m6","Any more questions? Okay.",572
18511,"2012m6","Well, I think that's it.",572
18511,"2012m6","I'm very impressed by so many people coming on a Friday afternoon.",572
18511,"2012m6","Have a good weekend.",572
18511,"2012m6","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",572
18511,"2012m6","Simon, obviously, you sent a pretty positive signal to the market by investing a substantial amount in 3i shares.",572
18511,"2012m6","What are your thoughts going forward about how you can improve the alignment of interest between the other executives working at 3i and shareholders? Bill Barnard, Societe Generale.",572
18511,"2012m6","Clearly, you talked about vintage controls.",572
18511,"2012m6","Can you actually put some flesh on the bones? Will they be absolute amounts, relative amounts? How will they actually work in practice? Yes.",572
18511,"2012m6","I mean, we've set out the target for GBP 1 billion for the immediate term.",572
18511,"2012m6","Clearly, we don't have to look at what we have left, and we will take opportunities as we can.",572
18511,"2012m6","And as realizations come through, that will give us more opportunity.",572
18511,"2012m6","Ultimately, we think that we shouldn't have any significant amount of debt at the top-level company, but I do have the benefit of some very long dated sterling bonds, and so it's just working out the best route to bring that down further.",572
18511,"2012m6","Philip Middleton, Merrill.",572
18511,"2012m6","You've talked about how you're thinking about recruiting people with an operational background in the investing side.",572
18511,"2012m6","Are there any other areas where you're looking to recruit, in particular, if you have got ambitions in the asset gathering area? Presumably, that's an area you might want -- you might need to bulk up in as well.",572
18511,"2012m6","And perhaps as a follow up, in terms of the returns on your fund, so I think clearly, that's disappointed thus far.",572
18511,"2012m6","I mean, how long do you think it will take to recover the relationships with the LPs to realistically think about launching a fund? I mean, and what sort of -- what are the steps towards that? Is it getting to 1.",572
18511,"2012m6","5x? I mean, how should we think about that process? Firstly, hello.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've been on the road for the last 3 weeks, and I see a lot of familiar faces in the audience today.",572
18511,"2012m6","I even saw 1 or 2 this morning at the AGM.",572
18511,"2012m6","So thanks for coming and thanks for your time on the roadshow.",572
18511,"2012m6","As promised, I think today, we'd like to lay out the conclusions of this strategic review, which we've been conducting over the last 6 weeks, then tell you more about the strategy for the building of shareholder value.",572
18511,"2012m6","And as a shareholder in 3i, personally, I expect to see a material part of these returns in due course as cash.",572
18511,"2012m6","After 6 months as the Chief Investment Officer and having a chance to consider what 3i should look like, it's clear to me that the 3i investment proposition has 3 strong investment platforms: a focused mid-market Private Equity business, a class-leading Infrastructure business, and a growing Debt Management business.",572
18511,"2012m6","Our competitive advantage lies in our strong local network, our sector knowledge, and it lies in our capabilities and our relationships.",572
18511,"2012m6","Our financial aim is to align our costs with our income, fund new investment from realizations and produce top quartile returns for shareholders over the long term.",572
18511,"2012m6","To deliver on that, we've got to get our house in order first.",572
18511,"2012m6","We wouldn't tolerate a cost/income imbalance like we have today in a 3i portfolio company.",572
18511,"2012m6","So why should we hear? We've also got to rebuild our reputation for top quartile investing.",572
18511,"2012m6","And we then need to use that goodwill to generate a higher proportion of third-party fee income.",572
18511,"2012m6","This is how the group looks today.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're still a leading investor in mid-market Private Equity, but we also have a leading franchise in Infrastructure and a growing Debt Management business.",572
18511,"2012m6","The group has very strong international teams who have deep knowledge and solid relationships across key sectors in their geographies.",572
18511,"2012m6","For instance, we have a very strong position in engineering in Germany.",572
18511,"2012m6","The brand is very well-regarded internationally, and we've recently made some attractive investments, which you can see on this slide.",572
18511,"2012m6","These show the reach of 3i's international investing teams.",572
18511,"2012m6","As I said a minute ago, I had the benefit of being the Chief Investment Officer for 6 months before becoming CEO.",572
18511,"2012m6","That role gave me the opportunity to focus on 3i's investment processes, as well as on its portfolio of investments.",572
18511,"2012m6","It also gave me the opportunity to assess why the company was producing such poor returns for shareholders and limited partners and actually underperforming as a business itself.",572
18511,"2012m6","So why has 3i performed so poorly? And what do we plan to do to get the house back in order? I'd also like to talk about how we plan to improve our investment track record.",572
18511,"2012m6","And by addressing these 2 fundamental areas, we can put 3i back on course to generate significant value for shareholders and for the limited partners of the group.",572
18511,"2012m6","3i's origins were as a regional private equity business, and in many ways, 3i has remained a decentralized and somewhat unfocused group.",572
18511,"2012m6","The international network is very broad for its resource base, and that means a number of our overseas offices are subscale and very expensive to run.",572
18511,"2012m6","The controls from the center have also been weak.",572
18511,"2012m6","That lack of central control has led to inconsistency in investment and asset management processes.",572
18511,"2012m6","And while 3i has changed by largely focusing on management buyouts where it takes a majority stake, we don't appear to have managed those investments as actively as our competitors do.",572
18511,"2012m6","Again, the old approach of taking passive minority stakes may be influencing this behavior.",572
18511,"2012m6","By contrast, Infrastructure and Debt Management have an organization and a culture with much tighter central control.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I believe that has been an important part of their success.",572
18511,"2012m6","There's also been a serious problem in massively overinvesting at the top of the cycle, just where prices and leverage are normally at their highest.",572
18511,"2012m6","That was allowed to happen because there was no formal vintage limit.",572
18511,"2012m6","And what I mean by that is the average annual investment level for the 5 years between the financial years 2002 and 2006 was about GBP 850 million.",572
18511,"2012m6","And yet in financial year 2007, annual investment had jumped to GBP 1.",572
18511,"2012m6","5 billion, and in 2008, it peaked at over GBP 2 billion in one year alone.",572
18511,"2012m6","The 3i cost base has been too high for too long.",572
18511,"2012m6","Not only have we been maintaining a lot of expensive, small international offices, but we also have Rolls-Royce support services, which are hangover from a larger, bigger volume 3i.",572
18511,"2012m6","These support teams are not necessary for the 3i of today, when we're focused on a simpler business with fewer, larger investments.",572
18511,"2012m6","These structures have also created their own hierarchy and complexity.",572
18511,"2012m6","In an organization that badly needs to be more decisive and a lot faster on its feet in today's very competitive world, I plan to bring greater oversight and control into the business to improve performance in Private Equity especially, as well as much tighter focus by reducing of the geography of where we're going to be investing.",572
18511,"2012m6","To sharpen up our asset management, I've already initiated a number of new processes.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I'm keen to beef up the capabilities of our investment teams with a much greater operational focus.",572
18511,"2012m6","Clearly, we've got to achieve a much greater level of consistency across all our investing teams.",572
18511,"2012m6","In my view, slimming down the business will remove complexity and energize the culture, as well as helping the group live within its means.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll also make our balance sheet more efficient and reduce the interest cost of the group over time.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll also increase third-party funds under management.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're going to focus on our clear strengths in mid-market Private Equity, in our core geographies in Northern Europe and in Brazil.",572
18511,"2012m6","Our deep sector expertise will also help.",572
18511,"2012m6","A major target will be to enhance the balance of operational and financial skills across the investing teams, and we'll also manage the existing portfolio far more intensively.",572
18511,"2012m6","That will mean realizing investments where we can maximize value.",572
18511,"2012m6","The greater flow of realizations at above book value, the less likely we are to trade at a material discount as we do today.",572
18511,"2012m6","In Private Equity, we'll be focusing on 4 sectors.",572
18511,"2012m6","The group has consistently generated good returns in these sectors: industrial, business services, consumer and health care.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've made some very good investments over the last 18 months, with strong potential for growth in value.",572
18511,"2012m6","And this portfolio has been put together under the new management of the Private Equity business.",572
18511,"2012m6","And it makes for a much stronger vintage than those weaker investments made in the financial years 2007 to 2009 under the old Private Equity leadership.",572
18511,"2012m6","This slide presents my view of our portfolio in each of our regions.",572
18511,"2012m6","You can see the traffic lights on the right indicating the problems in our legacy portfolio, and it's been useful in the review we've done on the future shape of our office network.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've decided to combine our 2 Private Equity divisions and to focus new investments on Northern Europe and Brazil.",572
18511,"2012m6","We are suspending investment in Spain and across Asia, and we're changing our focus to portfolio management in those regions.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're closing offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai, and we'll be significantly reducing the staff in our Beijing, Madrid, Mumbai, New York and Singapore offices.",572
18511,"2012m6","And while we'll be scaling back the breadth of our Private Equity network, we're planning to continue to grow our strong and successful businesses in Infrastructure and Debt Management.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I'll be saying more about these 2 good businesses in due course.",572
18511,"2012m6","As I just said, we've already seen some much better investments made under the leadership of the current Private Equity team, but we're going to be taking further steps to improve the consistency and discipline of our approach to asset management across all our international teams going forward.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll be taking a highly selective approach to new investments and considering each one in the context of a broader capital allocation policy, as well as implementing an annual vintage control policy for 3i balance sheet investments, while being consistent with our ongoing fund commitments.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've redesigned the investment review processes around management assessments, as well as improving the way we monitor and we track our existing investments.",572
18511,"2012m6","In particular, we are changing the way we assess chief executives and senior board members of portfolio companies.",572
18511,"2012m6","From now on, the 3i Investment Committee will be involved in all chief executive appointments as opposed to leaving these key decisions to the investment teams in the field.",572
18511,"2012m6","Since I joined in October last year, I've been working closely with the management of the Private Equity division, and we've been reviewing our investment approach and our asset management approach.",572
18511,"2012m6","We have 6 major initiatives underway now, which in time, will make a crucial difference to our current portfolio of 90 Private Equity investments, as well as future investments.",572
18511,"2012m6","These 6 improvements will be implemented over the balance of the year and completed by November.",572
18511,"2012m6","On costs, 3i became a very fat organization at the peak in the 2008 financial year with operating cost of GBP 290 million.",572
18511,"2012m6","Over the last 4 years, these costs have been reduced to some GBP 180 million as was reported in March, and I plan to take them down further this year.",572
18511,"2012m6","I spent the last 6 weeks leading a review of our cost with our business line and function heads.",572
18511,"2012m6","There've been no sacred cows in this review, and we've worked hard to figure out exactly what infrastructure we need for our new slimmed-down network.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll be taking out over 160 employees from our total staff of 435 at the end of March.",572
18511,"2012m6","Departures are starting immediately with the bulk of staff leaving by the end of September.",572
18511,"2012m6","The reduction will be completed by the end of March next year.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll also be making important savings in property cost and in travel, as well as reducing head office staff and restructuring our IT and our finance functions.",572
18511,"2012m6","These moves will result in annualized run rate cost savings of GBP 40 million by March 2013 as you can see in the green box and a total of GBP 45 million by March 2014.",572
18511,"2012m6","There'll be one-off implementation costs of about GBP 30 million, which together with timing effects, results in actual reported costs for our financial year 2013 being probably at about a similar level for 2012.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're aiming to cover our operating expenses by our cash income by March 2014, something 3i has not done for a very long time.",572
18511,"2012m6","These numbers could be amended for the Debt Management acquisition in contemplation, but we're still aiming to cover our income -- to use our income to cover our cost by that date.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're also planning to reduce the group's gross debt to save on our gross annual interest bill of GBP 103 million, which is a straight drag on shareholder returns.",572
18511,"2012m6","Over time, we hope to fundamentally change our capital allocations policy.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll get away from using capital to pay for operating costs, interest and debt repayments so that we have the scope for shareholder distributions and higher levels of reinvestment.",572
18511,"2012m6","We will do that by reducing our operating costs and our interest bill.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're also focused on growing income from our portfolio, as well as increasing third-party income.",572
18511,"2012m6","The group announced a rebased dividend in November last year, and we defined the basis for shareholder distributions at 15% to 20% of gross cash proceeds.",572
18511,"2012m6","The immediate priority is to bring down gross debt below GBP 1 billion and to remain below 20% gearing.",572
18511,"2012m6","I'm pleased to say that we're well on the way to the GBP 1 billion target already.",572
18511,"2012m6","So I have the benefit of being a close observer of 3i over a long period of time and of having the chance to study the organization from inside during the last 6 months.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've now got a clear and more realistic strategy and a vision of where we're headed.",572
18511,"2012m6","The remaining team is very focused on delivering value to our shareholders and our limited partners.",572
18511,"2012m6","The financial year 2013 will be a transitional year of restructuring, focusing the network and significantly reducing our operating and our funding costs, as well as tackling our investment and asset management processes.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're operating in a challenging macro environment, but our portfolio is actually maturing well, and we expect a building level of realizations as we enter 2013.",572
18511,"2012m6","And that will mean that our shareholders will have a direct participation in those realizations.",572
18511,"2012m6","And finally, we plan to use our corporate calendar going forward to keep you informed about our progress in hitting the key milestones that I've just laid out.",572
18511,"2012m6","Now before I close, I would just like to leave you with a couple of thoughts.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've got a clear vision of where we aim to take 3i, and I'm excited about this challenge.",572
18511,"2012m6","Over my career, I've worked with a lot of Britain's best companies, and it's clear to me that there are a few special things that underpin strong businesses: a clear vision that guides an ambitious but realistic strategy; integrity and respect for individuals, whether they'd be colleagues, customers or suppliers; high-energy levels and a good work ethic; and clear decisions based on thorough analysis followed by rapid follow-through.",572
18511,"2012m6","These values have served me well through my career, and I'm sure they'll be central to bringing 3i back to the top of its game.",572
18511,"2012m6","In my book, that means everybody at 3i has got to demonstrate our investing and asset management skills to our shareholders and our limited partners.",572
18511,"2012m6","Thanks for your time, and we're happy to take Q&A now.",572
18511,"2012m6","The top quartile cash returns, I think our view would be if you look at mid-market investing, and you're targeting 2 to 2.",572
18511,"2012m6","5x of the cash return in the investment, that will put you up into the top quartile.",572
18511,"2012m6","So that is the type of ambition that we have for the more recent crop of investments and the investments going forward.",572
18511,"2012m6","In terms of the gross debt, our ambition is to take that down lower than GBP 1 billion, but perhaps Julia can comment on that.",572
18511,"2012m6","I think they'll be an absolute amount.",572
18511,"2012m6","We haven't defined what it is because we're in a very -- a relatively low investment year, but I think over the autumn, we're going to look at what we think is what I would term a par rate of investment for the group and its 3 businesses, and then for each business, look at a vintage level.",572
18511,"2012m6","So a percentage above that level that we might be prepared to invest to.",572
18511,"2012m6","So that we won't be doubling or tripling investment in years going forward.",572
18511,"2012m6","Daniel Garrod from Barclays, 2 questions.",572
18511,"2012m6","Firstly in the release, you spoke about targeting top quartile cash returns.",572
18511,"2012m6","I wonder if you could put more flesh on what that comment might exactly entail? Is that benchmarking that against a peer group? If that's the case, who might that peer group be? Just interested around the sort of what you mean by top quartile there in terms of quantification.",572
18511,"2012m6","Second, your Slide 25 that discusses potential pattern of use of cash, and it has 5% to 10% allocated to the debt interest expense, the suggestion from that would be you're targeting reducing the gross debt over the medium term to much lower than GBP 1 billion.",572
18511,"2012m6","Is that the correct interpretation to take away from that slide, and over what sort of timeframe do you think you can get that gross debt down amount sizeably? Well, I think a big project that we want to kick off later in the summer is really about remuneration across the group.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I'm a great believer that people should feel they have a degree of ownership in a business and behave like owners so they're properly aligned with shareholders.",572
18511,"2012m6","And it's really how we marry that with the whole carry thing because the carry thing is important to the LPs as well.",572
18511,"2012m6","So it's a sophisticated and it's a thoughtful project, but we do need to tackle that.",572
18511,"2012m6","So we'll be kicking that off in the August, I think, and you'll hear more about that.",572
18511,"2012m6","Can you also say a few words about how the structured deals going forward with the funds reaching the end of their investment period in terms of majority stakes and whether you might syndicate some of that out with other investors? Yes.",572
18511,"2012m6","I had quite a lot of experience of this, again, at Greenhill because one of the initiatives we took before I left was to build up a third-party fundraising team.",572
18511,"2012m6","And we took the old private equity team out of Lehman Brothers, and we took the property team out of Crédit Suisse, and that became the nucleus of our third-party fund business.",572
18511,"2012m6","And looking at what's effective in terms of that activity is you need some geographic people covering key accounts in key locations, whether they're across North America, Europe, the Middle East or the Far East.",572
18511,"2012m6","And we really are quite spotty in that regard in terms of our -- we have some very deep relationships with LPs, but we don't have some broad ones.",572
18511,"2012m6","And we need a proper structure around that whole fundraising activity, which gives us some proper geographic coverage and some functional support in terms of our different product bases, be it Infrastructure, Debt or Private Equity.",572
18511,"2012m6","So we'll be resourcing up the fundraising capability in the group.",572
18511,"2012m6","Any more questions? Okay.",572
18511,"2012m6","Well, I think that's it.",572
18511,"2012m6","I'm very impressed by so many people coming on a Friday afternoon.",572
18511,"2012m6","Have a good weekend.",572
18511,"2012m6","Well, I think a big project that we want to kick off later in the summer is really about remuneration across the group.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I'm a great believer that people should feel they have a degree of ownership in a business and behave like owners so that they're properly aligned with shareholders.",572
18511,"2012m6","And it's really how we marry that with the whole carry thing because the carry thing is important to the LPs as well.",572
18511,"2012m6","So it's a sophisticated and it's a thoughtful project, but we do need to tackle that.",572
18511,"2012m6","So we'll be kicking that off in the August, I think, and you'll hear more about that.",572
18511,"2012m6","Bill Barnard, Société Générale.",572
18511,"2012m6","Clearly, you talked about vintage controls.",572
18511,"2012m6","Can you actually put some flesh on the bones? Will they be absolute amounts, relative amounts? How will they actually work in practice? I'd rather not say anything on that at the moment.",572
18511,"2012m6","We are in the process of developing a model for the business.",572
18511,"2012m6","And we did signal on that chart, the milestone chart, that at a point in time, we're going to give you some KPIs on which we'd like you to measure us.",572
18511,"2012m6","And because of all the activity around what we've been doing and what we've announced today, I haven't really shaken that and got sure about it, but we will be telling you more about our return targets going forward.",572
18511,"2012m6","There's no specific plans at the moment.",572
18511,"2012m6","I think we're very much going to continue to manage the investments and realize them as they fall due.",572
18511,"2012m6","So there's been no other -- no other bulk or palming off approach as of the moment.",572
18511,"2012m6","Daniel Garrod from Barclays, 2 questions.",572
18511,"2012m6","Firstly in the release, you spoke about targeting top quartile cash returns.",572
18511,"2012m6","I wonder if you could put more flesh on what that comment might exactly entail? Is that benchmarking that against a peer group? If that's the case, who might that peer group be? Just interested around the sort of what you mean by top quartile there in terms of quantification.",572
18511,"2012m6","Second, your Slide 25 that discusses potential pattern of use of cash only has 5% to 10% allocated to the debt interest expense.",572
18511,"2012m6","The suggestion from that would be you're targeting reducing the gross debt over the medium term to much lower than GBP 1 billion.",572
18511,"2012m6","Is that the correct interpretation to take away from that slide? And over what sort of time frame do you think you can get that gross debt down more sizably? It's Bruce Hamilton, Morgan Stanley.",572
18511,"2012m6","If I look -- I mean, it's probably a little unfair to look at this sort of average return on equity over history.",572
18511,"2012m6","But the last decade, I think, is around 3%, the last 25 years is 10%.",572
18511,"2012m6","Clearly, that included 2 cycles where you got over your skis.",572
18511,"2012m6","As we look forward, once you've got the cost run rate down, the debt down and hopefully you're achieving these sort of top quartile returns, where would you hope -- either your gross returns or your return on equity for it come out? Perhaps give us a band range depending on sort of quite normalized or a difficult macro or is it too early to sort of touch on that? It's a number of things.",572
18511,"2012m6","In my prior job, we interviewed many teams in Brazil to open a Greenhill office.",572
18511,"2012m6","And having met our Brazilian team, I think we have got one of the best teams operating in that market.",572
18511,"2012m6","So whoever recruited them, Michael [ph], I guess, did a very good job.",572
18511,"2012m6","So as an individual team, relative competence and all of that, that very high, high order.",572
18511,"2012m6","If you look at the WIP, our work-in-progress pipeline, it's very strong in that market.",572
18511,"2012m6","And also, we're able to source things outside of auctions.",572
18511,"2012m6","So we're satisfied we're not paying very toppy prices for the things we've been doing as with the case with Blue Interactive.",572
18511,"2012m6","And the third thing is our limited partners have expressed interest in a Brazil-only fund.",572
18511,"2012m6","So that's a serious agenda item in due course because people are very interested in that economy.",572
18511,"2012m6","And so we think we can raise a very discrete mid-market Private Equity fund for that Brazilian team.",572
18511,"2012m6","I think firstly, let me deal with Infrastructure and Debt Management.",572
18511,"2012m6","I think the plan is to grow those 2 businesses.",572
18511,"2012m6","There's no real reductions in staff there at all.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I think over time, particularly in Debt Management, you're going to see an increase in the resources we focus on that business in the short and the medium term.",572
18511,"2012m6","I think in terms of the investment teams, we're not going to organize it around sectors.",572
18511,"2012m6","We are going to remain with the organization, primarily around offices.",572
18511,"2012m6","But the core of that team is going to be spanning that Northern Europe base, so Stockholm, Germany, Benelux, Paris and the U.",572
18511,"2012m6","And the sector expertise is not evenly shared against -- around those offices, but there are clearly different geographies where they do more in sector than one other.",572
18511,"2012m6","I gave one example of that in the slides.",572
18511,"2012m6","So they naturally work with each other.",572
18511,"2012m6","And again, the offices that remain in Asia and other places are very important in terms of the acquisitions and the business organizations that come out of those portfolio companies, whether it be China, whether it be Brazil.",572
18511,"2012m6","GEKA, the eyelash brush business that we recently bought in Germany is about to build a business in -- build a factory in Brazil and things like this.",572
18511,"2012m6","So there are interesting and useful network benefits to having offices in these different places.",572
18511,"2012m6","Firstly, hello.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've been on the road for the last 3 weeks, and I see a lot of familiar faces in the audience today.",572
18511,"2012m6","I even saw 1 or 2 this morning at the AGM.",572
18511,"2012m6","So thanks for coming and thanks for your time on the roadshow.",572
18511,"2012m6","As promised, I think today, we'd like to lay out the conclusions of this strategic review, which we've been conducting over the last 6 weeks, then tell you more about the strategy for the building of shareholder value.",572
18511,"2012m6","And as a shareholder in 3i, personally, I expect to see a material part of these returns in due course as cash.",572
18511,"2012m6","After 6 months as the Chief Investment Officer and having a chance to consider what 3i should look like, it's clear to me that the 3i investment proposition has 3 strong investment platforms: a focused mid-market Private Equity business, a class-leading Infrastructure business, and a growing Debt Management business.",572
18511,"2012m6","Our competitive advantage lies in our strong local network, our sector knowledge, and it lies in our capabilities and our relationships.",572
18511,"2012m6","Our financial aim is to align our costs with our income, fund new investment from realizations and produce top quartile returns for shareholders over the long term.",572
18511,"2012m6","To deliver on that, we've got to get our house in order first.",572
18511,"2012m6","We wouldn't tolerate a cost/income imbalance like we have today in a 3i portfolio company.",572
18511,"2012m6","So why should we here? We've also got to rebuild our reputation for top quartile investing.",572
18511,"2012m6","And we then need to use that goodwill to generate a higher proportion of third-party fee income.",572
18511,"2012m6","This is how the group looks today.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're still a leading investor in mid-market Private Equity, but we also have a leading franchise in Infrastructure and a growing Debt Management business.",572
18511,"2012m6","The group has very strong international teams who have deep knowledge and solid relationships across key sectors in their geographies.",572
18511,"2012m6","For instance, we have a very strong position in engineering in Germany.",572
18511,"2012m6","The brand is very well regarded internationally, and we've recently made some attractive investments, which you can see on this slide.",572
18511,"2012m6","These show the reach of 3i's international investing teams.",572
18511,"2012m6","As I said a minute ago, I had the benefit of being the Chief Investment Officer for 6 months before becoming CEO.",572
18511,"2012m6","That role gave me the opportunity to focus on 3i's investment processes, as well as on its portfolio of investments.",572
18511,"2012m6","It also gave me the opportunity to assess why the company was producing such poor returns for shareholders and limited partners and actually underperforming as a business itself.",572
18511,"2012m6","So why has 3i performed so poorly? And what do we plan to do to get the house back in order? I'd also like to talk about how we plan to improve our investment track record.",572
18511,"2012m6","And by addressing these 2 fundamental areas, we can put 3i back on course to generate significant value for shareholders and for the limited partners of the group.",572
18511,"2012m6","3i's origins were as a regional private equity business, and in many ways, 3i has remained a decentralized and somewhat unfocused group.",572
18511,"2012m6","The international network is very broad for its resource base, and that means a number of our overseas offices are subscale and very expensive to run.",572
18511,"2012m6","The controls from the center have also been weak.",572
18511,"2012m6","That lack of central control has led to inconsistency in investment and asset management processes.",572
18511,"2012m6","And while 3i has changed by largely focusing on management buyouts where it takes a majority stake, we don't appear to have managed those investments as actively as our competitors do.",572
18511,"2012m6","Again, the old approach of taking passive minority stakes may be influencing this behavior.",572
18511,"2012m6","By contrast, Infrastructure and Debt Management have an organization and a culture with much tighter central control.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I believe that has been an important part of their success.",572
18511,"2012m6","There's also been a serious problem in massively overinvesting at the top of the cycle, just where prices and leverage are normally at their highest.",572
18511,"2012m6","That was allowed to happen because there was no formal vintage limit.",572
18511,"2012m6","And what I mean by that is the average annual investment level for the 5 years between the financial years 2002 and 2006 was about GBP 850 million.",572
18511,"2012m6","And yet in financial year 2007, annual investment had jumped to GBP 1.",572
18511,"2012m6","5 billion, and in 2008, it peaked at over GBP 2 billion in one year alone.",572
18511,"2012m6","The 3i cost base has been too high for too long.",572
18511,"2012m6","Not only have we been maintaining a lot of expensive, small international offices, but we also have Rolls-Royce support services, which are a hangover from a larger, bigger volume 3i.",572
18511,"2012m6","These support teams are not necessary for the 3i of today, when we're focused on a simpler business with fewer, larger investments.",572
18511,"2012m6","These structures have also created their own hierarchy and complexity.",572
18511,"2012m6","In an organization that badly needs to be more decisive and a lot faster on its feet in today's very competitive world, I plan to bring greater oversight and control into the business to improve performance in Private Equity especially, as well as much tighter focus by reducing of the geography of where we're going to be investing.",572
18511,"2012m6","To sharpen up our asset management, I've already initiated a number of new processes.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I'm keen to beef up the capabilities of our investment teams with a much greater operational focus.",572
18511,"2012m6","Clearly, we've got to achieve a much greater level of consistency across all our investing teams.",572
18511,"2012m6","In my view, slimming down the business will remove complexity and energize the culture, as well as helping the group live within its means.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll also make our balance sheet more efficient and reduce the interest cost of the group over time.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll also increase third-party funds under management.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're going to focus on our clear strengths in mid-market Private Equity, in our core geographies in Northern Europe and in Brazil.",572
18511,"2012m6","Our deep sector expertise will also help.",572
18511,"2012m6","A major target will be to enhance the balance of operational and financial skills across the investing teams, and we'll also manage the existing portfolio far more intensively.",572
18511,"2012m6","That will mean realizing investments where we can maximize value.",572
18511,"2012m6","The greater flow of realizations at above book value, the less likely we are to trade at a material discount as we do today.",572
18511,"2012m6","In Private Equity, we'll be focusing on 4 sectors.",572
18511,"2012m6","The group has consistently generated good returns in these sectors: industrial, business services, consumer and health care.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've made some very good investments over the last 18 months, with strong potential for growth in value.",572
18511,"2012m6","And this portfolio has been put together under the new management of the Private Equity business.",572
18511,"2012m6","And it makes for a much stronger vintage than those weaker investments made in the financial years 2007 to 2009 under the old Private Equity leadership.",572
18511,"2012m6","This slide presents my view of our portfolio in each of our regions.",572
18511,"2012m6","You can see the traffic lights on the right indicating the problems in our legacy portfolio, and it's been useful in the review we've done on the future shape of our office network.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've decided to combine our 2 Private Equity divisions and to focus new investments on Northern Europe and Brazil.",572
18511,"2012m6","We are suspending investment in Spain and across Asia, and we're changing our focus to portfolio management in those regions.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're closing offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai, and we'll be significantly reducing the staff in our Beijing, Madrid, Mumbai, New York and Singapore offices.",572
18511,"2012m6","And while we'll be scaling back the breadth of our Private Equity network, we're planning to continue to grow our strong and successful businesses in Infrastructure and Debt Management.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I'll be saying more about these 2 good businesses in due course.",572
18511,"2012m6","As I just said, we've already seen some much better investments made under the leadership of the current Private Equity team, but we're going to be taking further steps to improve the consistency and discipline of our approach to asset management across all our international teams going forward.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll be taking a highly selective approach to new investments and considering each one in the context of a broader capital allocation policy, as well as implementing an annual vintage control policy for 3i balance sheet investments, while being consistent with our ongoing fund commitments.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've redesigned the investment review processes around management assessment, as well as improving the way we monitor and we track our existing investments.",572
18511,"2012m6","In particular, we are changing the way we assess chief executives and senior board members of portfolio companies.",572
18511,"2012m6","From now on, the 3i Investment Committee will be involved in all chief executive appointments as opposed to leaving these key decisions to the investment teams in the field.",572
18511,"2012m6","Since I joined in October last year, I've been working closely with the management of the Private Equity division, and we've been reviewing our investment approach and our asset management approach.",572
18511,"2012m6","We have 6 major initiatives underway now, which in time will make a crucial difference to our current portfolio of 90 Private Equity investments, as well as future investments.",572
18511,"2012m6","These 6 improvements will be implemented over the balance of the year and completed by November.",572
18511,"2012m6","On costs, 3i became a very fat organization at the peak in the 2008 financial year with operating cost of GBP 290 million.",572
18511,"2012m6","Over the last 4 years, these costs have been reduced to some GBP 180 million as was reported in March, and I plan to take them down further this year.",572
18511,"2012m6","I’ve spent the last 6 weeks leading a review of our costs with our business line and function heads.",572
18511,"2012m6","There've been no sacred cows in this review, and we've worked hard to figure out exactly what infrastructure we need for our new slimmed-down network.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll be taking out over 160 employees from our total staff of 435 at the end of March.",572
18511,"2012m6","Departures are starting immediately with the bulk of staff leaving by the end of September.",572
18511,"2012m6","The reduction will be completed by the end of March next year.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll also be making important savings in property cost and in travel, as well as reducing head office staff and restructuring our IT and our finance functions.",572
18511,"2012m6","These moves will result in annualized run rate cost savings of GBP 40 million by March 2013 as you can see in the green box and a total of GBP 45 million by March 2014.",572
18511,"2012m6","There'll be one-off implementation costs of about GBP 30 million which together with timing effects, results in actual reported costs for our financial year 2013 being probably at about a similar level for 2012.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're aiming to cover our operating expenses by our cash income by March 2014, something 3i has not done for a very long time.",572
18511,"2012m6","These numbers could be amended for the Debt Management acquisition in contemplation, but we're still aiming to cover our income -- to use our income to cover our costs by that date.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're also planning to reduce the group's gross debt to save on our gross annual interest bill of GBP 103 million, which is a straight drag on shareholder returns.",572
18511,"2012m6","Over time, we hope to fundamentally change our capital allocations policy.",572
18511,"2012m6","We'll get away from using capital to pay for operating costs, interest and debt repayments so that we have the scope for shareholder distributions and higher levels of reinvestment.",572
18511,"2012m6","We will do that by reducing our operating costs and our interest bill.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're also focused on growing income from our portfolio, as well as increasing third-party income.",572
18511,"2012m6","The group announced a rebased dividend in November last year, and we defined the basis for shareholder distributions at 15% to 20% of gross cash proceeds.",572
18511,"2012m6","The immediate priority is to bring down gross debt below GBP 1 billion and to remain below 20% gearing.",572
18511,"2012m6","I'm pleased to say that we're well on the way to the GBP 1 billion target already.",572
18511,"2012m6","So I have the benefit of being a close observer of 3i over a long period of time and of having the chance to study the organization from inside during the last 6 months.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've now got a clear and more realistic strategy and a vision of where we're headed.",572
18511,"2012m6","The remaining team is very focused on delivering value to our shareholders and our limited partners.",572
18511,"2012m6","The financial year 2013 will be a transitional year of restructuring, focusing the network and significantly reducing our operating and our funding costs, as well as tackling our investment and asset management processes.",572
18511,"2012m6","We're operating in a challenging macro environment, but our portfolio is actually maturing well, and we expect a building level of realizations as we enter 2013.",572
18511,"2012m6","And that will mean that our shareholders will have a direct participation in those realizations.",572
18511,"2012m6","And finally, we plan to use our corporate calendar going forward to keep you informed about our progress in hitting the key milestones that I've just laid out.",572
18511,"2012m6","Now before I close, I would just like to leave you with a couple of thoughts.",572
18511,"2012m6","We've got a clear vision of where we aim to take 3i, and I'm excited about this challenge.",572
18511,"2012m6","Over my career, I've worked with a lot of Britain's best companies, and it's clear to me that there are a few special things that underpin strong businesses: a clear vision that guides an ambitious but realistic strategy; integrity and respect for individuals, whether they'd be colleagues, customers or suppliers; high-energy levels and a good work ethic; and clear decisions based on thorough analysis followed by rapid follow-through.",572
18511,"2012m6","These values have served me well through my career, and I'm sure they'll be central to bringing 3i back to the top of its game.",572
18511,"2012m6","In my book, that means everybody at 3i has got to demonstrate our investing and asset management skills to our shareholders and our limited partners.",572
18511,"2012m6","Thanks for your time, and we're happy to take Q&A now.",572
18511,"2012m6","Chris [ph] Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",572
18511,"2012m6","Simon, obviously, you sent a pretty positive signal to the market by investing a substantial amount in 3i shares.",572
18511,"2012m6","What are your thoughts going forward about how you can improve the alignment of interest between the other executives working at 3i and shareholders? The top quartile cash returns, I think our view would be if you look at mid-market investing, and you're targeting 2 to 2.",572
18511,"2012m6","5x of the cash return in the investment, that will put you up into the top quartile.",572
18511,"2012m6","So that is the type of ambition that we have for the more recent crop of investments and the investments going forward.",572
18511,"2012m6","In terms of the gross debt, our ambition is to take that down lower than GBP 1 billion, but perhaps Julia can comment on that.",572
18511,"2012m6","It's Henry Freeman from Investec.",572
18511,"2012m6","The Brazil office obviously is staying open, and you're focusing new investment in Private Equity in Northern Europe and Brazil.",572
18511,"2012m6","Brazil seems slightly odd considering you're coming out of other emerging markets.",572
18511,"2012m6","Is it because it's such a new office that you don't feel the time is right to cut that? Or is it just because you're seeing such great investment opportunities, which I'd be interested in considering a lot of commentators are saying Brazil is actually becoming pretty overpriced now? I think they'll be an absolute amount.",572
18511,"2012m6","We haven't defined what it is because we're in a very -- a relatively low investment year, but I think over the autumn, we're going to look at what we think is what I would term a par rate of investment for the group and its 3 businesses and then for each business, look at a vintage level.",572
18511,"2012m6","So a percentage above that level that we might be prepared to invest to.",572
18511,"2012m6","So that we won't be doubling or tripling investment in years going forward.",572
18511,"2012m6","Well, I was at the Buyout Conference last week, and I've met many of the LPs.",572
18511,"2012m6","They're clearly disappointed with the performance of that fund, but they're also -- they've been multiple investors across many of 3i's funds, and that is the first hollow they've been.",572
18511,"2012m6","All the predecessors have been very strong funds, so they're setting it in that context.",572
18511,"2012m6","There's a lot of goodwill still out there to 3i, and they would like to see 3i recover, but a great deal of frustration about what's happened in that particular fund.",572
18511,"2012m6","So I mean, realistically, we have to take that back above cost and get us far above cost as we can, and we have to start sending cash back before we can realize -- really go back with our cap out to raise more money.",572
18511,"2012m6","And I think quite a number of the investments in that fund are maturing with a view to being realized in 2013 and beyond.",572
18511,"2012m6","So -- and there's a nice mixture of some of the more recent investments which are very strong, and some of the old investments which are now under control and are coming to the point where they can be sold.",572
18511,"2012m6","And perhaps as a follow-up, in terms of the returns on your fund and clearly, that's disappointed thus far, I mean, how long do you think it will take to recover the relationships with the LPs to realistically think about launching a fund? I mean, and what sort of -- what are the steps towards that? Is it getting to 1.",572
18511,"2012m6","5x? I mean, how should we think about that process? Philip Middleton, Merrill.",572
18511,"2012m6","You've talked about how you're thinking about recruiting people with an operational background in the investing side.",572
18511,"2012m6","Are there any other areas where you're looking to recruit, in particular, if you have got ambitions in the asset gathering area? Presumably, that's an area you might want -- you might need to bulk up in as well.",572
18511,"2012m6","It's Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",572
18511,"2012m6","I was wondering if you'd talk a bit about the shape of the investment teams going forward.",572
18511,"2012m6","There's obviously going to be a lot of change geographically.",572
18511,"2012m6","Should we assume that there'll be little change to the Infrastructure and Debt side? And on the Private Equity side, how will that be organized going forward? Will it be on industry sectors? And what sort of change do you anticipate in the number of investment executives? Yes.",572
18511,"2012m6","I mean, we've first set the target for GBP 1 billion for the immediate term.",572
18511,"2012m6","Clearly, we don't have to look at what we have left, and we will take opportunities as we can.",572
18511,"2012m6","And as realizations come through, that will give us more opportunity.",572
18511,"2012m6","Ultimately, we think that we shouldn't have any significant amount of debt at the top-level company, but I do have the benefit of some very long dated sterling bonds, and so it's just working out the best route to bring that down further.",572
18511,"2013m11","I think in terms of we're not contemplating any new areas at the moment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're sticking to the 3 activities that we have.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In terms of Infrastructure, we're very keen to see a doubling of the scale of that business in terms of funds under management, over the planned period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we've also set a revenue target for the Debt Management business to get to GBP 50 million of fees in that business over the planned period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So there aren't a really 2 targets that we have for these businesses.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So you will have seen in the numbers that the carry payable for the period is higher than it's in the past and actively that's a good signal.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've talked about improvement in the performance of 2010 plus I guess a particular.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And what we're seeing in the first half easy catch capture of some of our carry schemes payable have gone through some performance hurdles.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So to be clear, when we account for our carry, effectively what we do is we assume that we have realize the whole portfolio of the current carrying value and then calculate the carry based on that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It isn't the same as the carry actually been paid because the carry paid us to delivers when the realizations have actually come through.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But her some Element of catch up in the carry charge in this first half because the strong performance that you've mentioned Eurofund V, particularly in those other bit of vintages is taken from some of the schemes for the hurdle.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So the carry payable you'll see going forward is now much more a function of not just realized profits, but the unrealized value growth as well because that's the accrual that's coming through.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think on the earnings disclosure I gave you, that show indeed the number of company's it's also showing you the value attribute to those.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the ones that have got the poorer performance, the recent reduced earnings growth, in terms of where does it go from here there's always good to be the caveat of some performance will be at risk in those also who source of companies.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But the focus that we have on managing these on a regular basis with the monthly dashboard mitigate that to a certain extent.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the valuation methodology also mitigated so to a certain extent because we will use forecast earnings for the current year earnings if we can see those earnings are going down.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And I showed you an do it on earlier slide the number of companies that we've got provided of that base to put some risk buffer into the valuation that comes from those.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But we still have 87 assets in the Private Equity portfolio, the top 25 or 75% of the value but that's quite a long tail at the end some of the more trickier assets that were trying to work out.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Danny Garrod from Barclays.",1010
18511,"2013m11","First question on your hedging policy.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Obviously, you've highlighted clearly that FX has had a negative impact on this NAV.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Has there been sort of material over the last 12, 18 months production in how much you hedged the exposures? And given sort of expectations of perhaps currency instability remaining for some time that you're convinced that sort of reduced hedge exposure is the right way to go.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Are there any plans to increase it again back up if that was the case? Second question is around sort of India exposures that you highlighted as well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You have always a pretty signaled no new Infrastructure investments in India, but could you remind us about what you're exposures overall currently stand at in terms of the people, portfolio and the Infrastructure and what do you sort of plans there are there any plans are sort of a separate exits to sort of reduced that? Good morning, everyone.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Sorry to pull the blinds down and stop you looking at the window, but we do want your attention in the presentation.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Welcome to 3i's interim results.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've had a good first half with solid results on the back of a major restructuring last year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're now generating some real momentum in the business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've produced an excellent run of realizations.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our portfolio is performing well in what remains a tricky macro environment across Europe, and our network of international offices is delivering interesting deal flow away from aggressive and competitive auction processes.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our operating costs are down and our debt is down, and we are dealing with the group's bold leakages more quickly than we had originally planned.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're also seeing a very strong recovery in the performance of our 2 Private Equity funds, Eurofund V and the Great Capital Fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This morning, I'd like to talk to you about our strategic objectives and our progress so far and our evolving business model.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Then I'll hand over to Julia who will take you through our financial performance in the first half.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Now I'd like to start by reminding you about our strategy.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's simple and it includes all 3 of 3i's businesses: Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The combination of our complementary asset management capabilities across these 3 platforms, together with our permanent capital, gives our investors a clearly differentiated and attractive value proposition.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our 3 businesses are each different in terms of what drives them as well as the returns they deliver.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They complement each other, and together they are capable of providing an interesting balance of both income and capital returns.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You've seen this before.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The 3i Value Build.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the results for this year are confirming each and every step on this slide.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our multi-year value build is based on a number of different phases of organizational stringent strategic delivery.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have delivered all of the strategic priorities we set for our financial year 2013 and we're already progressing well in transition and delivery, the next phase of our plan.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our priorities for this year are clear: Continue making realizations and to realize fully the benefits from the Private Equity management initiatives; look for new investments in Private Equity using proprietary capital and third-party co-investment; and continue to grow Debt Management and the Infrastructure third-party businesses.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We will also reduce our operating and funding costs even further, and we've already fully implemented on new compensation arrangements across the group.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The momentum from our exit plans has continued into the current year as you can see, so we've generated very good value uplifts, 32% over the March valuations.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've not only been selling some recent investments, we've also been spending time tidying up the trickier end of our portfolio with the goal of reducing the portfolio size and making it more manageable.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As I told you before when I review of our Private Equity portfolio, I think about it in 4 buckets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's been great to see the material growth in value in bucket 1 over the last 16 months, as well as the consistent realization of bucket 2 assets at good multiples.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we continue to focus on the trickier assets in buckets 3 and 4.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This takes time but will result in a rightsized and more manageable portfolio.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's also been pretty satisfying to see a good flow of new investment opportunities coming through our international offices.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have made 3 very attractive investments in the last few months after looking at a good number of opportunities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","These are businesses where we have relevant experience and where we have bought them away from the highly competitive auction processes I mentioned a minute ago.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That way, we avoided the heavy premiums being paid across the market at the moment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As far as I am concerned, the price we pay for something is likely to be the major determinant of our return on it.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So while I'm not looking to buy cheap assets, I certainly don't expect the PE team to bring the proposals that are priced to perfection as a result of some aggressive auction process.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I would rather be patient than lay down assets with the wrong entry price, and that's particularly true with the economic uncertainties we all still face at this time.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The investing teams in 3i charged with finding and managing investments, as well as ultimately selling them for a solid return.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But it's the Investment Committee which takes all material decisions around new investment, around financing, key people changes and around exits, as well as acting as an Engaged LP in monitoring the portfolio on a monthly basis.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This committee, which I chair, is made up of a majority of individuals outside of the Private Equity investment team, and enacts completely independently as a custodian of the group's proprietary capital.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Now turning to Infrastructure.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The division continue to make a good contribution to the group's cash income, and the European portfolio continues to perform well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But we saw a significant pullback in the valuations of some of our Indian assets, not least because of the challenging of overall economic conditions in India and the depreciating rupee.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And Julie will talk more about foreign exchange in a minute.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've made strong progress in growing the Infrastructure business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Earlier this week, we completed our acquisition of Barclays Infrastructure Fund Management business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That acquisition is a significant milestone in the implementation of our strategy.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It adds a further $780 million of our third-party AUM.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The team based in London and Paris currently manages 2 active funds in U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","and European PPP and energy projects, so it clearly complements 3i's existing European Infrastructure product offering which focuses on core infrastructure.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I have met and spent time with this team.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They are busy, focused people and they will double our investment capacity in Infrastructure, and we intend to leverage our enhanced platform to raise new third-party Infrastructure funds.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're also growing our Debt Management business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've recently completed our first new CLO issue in Europe, and we're seeing good opportunities in the U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","to launch further CLOs, through the Fraser & Sullivan platform we acquired last year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As you can see, we have set the team some demanding strategic objectives, but the business has a very experienced group of credit professionals running it and is well placed to build further in this changing sector.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As a result of our cost saving progress up to March 2013, we announced in May a material increase in our cost reduction targets for this current financial year to March '14.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've moved our total cost reduction target up to GBP 60 million from the original GBP 45 million we announced in June '12.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That represents a like-for-like reduction of almost 1/3 of the total cost base of GBP 185 million that we started with the March 2012.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As the benefits of the changes we've already implemented take effect and we continue to manage the business tightly, we will see further reductions.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We will be keeping pressure on driving down costs, at the same time that we're making sure that we have the right platform and the right level of support to grow our Infrastructure and Debt Management businesses and to maintain the momentum in our Private Equity business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we've delivered another material win on our balance sheet.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As you can see, gross debt is now down to GBP 873 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we closed the first half with net cash of GBP 28 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We fully implemented our new compensation arrangements, including more share-based compensation to senior staff.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This is already having a strong impact across the business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","People are much more focused on costs and as a result, our cost base is much more in line with the more efficient companies in our sector.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's good to see senior staff acting with the same discipline on costs as an owner would.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That means the interest of both our shareholders and our investors are closely aligned.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're already making strong progress in the current phase of our strategic plan transition and delivery.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The slide shows our key objectives for this year and next.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We are coming from a long way back, but we're making good progress in costs and generating new income.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're seeing growth in Debt Management and Infrastructure leading to a more balanced contribution across our 3 businesses to third-party fee income.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're seeing a material shift in capital allocation as we have reduced our costs and our debt.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And as we build third-party AUM, more of our cash is going to reinvestment and to shareholder distributions.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This financial year, we've already met our goals for gearing of less than 20% and gross debt below GBP 1 billion.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And as a result, we intend to propose a total dividend in financial year '14 of 20p per share.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That 20p will include the base dividend of  8.",1010
18511,"2013m11","1p per share.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We expect a lower level of realization activity in the second half, but we expect the balance of further realizations and new investment to support our proposed 20p distribution.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This is a very big change from 18 months ago.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And as a shareholder in the group, I am delighted with this development.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's been a real team effort and I would like to offer my thanks to each and everyone of 3i's team.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They've been doing a great job.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Now I'd like to talk to you about 3i's evolving business model.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This is 3i's business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's distinctive because of the scale of our proprietary capital that is invested in mid-market private equity.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our proprietary capital invested alongside LP funds will provide significant upside for the shareholders once we have remove all the unnecessary leakages which the group has suffered from in the past.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think we've now achieved the right alignment of interest across the group.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We continue to put the group's own capital to work alongside third-party investors, and we've now become a much more proactive owner and manager of our portfolio assets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And importantly, the senior and investing objectives in the group now receive a significant proportion of 3i Group shares as part of their variable compensation.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They're also being measured in operational effectiveness, as well as their investment performance.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our clear objective's to both to maximize investment returns on the group's own investments and grow profitably our fund management business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We will deliver this through the 3i Value Build.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This slide clearly shows the different contributions of our businesses between proprietary and third-party capital.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The Private Equity portfolio accounts for the bulk of that proprietary capital, while Debt Management is the largest contributor to third-party AUM and fees.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So we are now managing the group with much clearer delineation between proprietary capital investing and our fund management activities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Going forward, you'll be able to track our progress through different KPIs measuring our performance at 3i Group in our usage of proprietary capital and through our fund management activities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have a clear targets generating annual income, profits and capital flows that we can use for shareholder returns and for reinvestment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The first phase of our turnaround plan has gone very well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I'm particularly pleased by our progress on realizations and the quality of the recent investments in Private Equity.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And as I said earlier, we have a new set of priorities for the current financial year and we've made a good start in meeting these new challenges.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Now I'd like to close by making one final point.",1010
18511,"2013m11","There continues to be a great deal of focus on our NAV as the appropriate proxy for our share price.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But as some of you know, I don't hold with that view.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I believe NAV is a measure which has more relevance for a company or trust that owns listed securities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The bulk of our proprietary capital, and we have a lot, is invested in mid-market private equity investments, where we are planning to generate real alpha by making at least 2x return on our costs.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But we can't describe the target return to our core revaluations because these are illiquid private company holdings, and business plans for these investments are only partially executed.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This leads us to be cautious in our valuations at any particular point in time as our average EBITDA multiple and the premium on the recent realizations would indicate.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our experience over the past 12 months has been that we can obtain significant premier to our book values if we sell assets at the right time i.",1010
18511,"2013m11","the culmination of our exit plans into the supportive financing market and where financial or trade buyers are prepared to pay a premium to win an asset.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We held our Private Equity Investor Day in September focusing on Action and Element in order to communicate and potential quality and value growth in our key per bucket assets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","These are assets, which have much rather potential than 2x.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In the case of Action, there are several high-growth discount stocks listed in Europe and North America with similar growth rates to Action but none of them trade at 10x EBITDA as we value our stake in Action today.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The same is true for Element, in that we are only partway through our plan for Element, so we value our stake at a discount to the listed peers, even though the peers are growing much less strongly.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So when people think about our NAV being a useful proxy for 3i's share price, they should remember that it doesn't reflect either the complete execution of our exit plans or the premium that can come from selling an asset well at the right time, or for that matter the potential value in our fund management platform.",1010
18511,"2013m11","None of this, of course, missed that valuations cannot go down, as well as up, but that's true of listed stocks as well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Okay, enough for me.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I'll hand over to Julia.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Okay, what I suggest Julia take the hedging question.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And I'll make some comments about India.",1010
18511,"2013m11","On those assets or those challenged assets, we have changed 13 of the CEOs in those buckets sponges, so we are very aggressively focusing on those buckets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They can't avoid the macros some of those companies and despite what we're reading the papers and everything else, it's still a low flow tricky macro for many medium-sized businesses out there.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the ones that tend to be vulnerable for that tend our bucket 3.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So we're putting a lot of effort into getting our cost that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're getting near to our cost to have a couple of tries recently witnessed one was best invest, which bordered their papers at the peak of the market then the other Everest the consultant consultancy in Spain which NTT has purchased.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I mean, we're getting some good breaks in that bucket but we can avoid the macro.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The macro is tough for some of these companies.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In terms of Eurofund V performance, again, what is interesting is inbound and we've started to get LPs asking us when we're going to raise our next fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They're getting very excited about a turnaround.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think there's much more material turnaround to come so having taken it from 0.",1010
18511,"2013m11","63 to 1, still a lot more to come in that fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think it will have are respectable outcome, very much, driven by the latter investments who the end of 2010 to the end of the fund type investments is we are feeling very good about that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But we what those rest of the on the Board for when we start the next fund raising.",1010
18511,"2013m11","If there are no more questions, thanks for your attention.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Appreciate it.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think what we're planning to do is of our screws a bit more in that final results.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So it may not be the final, final version but it will be a lot more than you've received to date to the financial results.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You also made good progress in terms of growing funds under management debt and then structure oh are there any other sectors that you think you'd like to expand into? And on debt structure, do you have sort of aspirational targets as to where you'd like to get to in terms of funds under management, i.",1010
18511,"2013m11","the next few years? Tom Mills, KBW.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Using the Barclays Infrastructure team as a platform to grow you Infrastructure assets, what should we be thinking about in terms of the size of the potential raise if you were to do some of any kind of guidance you can give us on that? I mean, I would just on the observation on hedging this is an accounting adjustment not a cash adjustment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","When we get a receipt in from a euro realization, we don't change it into sterlings right away because we know that we're probably going to be banking on euro investment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So our actual real cash damage from an appreciation in sterling is far more modest than the translation number that appears in the account because we are actively managing our currencies and how we spend that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I would and get too carried away about the translation transition and this is the same for the dollar receipts.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The trickier element is India, which is the segue into that question.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have seen significant witness into the rupee.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The group has an exposure through 3iN its exposure in India.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Have an exposure directly to the 3i India Infrastructure fund while the first item when they became CEO is to turn of the fundraising for the second fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I feel very pleased about the decision.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we also have some small have equity investments in India that were made several years ago, so we're not committing any new capital to India, whether to the fund or through group directly.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And actually, the exposure to India, the cost of the decline in the rupee has become increasingly modest.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So that's hope we're getting towards the bottom.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The 1 reassurance we have these wild it investments are in a nearer not the highest quality I would say.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The Infrastructure investments in that mean there are pretty distant portfolio.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So we're just going to work those out in a patient way and hopefully recover our dollar cost over time.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Tom? It was fundraising.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Chase.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Just a couple of questions.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The new investments you've made post the period end, do you extent clear investment or were they all 3i's capital? Philip Middleton at Merrill.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I just wondered if you could say quickly.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You've obviously tied it up a lot about the costs and the balance sheet such that it's a tremendous hard work.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Going forward, returns will be driven by the investment teams and your ability to grow and nurture.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I wondered if you could said alluded about talent retention and recruitment? And also a bit about how you see the prospects for third-party fundraising over the next couple of years? From Morgan Stanley just a couple of questions if I can.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You mentioned the generation carry in the payables.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Just wanted to how should we think about a number the second half because it's quite so material in the first half? And then sort of into next year? And then in terms of the Private Equity portfolio, I guess the want to check those there was a slight wear it talked about the earnings growth some of the company's understood effectively 1 quarter of the company's though budget earnings declines are just wanted the show how should we think about a turnaround of those businesses either structurally challenged and and you wouldn't expect in recovery or how should we think about that? And so just a final question if I may, as following from that second one about the earnings growth.",1010
18511,"2013m11","How where would you expect your funds rate performance to be in 12 months time you also increased it dramatically realizations are slowing or you're signaling they're going to slow.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So how would you urge with the performance be in 12 months? Well, we haven't talked in detail about it, but they have 2 funds with GBP 780 million under management, say I would have thought you talk about 1/3 to 1/2 as an initial foray suppose that number if we're talking about a fundraise that will take place sometime over the next 18 months.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think on retention and talent recruitment, the industry -- the private equity industry in particular is still going through a very significant shakeup.",1010
18511,"2013m11","There are real winners and losers evolving because of the more difficult fundraising environment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And still relatively low Pro of transaction trafficking the broader M&A market.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think 3i is not a survivor in that because it's permanent capital and the contributions that come from the group, but it's actually going to be a winner in that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And I think that we now have a portfolio of investments, which are beginning to generate significant carry for the investments of the group.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So the investments that have principally been made since the beginning of '11 are very valuable collection of investments.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That is the time when the current Private Equity team came together.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They have been the alter of those investments since then.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I think they are glued pretty heavily into that set of investments because of the success of them, and that's what drive private equity investors.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I think we have a much less concerns about retention than we did before.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're also receiving 3i Group shares as part of their variable compensation.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Those shares have been doing very well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They will get the benefit of dividends that are made on those shares.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I think they will be rewarded in the same way that the shareholders are rewarded as the capital allocation policy changes.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In terms of new talent, we are beginning to see inbound costs from individuals who are talented but are perhaps in those firms were there is more of a question mark over those survivability and their future.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So that again is another indication of our status in a changing industry.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I think if we want to, we'll be in a position to obtain new talent.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I don't see us having many gaps across our core Northern European platform at the moment, that has to be said.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And I don't have any real concerns about losing executives that I want to keep us part of that team.",1010
18511,"2013m11","What was the third point, Philip? You've got a mic Do you want to take one and two and I'll take three? Yes, so actually the hedging story is quite a long one it's actually quite related to the strategy.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So when we decided to reduce gross debt, in effect, that was taking away one of the plans of the hedging strategy because our gross debt we try to get currency that which is actually a good tenure match for the portfolio.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I considerable time ago, 3i had many investments and there was a regular turnover of assets investments in realization flows with the idea of using derivative policy to match that was broadly effective.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As we've come down to smaller numbers of assets, and we've taken away the desire to have gross debt, the idea of trying to use portfolio of derivatives to hedge the assets just to be properly effective.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've got assets that are being held pursuant 3 to 5 years, and we've got a big focus now on cash and the liquidity trend that you can have another program is purely on risk, particularly in financial markets that we're seeing at the moment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So it in the most important strategic point is that we are focused on our cash-to-cash returns from our investments.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So Simon talked about the 2x target, and that is really what we're focused on.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So this interim accounting valuations that we have don't really go to that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And but running the risk of having a significant liquidity drain associated with the derivative program seem to be risk that is really giving us the right degree of reward.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So it has been, particularly volatile in these 6-month period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've got the closing assets and the derivatives program going as well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But I think that it's something that we will continues to be under review.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Again the role of rule of thumb type of it degree of caveats dependent on the makeup of the portfolio that investment centralization flows but roughly speaking, a 1% move in the euro is about a GBP 10 million movement, and a 1% movement in the dollar is about GBP 7 million movement.",1010
18511,"2013m11","and that's roughly end up in the 6-month period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the other question is when you did the spin of the profitability of the business? Yes, I thought yes.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're obviously very keen that we build a vintage of investments under this new team from the beginning of '11.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And I think LPs need to see that team, not only making investments and managing them but realizing them as well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So my judgment is we're somewhere away in launching a new private equity fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I don't think it will happen this year and I don't think it will happen in the next financial year, but it could well happen the year after that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But I'm not seeing it much earlier than that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They were a mixture, so Scandlines was a Eurofund V funded investments.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So that was made for the funds so that was 3i's money and Eurofund V money.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It was a proprietary capital investment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And JMJ was made with one of our managed account co-invested relationships, so a mixture.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So the results we've announced this morning provide another stating point and more evidence that we're delivering on our strategic priorities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As Simon has said, we now have a much stronger financial and strategic platform for the business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've achieved strong realizations with good uplift over opening values.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've also continued to see stability in the portfolio as well as a much better balance of our costs in our income.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have reduced our gross debt further and interest costs even further, and have announced an interim special dividend of 4p.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This is a solid set of results on just about every measure as you can see here.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We generated a gross portfolio return of GBP 315 million through strong realizations as an uplift of 32% to opening book, and we've made good progress on portfolio values.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I'll come back and talk more about that in a minute.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You can see clearly the benefits of the cost reductions implemented last year in the actual costs of the period of GBP 68 million and that compares to GBP 105 million in the same period last year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Both cash portfolio income and fee income have held up well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the cash investment of GBP 81 million reflects the increasing capital we've allocated to our Debt Management business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The new Private Equity deals we announced recently committing about GBP 185 million are not included in this period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our strong realizations and relatively low levels of investment mean that we have net cash and no gearing at the end of the period, so the Board has decided to give its guidance on a dividend for the year of 20p, and to declare today, the interim base and special dividend of 6.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The NAV we're reporting of 322p is before these dividend payments and as you can see in this slide, our cash returns have been a principal dock driver of growth in the first half.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You can also see the effect of noncash accounting items especially the foreign exchange impacts in the second quarter.",1010
18511,"2013m11","One of the key objectives for this strategic phase of transition and delivery was to cover our operating costs with our income, and we are making good progress in meeting our target of achieving this on a run-rate basis by the end of this financial year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Operating cash profit is positive in the first half and we've made progress on both sides of the equation.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We are benefiting in this half from some GBP 4 million of one-off portfolio income on exits, and we know we have on fees in the European Private Equity business because good realizations now reduce fee income.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But our cash fee income in the period of GBP 39 million is higher than the GBP 35 million in the same period last year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This slide shows the benefits of our U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","acquisition and Debt Management.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have raised almost $1 billion of new AUM in the U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","since last November, as well as generating good fees in the European business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the progress is actually better than it appears here, because we've replaced GBP 4 million of catch-up fees last year with GBP 4 million of new fund on recurring fees this year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And of course, the effect of the recently completed BIFM acquisition in Infrastructure will start to come through in the second half.",1010
18511,"2013m11","On the cost side of the equation we continue to make excellent progress, and we expect to exceed our revised cost reduction targets of GBP 60 million of savings by the end of this financial year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We said it would take a further GBP 7 million of implementation costs to get there, and we've reflected GBP 4 million of those in the first half.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've also made more progress to reduce costs associated with the balance sheet.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've achieved the target of reducing our gross debt to below GBP 1 billion in April, and the balance now stands at GBP 873 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And you can see the benefits of these in the gross interest charge for the period of GBP 28 million, the interest charge in the first half was GBP 62 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In the short term, however, we're not planning any more significant changes to bring the debt down further, and you can see here what the gross debt this made up of.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our public bonus which mature in 2017, 2023 and 2032.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we keep those positions under review but they are fully priced.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we do have a small residual portfolio of derivatives, which we're progressively closing down.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Their mark-to-market position is included in the gross debt number.",1010
18511,"2013m11","One negative in the results case especially in the second quarter has been the effects of sterling strength on the accounting translation of the balance sheet.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So this slide shows you the currency makeup of our net assets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It also gives you the breakdown on how movements against sterling in the dollar and rupee in particular have contributed to the GBP 79 million translation loss in the period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Now, as I'm sure you're all aware, currency markets remain volatile, but we remain focused on cash-to-cash returns rather than periodic translations.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I'd now like to take you through some more detail on each of our 3 businesses: Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Private Equity has had another strong result supported by good realizations and portfolio performance.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Infrastructure continues to make an important contribution to our annual cash operating profit.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As thus, Debt Management's growth in AUM.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So taking Infrastructure first.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Stable fee income and reduce operating cost base have improved the operational performance of the Infrastructure business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The European portfolio has supported good performance at 3i Infrastructure plc, and our 34% holding has provided portfolio income of GBP 11 million in the period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I've talked about the currency effect of the Indian rupee, but the Indian Infrastructure fund asset valuations also reflects some specific operational and financing issues, and the direct holding in India fund gave way to a net unrealized value reduction of GBP 24 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our recently completed platform acquisition is an important development, and it will increase AUM by a further GBP 780 million and be added to the GBP 1.",1010
18511,"2013m11","5 billion seen here.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The combined fee will be even better place for fundraising.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Almost all of the capital invested the group in the first half has been to support the development of the Debt Management business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The team launched Harvest VII, which is the first new European CLO issued since the inception of the business in 3i, and momentum continues.",1010
18511,"2013m11","With 3i providing capital for U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","and European warehouses in the expectation of more CLOs to come.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This, together with the Fraser Sullivan acquisition last year, has resulted in an increase of more than 40% of AUM in the last 12 months.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This business supports the improvements in our annual cash operating profit, and it has delivered a net return of 12.",1010
18511,"2013m11","5% in the period before GBP 8 million of acquisition accounting adjustments.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Simon said the Private Equity business that drives the proprietary capital returns.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Strong realizations of GBP 528 million had an uplift of 32% over March 2013 values and an average cash-to-cash money multiple of 1.",1010
18511,"2013m11","6x show you the improving quality of the portfolio and, of course, supports our dividend policy.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Investments in the period was low with no new investments, but the pipeline is much stronger and our recently announced investments in GIF, JMJ and Scandlines are positive developments, accounting for about GBP 185 million of 3i's capital.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I'm not going to take you through portfolio and valuations, but it is also worth noting that significant contribution to marked improvement in net return shown here is also the reduction in the cost base.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We look at the Private Equity portfolio by region, by sector and by vintage.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The strong performance of the post 2010 investments has also improved the diversity of the vintage exposure, and we've realized significant number of assets from earlier years.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So another key development in the makeup of the portfolio is the number of assets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have said we'd like to reduce that over November and we've successfully reduced the number of assets in the Private Equity portfolio by 15 in the period from 102 to 87.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The top 25 now represent over 75% of the value.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And you can see that most of these continue to show positive performance trajectory.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In turn, that underpins stability in valuations.",1010
18511,"2013m11","There has been plenty of discussion about some of our largest assets like Action and Element, but it's also worth noting the improvement in performance of GEKA, a 2013 vintage investment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","GEKA has been the subject of lots of focus in the monthly dashboard meetings and the value recovery is now almost back to cost.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Across the whole Private Equity portfolio, the maturity of our investments by value and by number are growing our earnings, as you can see here.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In fact, the strength of our larger assets has supported value weighted last 12 months' earnings growth of 15%.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You can also see indicators of better stability across the portfolio in a number of metrics here: Increased earnings especially in our larger assets; fewer companies valued using forecast earnings; a modest increase in leverage caused in part with the refinancing of Action; and the increase in multiples also reflects increased confidence in the portfolio performance.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In recent periods, some multiples have been held flat against increasing comparable sets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In this quarter, improved performance in a small number of companies has now lifted that cap as at the multiple is more in line with the market.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You can see the effect of that here in multiple movements of GBP 78 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Positive markets have also helped the quality portfolio, with increases in value in the U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","-based at investments quintiles and gain in particular.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The negative movement of GBP 11 million in the DCF category relates principally to Indian assets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the GBP 13 million loss on movement to imminent sale is on a small number of minority Private Equity assets that are facing performance challenges with largest component relating to the Asian portfolio.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But overall, this is a solid performance, with no new positions and good progression in earnings.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And of course, the valuations are underpinned by the strong uplift to value and realizations that we've achieved in the period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So before closing, I just wanted to deal with a more detailed points about the dividends that we declared today.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have said we intend to paid 20p in total for the year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In keeping with our previous convention, we've declared 1/3 of that today, with 2.",1010
18511,"2013m11","7p on accounted base and 4p as a special dividend.",1010
18511,"2013m11","My plan is that we pay a base dividend as a revenue reserves when we can, and that any special is paid after capital, and both dividends will be paid together in January 2014.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So as I've said at the start, we have produced another set of financials which provide clear evidence that we're delivering on our strategy successfully.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But it's not just interim results that I'm pleased with.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have also achieved strong realizations and a stable portfolio performance.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've made good progress towards achieving an annual operating cash profit, and we now have lower interest costs and no gearing at the period and.",1010
18511,"2013m11","All of these factors have led to the activation of our dividend policy, which is allowing our shareholders to participate very directly in the success of the business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As Simon said in his opening, the business now has real momentum.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So thank you.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we're now happy to take questions.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the other question is, is when will you intend to sort of split out the profitability of the aforementioned [ph] business? Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",1010
18511,"2013m11","First question on your hedging policy.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Obviously, you highlighted clearly that FX has had a negative impact on this NAV.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Has there been a sort of material over the last sort of 12, 18 months reduction in how much you hedged the exposures? And given sort of expectations of perhaps currency instability remaining for some time, you're convinced that sort of reduced hedge exposure is the right way to go.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Are there any plans to increase it back up again if that was the case? Second question is around sort of India exposures that you highlighted as well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You obviously pretty [ph] signaled no new Infrastructure investments in India.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But could you remind us about what you're exposures overall currently stand at in terms of the PE portfolio and the Infrastructure? And what are your sort of plans there? Are there any plans to sort of accelerate exits and reduce that? Well, we haven't talked in detail about it, but they have 2 funds with GBP 780 million under management.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I would have thought you were talking about 1/3 to 1/2 as an initial foray of that sort of number if we're talking about a fundraise and that will take place sometime over the next 18 months.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You've got a mic? Tom Mills, KBW.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Using the Barclays Infrastructure team as a platform to grow you Infrastructure assets, what should we be thinking about in terms of the size of a potential raise if you were to do on -- is there any kind of guidance you can give us on that? It's Philip Middleton at Merrill.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I just wonder if you could say quickly -- you've obviously tied it up a lot about the costs in the balance sheet and such that -- which have been tremendous hard work.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Going forward, returns will be driven by the investment teams and your ability to grow and nurture.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I just wonder if you could say a little bit about talent retention and recruitment, and also a bit about how you see the prospects for third-party fundraisings over the next couple of years.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think in terms of -- we're not contemplating any new areas at the moment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're sticking to the 3 activities that we have.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In terms of Infrastructure, we're very keen to see a doubling of the scale of that business in terms of funds under management over the planned period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we've also set a revenue target for the Debt Management business to get to GBP 50 million of fees in that business over the planned period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So they're really the 2 targets we have for those businesses.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It was fundraising.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You also made good progress in terms of the growing funds under management, debt and then structure.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Are there any other sectors that you think you'd like to expand into? And on the Infrastructure, do you have sort of aspirational targets as to where you'd like to get to in terms of funds under management, i.",1010
18511,"2013m11","the next few years? Yes, I thought I get asked that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're obviously very keen that we build a vintage of investments under this new team from the beginning of '11.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And I think LPs need to see that team not only making investments and managing them, but realizing them as well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So my judgment is we're somewhere away from launching a new private equity fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I don't think it will happen this year and I don't think it will happen on the next financial year, but it could well happen the year after that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But I'm not seeing it much earlier than that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Well, I suggest Julia take the hedging question, and I'll make some comments about India.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I've said [ph] that those bucket 3 assets, those challenged assets, the -- we have changed 13 of the CEOs in those buckets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So we are very aggressively focusing on those buckets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They can't avoid the macros, some of those companies.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And despite what we're all reading in the papers and everything else, it's still a low flow tricky macro for many medium-sized businesses out there.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the ones that tend to be vulnerable to that tend to sit in our bucket 3.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So we're putting a lot of effort into getting our cost back.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're getting near to our cost.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We had a couple of triumphs recently that we announced.",1010
18511,"2013m11","One was Bestinvest, which was boarded [ph] a very high price at the peak of the market.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the other, Everis, the consultancy in Spain, which NTT has purchased.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I mean, we are getting some good breaks in that bucket, but we can avoid the macro.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The macro is tough for some of these companies.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In terms of Eurofund V performance, again, what is interesting is inbound and we've started to get LPs asking us when we're going to raise our next fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They're all getting very excited about the turnaround.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think there's much more material turnaround to come.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So having taken it from although 0.",1010
18511,"2013m11","63 to 1, there's still a lot more to come in that fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think it will have a respectable outcome, very much driven by the latter investments, so the end of 2010 to the end of the fund type investments.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So we're feeling very good about that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But we what those runs to be on the board for when we start the next fundraising.",1010
18511,"2013m11","If there are no more questions, thanks for your attention.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Appreciate it.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So you will have seen in the numbers that the carry payable for the period is higher than it's been in the past.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And actually, that's a good signal.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've talked about improvement in the performance of 2010-plus vintages in particular.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And what we're seeing in the first half is a catch-up of some of our carry schemes payable have gone through some performance hurdles.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So to be clear, when we account for our carry, effectively, what we do is we assume that we have realized the whole portfolio at the current carrying value and then calculate the carry based on that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It isn't the same as the carry that's actually being paid, because the carry paid actually only delivers when the realizations have actually come through.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But there's an element of catch-up in the carry charge in this first half because the strong performance that you've mentioned, Eurofund V, particularly in those latter vintages has taken some of those schemes through the hurdle.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So the carry payable you'll see going forward is now much more a function of not just some realized profits, but the unrealized value growth as well because that's the accrual that's coming through.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think on the earnings disclosure I gave you, that's showing you the number of companies and it's also showing you the value attributed to those.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the ones that have got the poorer performance, the reducing earnings growth, in terms of where does it go from here, there's always got to be the caveat of some performance will be at risk in those sorts of companies.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But the focus that we have on managing these on a regular basis with the monthly dashboard mitigate that to a certain extent.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the valuation methodology also mitigated to a certain extent because we will use forecast earnings for the current year earnings if we can see those earnings are going down.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And I showed you on an earlier slide the number of companies that we've got valued on that basis.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So put some risk buffer into the valuation that comes from those.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But we still have 87 assets in the Private Equity portfolio.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The top 25 are 75% of the value, but that's quite a long tail at the end, some of the more trickier assets that were trying to work out.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I mean, I would just add the observation on hedging is -- yes, this is an accounting adjustment, not a cash adjustment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","When we get a receipt in from a euro realization, we don't change it into sterlings right away because we know that we're probably going to be banking a euro investment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So our actual real cash damage from an appreciation in sterling is far more modest than the translation number that appears in the account because we are actively managing our receipts of currencies and how we spend that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I wouldn't get too carried away about the translation, and this is same for dollar receipts.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The trickier element is India, which is the segue into that question.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have seen significant weakness in the rupee.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The group has an exposure through 3iN and its exposure in India.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Have an exposure directly to the 3i India Infrastructure fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","One of the first decisions I took when I became CEO was to turn off the fundraising for the second fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I feel very pleased about that decision.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we also have some small private equity investments in India that were made several years ago.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So we're not committing any new capital to India, whether through the fund or through group directly.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And actually, the exposure to India, the cost of the decline in the rupee has become increasingly modest.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So let's hope we're getting towards the bottom.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the one reassurance we have is while the PE investments are not of the highest quality, I would have to say, the Infrastructure investments in the main are a pretty decent portfolio.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So we're just going to work those out in a patient way and hopefully recover our dollar cost over time.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Tom? Yes, so actually, this -- the hedging story is quite a long one.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's actually quite related to the strategy.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So when we decided to reduce gross debt, in effect, that was taking away one of the planks of the hedging strategy because our gross debt -- we try to get currency debt, which is actually a good tenure match for the portfolio.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Quite a considerable time ago, 3i had many investments and there was a regular turnover of assets, investments and realization flows.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So the idea of using a derivative policy to match that was broadly effective.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As we've come down to smaller numbers of assets and we've taken away the desire to have gross debt, the idea of trying to use a portfolio of derivatives to hedge the assets just sees [ph] that it's properly effective.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've got assets that are being held for 3 to 5 years, and we've got a big focus now on cash and the liquidity drain that you can have from running a derivative program can be quite onerous in -- particularly in currency markets that we're seeing at the moment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I think the most important strategic point is that we are focused on our cash-to-cash returns from our investments.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So Simon has talked about the 2x target, and that is really what we're focused on.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So these interim accounting valuations that we have don't really go to that and -- but running the risk of having a significant liquidity drain associated with the derivative program seem to be a risk that wasn't really giving us the right degree of reward.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So it has been particularly volatile in this 6-month period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've got the closing assets and derivative program going as well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But I think it's something that we will continue to be funds [ph] under review.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think the rule of thumb, I've tried to get people and I give it with a degree of caveat because it's dependent on the makeup of the portfolio and the investment and realization flows.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But roughly speaking, a 1% move on the euro is about a GBP 10 million movement, and a 1% movement in the dollar is about GBP 7 million movement, and that's roughly actually worse that it has [ph] been in this 6-month period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think what we're planning to do is lift our skirts a bit more in that with the final results.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So it may not be the final, final version, but it will be a lot more than you've received to date at the financial results.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Chase.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Just a couple of questions.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The new investments you made post the period end, to what extent -- were they current investments or were they all 3i's capital? Okay.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think on retention and talent recruitment, the industry -- the private equity industry in particular is still going through a very significant shakeup.",1010
18511,"2013m11","There are real winners and losers evolving  because of the more difficult fundraising environment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And there's still a relatively low flow of transactions reflecting the broader M&A market.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think 3i is not a [ph] survivor in that because of its permanent capital and the contributions that come from group, but it's actually going to be a winner in that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And I think we now have a portfolio of investments which are beginning to generate significant carry for the investments executives.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So the investments that have principally been made since the beginning of '11 are a very valuable collection of investments.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That is the time when the current Private Equity team came together.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They have been the author of those investments since then.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I think they are glued pretty heavily into that set of investments because of the success of them, and that's what drives private equity investors.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I think we have much less concerns about retention that we did before.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They're also receiving 3i Group shares as part of their variable compensation.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Those shares have been doing very well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They will get the benefit of dividends that are made on those shares.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I think they will be rewarded in the same way that the shareholders are rewarded as the capital allocation policy changes.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In terms of new talent, we are beginning to see inbound costs [ph] from individuals who are talented but are perhaps in those firms where there is more of a question mark over their survivability and their future.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So that again is another indication of our status in a changing industry.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I think if we want to, we'll be in a position to obtain new talent.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I don't see us having many gaps across our core Northern European platform at the moment, it has to be said.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And I don't have any real concerns about losing executives that I want to keep as part of that team.",1010
18511,"2013m11","What was the third point, Philip? Thank you.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So the results we've announced this morning provide another stating point and more evidence that we're delivering on our strategic priorities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As Simon has said, we now have a much stronger financial and strategic platform for the business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've achieved strong realizations with good uplift over opening values.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've also continued to see stability in the portfolio, as well as a much better balance of our costs and our income.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have reduced our gross debt further and interest costs even further and have announced an interim special dividend of 4p.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This is a solid set of results on just about every measure as you can see here.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We generated a gross portfolio return of GBP 315 million through strong realizations as an uplift of 32% to opening book, and we've made good progress on portfolio values.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I'll come back and talk more about that in a minute.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You can see clearly the benefits of the cost reductions implemented last year in the actual costs of the period of GBP 68 million, and that compares to GBP 105 million in the same period last year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Both cash portfolio income and fee income have held up well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the cash investment of GBP 81 million reflects the increasing capital we've allocated to our Debt Management business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The new Private Equity deals we announced recently, committing about GBP 185 million, are not included in this period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our strong realizations and relatively low levels of investment mean that we have net cash and no gearing at the end of the period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So the board has decided to give its guidance on a dividend for the year of 20p and to declare today the interim base and special dividend of 6.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The NAV we're reporting of 322p is before these dividend payments.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And as you can see in this slide, our cash returns have been a principal dark [ph] driver of growth in the first half.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You can also see the effect of noncash accounting items, especially the foreign exchange impacts in the second quarter.",1010
18511,"2013m11","One of the key objectives for this strategic phase of transition and delivery was to cover our operating costs with our income, and we are making good progress in meeting our target of achieving this on a run-rate basis by the end of this financial year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Operating cash profit is positive in the first half, and we've made progress on both sides of the equation.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We are benefiting in this half from some GBP 4 million of one-off portfolio income on exits, and we know we have pressure on fees in the European Private Equity business because good realizations now reduce fee income.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But our cash fee income in the period of GBP 39 million is higher than the GBP 35 million in the same period last year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This slide shows the benefits of our U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","acquisition and Debt Management.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have raised almost $1 billion of new AUM in the U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","since last November, as well as generating good fees in the European business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the progress is actually better than appears here, because we've replaced GBP 4 million of catch-up fees last year with GBP 4 million of new fund and recurring fees this year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And of course, the effect of the recently completed BIFM acquisition in Infrastructure will start to come through in the second half.",1010
18511,"2013m11","On the cost side of the equation, we continue to make excellent progress, and we expect to exceed our revised cost reduction targets of GBP 60 million of savings by the end of this financial year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We said it would take a further GBP 7 million of implementation costs to get there, and we've reflected GBP 4 million of those in the first half.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've also made more progress to reduce costs associated with the balance sheet.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've achieved the target of reducing our gross debt to below GBP 1 billion in April, and the balance now stands at GBP 873 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And you can see the benefits of this in the gross interest charge for the period of GBP 28 million, the interest charge in the first half was GBP 62 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In the short term, however, we're not planning any more significant changes to bring the debt down further, and you can see here what the gross debt is made up of.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our public bonus, which mature in 2017, 2023 and 2032, and we keep those positions under review but they are fully priced.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we do have a small residual portfolio of derivatives which we're progressively closing down.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Their mark-to-market position is included in the gross debt number.",1010
18511,"2013m11","One negative in the results case, especially in the second quarter, has been the effects of sterling strength on the accounting translation of the balance sheet.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So this slide shows you the currency makeup of our net assets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It also gives you the breakdown of how movements against sterling in the dollar and rupee in particular have contributed to the GBP 79 million translation loss in the period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Now, as I'm sure you're all aware, currency markets remain volatile, but we remain focused on cash-to-cash returns rather than periodic translations.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I'd now like to take you through some more detail on each of our 3 businesses: Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Private Equity has had another strong result, supported by good realizations and portfolio performance.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Infrastructure continues to make an important contribution to our annual cash operating profit, as does Debt Management's growth in AUM.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So taking Infrastructure first.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Stable fee income and reduced operating cost base have improved the operational performance of the Infrastructure business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The European portfolio has supported good performance at 3i Infrastructure plc, and our 34% holding has provided portfolio income of GBP 11 million in the period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I've talked about the currency effect of the Indian rupee, but the Indian Infrastructure fund asset valuations also reflects some specific operational and financing issues, and the group's direct holding in India fund gave rise to a net unrealized value reduction of GBP 24 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our recently completed platform acquisition is an important development, and it will increase AUM by a further GBP 780 million and be added to the GBP 1.",1010
18511,"2013m11","5 billion seen here.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The combined team will be even better place for fundraising.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Almost all of the capital invested by the group in the first half has been to support the development of the Debt Management business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The team launched Harvest VII, which is their first new European CLO issued since the inception of the business in 3i, and momentum continues, with 3i providing capital for U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","and European warehouses in the expectation of more CLOs to come.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This, together with the Fraser Sullivan acquisition last year, has resulted in an increase of more than 40% of AUM in the last 12 months.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This business supports the improvements in our annual cash operating profit, and it has delivered a net return of 12.",1010
18511,"2013m11","5% in the period before GBP 8 million of acquisition accounting adjustments.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Simon has said the Private Equity business drives the proprietary capital returns.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Strong realizations of GBP 528 million had an uplift of 32% over March 2013 values, and an average cash-to-cash money multiple of 1.",1010
18511,"2013m11","6x show you the improving quality of the portfolio and of course, supports our dividend policy.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Investments in the period was low with no new investment, but the pipeline is much stronger and our recently announced investments in GIF, JMJ and Scandlines are positive developments, accounting for about GBP 185 million of 3i's capital.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I'm not going to take you through portfolio and valuations, but it is also worth noting that a significant contribution to the marked improvement in net return shown here is also the reduction in the cost base.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We look at the Private Equity portfolio by region, by sector and by vintage.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The strong performance of the post-2010 investments has also improved the diversity of the vintage exposure, and we've realized a significant number of assets from earlier years.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So another key development in the makeup of the portfolio is the number of assets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have said we'd like to reduce that overall number, and we've successfully reduced the number of assets in the Private Equity portfolio by 15 in the period from 102 to 87.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The top 25 now represent over 75% of the value.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And you can see that most of these continue to show a positive performance trajectory.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In turn, that underpins stability in valuations.",1010
18511,"2013m11","There has been plenty of discussion about some of our largest assets like Action and Element, but it's also worth noting the improvement in performance of GEKA, a 2013 vintage investment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","GEKA has been a subject of lots of focus in the monthly dashboard meetings and the value recovery is now almost back to cost.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Across the whole Private Equity portfolio, the majority of our investments, by value and by number, are growing their earnings, as you can see here.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In fact, the strength of our larger assets has supported value weighted last 12 months' earnings growth of 15%.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You can also see indicators of better stability across the portfolio in a number of metrics here: Increased earnings, especially in our larger assets; fewer companies valued using forecast earnings; a modest increase in leverage caused in part by the refinancing of Action; and the increase in multiples also reflects increased confidence in the portfolio performance.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In recent periods, some multiples have been held flat against increasing comparable sets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In this quarter, improved performance in a small number of companies has -- [ph] we've lifted that cap that's [ph] at a multiple that's more in line with the market.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And you can see the effect of that here in the multiple movements of GBP 78 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Positive markets have also helped the quality portfolio, with increases in value in the U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","-listed investments, Quintiles and GAIN in particular.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The negative movement of GBP 11 million in the DCF category relates principally to Indian assets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the GBP 13 million loss or movement to imminent sale is on a small number of minority Private Equity assets that are facing performance challenges, with the largest component relating to the Asian portfolio.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But overall, this is a solid performance, with no new provisions and good progression in earnings.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And of course, the valuations are underpinned by the strong uplifts to value in realizations that we've achieved in the period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So before closing, I just wanted to deal with a more detailed points about the dividends that we declared today.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have said we intend to paid 20p in total for the year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In keeping with our previous convention, we've declared 1/3 of that today, with 2.",1010
18511,"2013m11","7p on accounted base and 4p as a special dividend.",1010
18511,"2013m11","My plan is that we pay the base dividend as revenue reserves when we can and that any special is paid out to capital, and both dividends will be paid together in January 2014.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So as I've said at the start, we have produced another set of financials which provide clear evidence that we're delivering on our strategy successfully.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But it's not just the interim results that I'm pleased with.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have also achieved strong realizations and a stable portfolio performance.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've made good progress towards achieving an annual operating cash profit, and we now have lower interest costs and no gearing at the period end.",1010
18511,"2013m11","All of these factors have led to the activation of our dividend policy, which is allowing our shareholders to participate very directly in the success of the business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As Simon said in his opening, the business now has real momentum.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So thank you, and we're now happy to take questions.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Just a couple of questions, if I can.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You mentioned earlier that there's good generation and a sort of carry in the performance of these payables.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I just wanted to -- how should we think about that number in the second half because it's quite sort of material in the first half and then sort of into next year? And then in terms of the Private Equity portfolio, I just want to check, there's a slide there where you were talking about the earnings growth of some of the companies -- and there's sort of effectively 1/4 of the companies with double-digit earning declines.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I just wanted to -- how should we think about the turnaround of those businesses? Are they sort of structurally challenged and you wouldn't expect a recovery, or how should I think about that? And so just a final question, if I may.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Just following on from that second one about the earnings growth.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Where would you expect your funds' sort of performance to be in sort of 12 months' time? You've also increased it dramatically, but realizations are sort of slowing or you're signaling they're going to slow.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So how do you -- where should that performance turn to be in 12 months? They were a mixture, so Scandlines was a Eurofund V follow-on investment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So that was made through the funds, so it was 3i money and Eurofund V money.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It was a proprietary capital investment, and JMJ was made with one of our managed account co-investment relationships, so a mixture.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Good morning, everyone.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Sorry to pull the blinds down and stop you looking at the window, but we do want your attention on the presentation.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Welcome to 3i's interim results.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've had a good first half with solid results on the back of a major restructuring last year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're now generating some real momentum in the business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've produced an excellent run of realizations, our portfolio is performing well in what remains a tricky macro environment across Europe and our network of international offices is delivering interesting deal flow away from aggressive and competitive auction processes.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our operating costs are down and our debt is down, and we are dealing with the group's old leakages more quickly than we had originally planned.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're also seeing a very strong recovery in the performance of our 2 Private Equity funds, Eurofund V and the Growth Capital Fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This morning, I'd like to talk to you about our strategic objectives and our progress so far and our evolving business model.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Then I'll hand over to Julia who will take you through our financial performance in the first half.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Now I'd like to start by reminding you about our strategy.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's simple and it includes all 3 of 3i's businesses: Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The combination of our complementary asset management capabilities across these 3 platforms, together with our permanent capital, gives our investors a clearly differentiated and attractive value proposition.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our 3 businesses are each different in terms of what drives them, as well as the returns they deliver.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They complement each other and together, they're capable of providing an interesting balance of both income and capital returns.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You've seen this before, the 3i Value Build.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the results for this year are confirming each and every step on this slide.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our multi-year value build is based on a number of different phases of organizational change and strategic delivery.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've delivered all of the strategic priorities we set for our financial year 2013, and we're already progressing well in transition and delivery, the next phase of our plan.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our priorities for this year are clear: Continue making realizations and to realize fully the benefits from the Private Equity management initiatives, look for new investments in Private Equity using proprietary capital and third-party co-investment and continue to grow Debt Management and the Infrastructure third-party businesses.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We will also reduce our operating and funding costs even further, and we've already fully implemented our new compensation arrangements across the group.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The momentum from our exit plans has continued into the current year, as you can see, so we've generated very good value uplifts, 32% over the March valuations.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've not only been selling some decent investments, we've also been spending time tidying up the trickier end of our portfolio, with the goal of reducing the portfolio size and making it more manageable.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As I've told you before, when I review our Private Equity portfolio, I think about it in 4 buckets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's been great to see the material growth in value in bucket 1 over the last 16 months, as well as the consistent realization of bucket 2 assets at good multiples.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we continue to focus on the trickier assets in buckets 3 and 4.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This takes time, but result -- but will result in a right-sized and more manageable portfolio.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's also been pretty satisfying to see a good flow of new investment opportunities coming through our international offices.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have made 3 attractive investments in the last few months after looking at a good number of opportunities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","These are businesses where we have relevant experience and where we have bought them away from the highly competitive auction processes I mentioned a minute ago.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That way, we avoided the heavy premiums being paid across the market at the moment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As far as I am concerned, the price we pay for something is likely to be the major determinant of our return on it.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So while I'm not looking to buy cheap assets, I certainly don't expect the PE team to bring the proposals that are priced to perfection as a result of some aggressive auction process.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I would rather be patient than lay down assets with the wrong entry price, and that's particularly true with the economic uncertainties we all still face at this time.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The investing teams in 3i charged with finding and managing investments, as well as ultimately selling them for a solid return.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But it's the Investment Committee which takes all material decisions around new investment, around financing, key people changes and around exits, as well as acting as an engaged LP in monitoring the portfolio on a monthly basis.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This committee, which I chair, is made up of a majority of individuals outside of the Private Equity investment team and enacts completely independently as a custodian of the group's proprietary capital.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Now turning to Infrastructure.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The division continued to make a good contribution to the group's cash income, and the European portfolio continues to perform well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But we saw a significant pullback in the valuations of some of our Indian assets, not least because of the challenging of overall economic conditions in India and the depreciating rupee.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And Julia will talk more about foreign exchange in a minute.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've made strong progress in growing the Infrastructure business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Earlier this week, we completed our acquisition of Barclays Infrastructure Fund Management business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That acquisition is a significant milestone in the implementation of our strategy.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It adds a further $780 million to our third-party AUM.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The team based in London and Paris currently manages 2 active funds in U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","and European PPP and energy projects, so it clearly complements 3i's existing European Infrastructure product offering, which focuses on core infrastructure.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I have met and spent time with this team.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They are busy, focused people and they will double our investment capacity in Infrastructure, and we intend to leverage our enhanced platform to raise new third-party Infrastructure funds.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're also growing our Debt Management business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have recently completed our first new CLO issue in Europe, and we're seeing good opportunities in the U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","to launch further CLOs, through the Fraser and Sullivan platform we acquired last year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As you can see, we have set the team some demanding strategic objectives, but the business has a very experienced group of credit professionals running it and is well placed to build further in this changing sector.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As a result of our cost-saving progress up to March 2013, we announced in May a material increase in our cost reduction target for this current financial year to March '14.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've moved our total cost reduction target up to GBP 60 million from the original GBP 45 million we announced in June '12.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That represents a like-for-like reduction of almost 1/3 of the total cost base of GBP 185 million that we started with the March 2012.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As the benefits of the changes we've already implemented take effect and we continue to manage the business tightly, we will see further reductions.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We will be keeping pressure on driving down costs, at the same time that we're making sure that we have the right platform and the right level of support to grow our Infrastructure and Debt Management businesses and to maintain the momentum in our Private Equity business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we've delivered another material win on our balance sheet.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As you can see, gross debt is now down to GBP 873 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we closed the first half with net cash of GBP 28 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We fully implemented our new compensation arrangements, including more share-based compensation for senior staff.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This is already having a strong impact across the business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","People are much more focused on costs and as a result, our cost base is much more in line with the more efficient companies in our sector.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's good to see senior staff acting with the same discipline on costs as an owner would.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That means the interest of both our shareholders and our investors are closely aligned.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're already making strong progress in the current phase of our strategic plan transition and delivery.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The slide shows our key objectives for this year and next.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We are coming from a long way back, but we're making good progress in costs and generating new income.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're seeing growth in Debt Management and Infrastructure leading to a more balanced contribution across our 3 businesses to third-party fee income.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're seeing a material shift in capital allocation as we have reduced our costs and our debt.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And as we build third-party AUM, more of our cash is going to reinvestment and to shareholder distributions.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This financial year, we've already met our goals for gearing of less than 20% and gross debt below GBP 1 billion.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And as a result, we intend to propose a total dividend in financial year '14 of 20p per share.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That 20p will include the base dividend of 8.",1010
18511,"2013m11","1p per share.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We expect a lower level of realization activity in the second half, but we expect the balance of further realizations and new investment to support our proposed 20p distribution.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This is a very big change from 18 months ago.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And as a shareholder in the group, I am delighted with this development.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's been a real team effort, and I would like to offer my thanks to each and everyone of 3i's team.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They've been doing a great job.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Now I'd like to talk to you about 3i's evolving business model.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This is 3i's business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's distinctive because of the scale of our proprietary capital that is invested in mid-market private equity.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our proprietary capital invested alongside LP funds will provide significant upside for the shareholders once we have removed all the unnecessary leakages which the group has suffered from in the past.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think we've now achieved the right alignment of interest across the group.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We continue to put the group's own capital to work alongside third-party investors, and we've now become a much more proactive owner and manager of our portfolio of assets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And importantly, the senior and investing executives in the group now receive a significant proportion of 3i Group shares as part of their variable compensation.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They're also being measured in operational effectiveness, as well as their investment performance.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our clear objectives are both to maximize investment returns on the group's own investments and grow profitably our fund management business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We will deliver this through the 3i Value Build.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This slide clearly shows the different contributions of our businesses between proprietary and third-party capital.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The Private Equity portfolio accounts for the bulk of that proprietary capital, while Debt Management is the largest contributor to third-party AUM and fees.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So we are now managing the group with much clearer delineation between proprietary capital investing and our fund management activities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Going forward, you'll be able to track our progress through different KPIs measuring our performance at 3i Group in our usage of proprietary capital and through our fund management activities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have a clear target of generating annual income, profits and capital flows that we can use for shareholder returns and for reinvestment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The first phase of our turnaround plan has gone very well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I'm particularly pleased by our progress on realizations and the quality of the recent investments in Private Equity.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And as I said earlier, we have a new set of priorities for the current financial year and we've made a good start in meeting these new challenges.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Now I'd like to close by making one final point.",1010
18511,"2013m11","There continues to be a great deal of focus on our NAV as the appropriate proxy for our share price.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But as some of you know, I don't hold with that view.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I believe NAV is a measure which has more relevance for a company or trust that owns listed securities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The bulk of our proprietary capital, and we have a lot, is invested in mid-market private equity investments, where we are planning to generate real alpha by making at least 2x return on our cost.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But we can't describe the target return to our core [ph] revaluations because these are illiquid private company holdings, and business plans for these investments are only partially executed.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This leads us to be cautious in our valuations at any particular point in time as our average EBITDA multiple and the premium on our recent realizations would indicate.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our experience over the past 12 months has been that we can obtain significant premier to our book values if we sell assets at the right time, i.",1010
18511,"2013m11","at the culmination of our exit plans, into a supportive financing market and where financial or trade buyers are prepared to pay a premium to win an asset.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We held our Private Equity Investor Day in September, focusing on Action and Element in order to communicate the potential quality and value growth in our key per bucket assets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","These are assets, which have much rather potential than 2x.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In the case of Action, there are several high-growth discount stocks listed in Europe and North America with similar growth rates to Action, but none of them trade at 10x EBITDA as we value our stake in Action today.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The same is true for Element, in that we are only partway through our plan for Element, so we value our stake at a discount to the listed peers, even though the peers are growing much less strongly.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So when people think about our NAV being a useful proxy for 3i's share price, they should remember that it doesn't reflect either the complete execution of our exit plans or the premium that can come from selling an asset well at the right time or for that matter, the potential value in our fund management platform.",1010
18511,"2013m11","None of this, of course, means that valuations cannot go down, as well as up, but that's true of listed stocks as well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Okay, enough for me.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I'll hand over to Julia.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Do you want to take 1 and 2, and I'll take 3? Do you want to take 1 and 2, and I'll take 3? Thank you.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So the results we've announced this morning provide another stating point and more evidence that we're delivering on our strategic priorities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As Simon has said, we now have a much stronger financial and strategic platform for the business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've achieved strong realizations with good uplifts over opening values.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've also continued to see stability in the portfolio, as well as a much better balance of our costs and our income.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have reduced our gross debt further and interest costs even further and have announced an interim special dividend of 4p.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This is a solid set of results on just about every measure as you can see here.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We generated a gross portfolio return of GBP 315 million through strong realizations as an uplift of 32% to opening book, and we've made good progress on portfolio values.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I'll come back and talk more about that in a minute.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You can see clearly the benefits of the cost reductions implemented last year in the actual costs of the period of GBP 68 million, and that compares to GBP 105 million in the same period last year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Both cash portfolio income and fee income have held up well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the cash investment of GBP 81 million reflects the increasing capital we've allocated to our Debt Management business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The new Private Equity deals we announced recently, committing about GBP 185 million, are not included in this period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our strong realizations and relatively low levels of investment mean that we have net cash and no gearing at the end of the period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So the board has decided to give its guidance on a dividend for the year of 20p and to declare today the interim base and special dividend of 6.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The NAV we're reporting of 322p is before these dividend payments.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And as you can see in this slide, how our cash returns have been a principal dark driver of growth in the first half.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You can also see the effect of noncash accounting items, especially the foreign exchange impacts in the second quarter.",1010
18511,"2013m11","One of the key objectives for this strategic phase of transition and delivery was to cover our operating costs with our income, and we are making good progress in meeting our target of achieving this on a run-rate basis by the end of this financial year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Operating cash profit is positive in the first half, and we've made progress on both sides of the equation.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We are benefiting in this half from some GBP 4 million of one-off portfolio income on exits, and we know we have pressure on fees in the European Private Equity business because good realizations now reduce fee income.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But our cash fee income in the period of GBP 39 million is higher than the GBP 35 million in the same period last year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This slide shows the benefits of our U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","acquisition in Debt Management.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have raised almost $1 billion of new AUM in the U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","since last November, as well as generating good fees in the European business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the progress is actually better than appears here because we've replaced GBP 4 million of catch-up fees last year with GBP 4 million of new fund and recurring fees this year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And of course, the effect of the recently completed BIFM acquisition in Infrastructure will start to come through in the second half.",1010
18511,"2013m11","On the cost side of the equation, we continue to make excellent progress, and we expect to exceed our revised cost reduction targets of GBP 60 million of savings by the end of this financial year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We said it would take a further GBP 7 million of implementation costs to get there, and we've reflected GBP 4 million of those in the first half.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've also made more progress to reduce costs associated with the balance sheet.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've achieved the target of reducing our gross debt to below GBP 1 billion in April, and the balance now stands at GBP 873 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And you can see the benefits of this in the gross interest charge for the period of GBP 28 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The interest charge in the first half was GBP 62 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In the short term, however, we're not planning any more significant changes to bring the debt down further, and you can see here what the gross debt is made up of: our public bonds, which mature in 2017, 2023 and 2032, and we keep those positions under review but they are fully priced.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we have a small residual portfolio of derivatives which we're progressively closing down.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Their mark-to-market position is included in the gross debt number.",1010
18511,"2013m11","One negative in the results, especially in the second quarter, has been the effect of sterling strength on the accounting translation of the balance sheet.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So this slide shows you the currency makeup of our net assets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It also gives you the breakdown of how movements against sterling in the dollar and rupee, in particular, have contributed to the GBP 79 million translation loss in the period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Now as I'm sure you're all aware, currency markets remain volatile, but we remain focused on cash-to-cash returns rather than periodic translations.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I'd now like to take you through some more detail on each of our 3 businesses: Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Private Equity has had another strong result, supported by good realizations and portfolio performance.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Infrastructure continues to make an important contribution to our annual cash operating profit, as does Debt Management's growth in AUM.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So taking Infrastructure first.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Stable fee income and reduced operating cost base have improved the operational performance of the Infrastructure business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The European portfolio has supported good performance at 3i Infrastructure plc, and our 34% holding has provided portfolio income of GBP 11 million in the period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I've talked about the currency effect of the Indian rupee, but the Indian Infrastructure Fund asset valuations also reflects some specific operational and financing issues, and the group's direct holding in the India fund gave rise to a net unrealized value reduction of GBP 24 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our recently completed platform acquisition is an important development, and it will increase AUM by a further GBP 780 million and be added to the GBP 1.",1010
18511,"2013m11","5 billion seen here.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The combined team will be even better placed for fundraising.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Almost all of the capital invested by the group in the first half has been to support the development of the Debt Management business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The team launched Harvest VII, which is their first new European CLO issued since the inception of the business in 3i, and momentum continues with 3i providing capital for U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","and European warehouses in the expectation of more CLOs to come.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This, together with the Fraser Sullivan acquisition last year, has resulted in an increase of more than 40% of AUM in the last 12 months.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This business supports the improvements in our annual cash operating profit, and it has delivered a net return of 12.",1010
18511,"2013m11","5% in the period before GBP 8 million of acquisition accounting adjustments.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Simon has said the Private Equity business drives the proprietary capital returns.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Strong realizations of GBP 528 million at an uplift of 32% over March 2013 values, and an average cash-to-cash money multiple of 1.",1010
18511,"2013m11","6x show you the improving quality of the portfolio and, of course, supports our dividend policy.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Investments in the period was low with no new investments, but the pipeline is much stronger and our recently announced investments in GIF, JMJ and Scandlines are positive developments, accounting for about GBP 185 million of 3i's capital.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I'm now going to take you through portfolio and valuations, but it is also worth noting that a significant contribution to the marked improvement in net return shown here is also the reduction in the cost base.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We look at the Private Equity portfolio by region, by sector and by vintage.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The strong performance of the post-2010 investments has also improved the diversity of the vintage exposure, and we've realized a significant number of assets from earlier years.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So another key development in the makeup of the portfolio is the number of assets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have said we'd like to reduce that overall number, and we've successfully reduced the number of assets in the Private Equity portfolio by 15 in the period from 102 to 87.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The top 25 now represent over 75% of the value.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And you can see that most of these continue to show a positive performance trajectory.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In turn, that underpins stability in valuations.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Now there has been plenty of discussion about some of our largest assets like Action and Element, but it's also worth noting the improvement in performance of GEKA, a 2013 vintage investment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","GEKA has been the subject of lots of focus in the monthly dashboard meetings and the value recovery is now almost back to cost.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Across the whole Private Equity portfolio, the majority of our investments, by value and by number, are growing their earnings, as you can see here.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In fact, the strength of our larger assets has supported value weighted last 12-months earnings growth of 15%.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You can also see indicators of better stability across the portfolio in a number of metrics here: increased earnings, especially in our larger assets; fewer companies valued using forecast earnings; a modest increase in leverage caused in part by the refinancing of Action; and the increase in multiples also reflects increased confidence in the portfolio performance.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In recent periods, some multiples have been held flat against increasing comparable sets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In this quarter, improved performance in a small number of companies has meant we've lifted that cap to set a multiple that's more in line with the market.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And you can see the effect of that here in the multiple movements of GBP 78 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Positive markets have also helped the quarter portfolio, with increases in value in the U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","-listed investments, Quintiles and GAIN in particular.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The negative movement of GBP 11 million in the DCF category relates principally to Indian assets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the GBP 13 million loss on movement to imminent sale is on a small number of minority Private Equity assets that are facing performance challenges, with the largest component relating to the Asian portfolio.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But overall, this is a solid performance, with no new provisions and good progression in earnings.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And of course, the valuations are underpinned by the strong uplifts to value in realizations that we've achieved in the period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So before closing, I just wanted to deal with some more detailed points about the dividends that we declared today.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have said we intend to pay 20p in total for the year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In keeping with our previous convention, we've declared 1/3 of that today, with 2.",1010
18511,"2013m11","7p on account of the base and 4p as a special dividend.",1010
18511,"2013m11","My plan is that we pay the base dividend out of revenue reserves when we can and that any special is paid out of capital, and both dividends will be paid together in January 2014.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So as I said at the start, we have produced another set of financials which provide clear evidence that we're delivering on our strategy successfully.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But it's not just these interim results that I'm pleased with; we have also achieved strong realizations and a stable portfolio performance.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've made good progress towards achieving an annual operating cash profit, and we now have lower interest costs and no gearing at the period end.",1010
18511,"2013m11","All of these factors have led to the activation of our dividend policy, which is allowing our shareholders to participate very directly in the success of the business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As Simon said in his opening, the business now has real momentum.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So thank you, and we're now happy to take questions.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I mean, I would just add the observation on hedging is this is an accounting adjustment, not a cash adjustment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","When we get a receipt in from a euro realization, we don't change it into sterling straight away because we know that we're probably going to be banking a euro investment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So our actual real cash damage from an appreciation in sterling is far more modest than the translation number that appears in the account because we are actively managing our receipts of currencies and how we spend that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I wouldn't get too carried away about the translation numbers, the same for dollar receipts.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The trickier element is India, which is a segue into that question.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have seen significant weakness in the rupee.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The group has an exposure through 3iN and its exposure to India.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Have an exposure directly into the 3i India Infrastructure Fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","One of the first decisions I took when I became CEO was to turn off the fundraising for the second fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I feel very pleased about that decision.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we also have some small private equity investments in India that were made several years ago.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So we're not committing any new capital to India, whether through the fund or through group directly.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And actually the exposure to India, because of the decline in the rupee, has become increasingly modest.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So let's hope we're getting towards the bottom.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the one reassurance we have is while the PE investments are not of the highest quality, I would have to say, the Infrastructure investments in the main are a pretty decent portfolio.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So we're just going to work those out in a patient way and hopefully recover our dollar cost over time.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Tom? Well, we haven't talked in detail about it, but they have 2 funds with GBP 780 million under management.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I would have thought you were talking about 1/3 to 1/2 as an initial foray of that sort of number if we're talking about a fundraise, and that will take place sometime over the next 18 months.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",1010
18511,"2013m11","First question on your hedging policy.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Obviously, you highlighted clearly that FX has had a negative impact on this NAV.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Has there been a sort of material over the last sort of 12, 18 months reduction in how much you hedged the exposures? And given sort of expectations of perhaps currency instability remaining for some time, are you convinced that sort of a reduced hedge exposure is the right way to go? Are there any plans to increase it back up again if that was the case? Second question is around sort of India exposures that you've highlighted as well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You obviously previously signaled no new Infrastructure investments in India.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But could you remind us about what you're exposures, overall, currently stand at in terms of the PE portfolio and the Infrastructure? And what are your sort of plans there? Are there any plans to sort of accelerate exits and reduce that? Yes, yes.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So you will have seen in the numbers that the carry payable for the period is higher than it's been in the past.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And actually, that's a good signal.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've talked about the improvement in the performance of 2010-plus vintages in particular.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And what we're seeing in the first half is a catch-up of some of our carry schemes payable have gone through some performance hurdles.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So to be clear, when we account for our carry, effectively, what we do is we assume that we have realized the whole portfolio at the current carrying value and then calculate the carry based on that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It isn't the same as the carry that's actually being paid, because the carry paid actually only delivers when the realizations have actually come through.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But there's an element of catch-up in the carry charge in this first half because the strong performance that you've mentioned, Eurofund V, particularly in those latter vintages has taken some of those schemes through the hurdle.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So the carry payable you'll see going forward is now much more a function of not just the realized profits, but the unrealized value growth as well because that's the accrual that's coming through.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think on the earnings disclosure I gave you, that's showing you the number of companies and it's also showing you the value attributed to those.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the ones that have got the poorer performance, the reducing earnings growth, in terms of where does it go from here, there's always got to be the caveat of some performance will be at risk in those sorts of companies.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But the focus that we have on managing these on a regular basis with the monthly dashboard mitigates that to a certain extent.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the valuation methodology also mitigates it to a certain extent because we will use forecast earnings for the current year earnings if we can see those earnings are going down.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And I showed you on an earlier slide the number of companies that we've got valued on that basis.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So it puts some risk buffer into the valuation that comes from those.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But we still have 87 assets in the Private Equity portfolio.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The top 25 are 75% of the value, but that's quite a long tail at the end, some of the more trickier assets that we're trying to work out.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Chase.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Just a couple of questions.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The new investments you made post the period end, to what extent were they co-investments or were they all 3i's capital? It was fundraising.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think what we're planning to do is lift our skirts a bit more in that with the final results.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So it may not be the final, final version, but it will be a lot more than you've received to date at the financial results.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Yes, so actually, the hedging story is quite a long one.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's actually quite related to the strategy.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So when we decided to reduce gross debt, in effect, that was taking away one of the planks of the hedging strategy because our gross debt -- we tried to get currency debt, which is actually a good tenure match for the portfolio.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Quite a considerable time ago, 3i had many investments and there was a regular turnover of assets, investments and realization flows.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So the idea of using a derivative policy to match that was broadly effective.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As we've come down to smaller numbers of assets and we've taken away the desire to have gross debt, the idea of trying to use a portfolio of derivatives to hedge the assets just ceases to be properly effective.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've got assets that are being held for 3 to 5 years, and we've got a big focus now on cash.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the liquidity drain that you can have from running a derivative program can be quite onerous in -- particularly in currency markets that we're seeing at the moment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I think the most important strategic point is that we are focused on our cash-to-cash returns from our investments.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So Simon has talked about the 2x target, and that is really what we're focused on.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So these interim accounting valuations that we have don't really go to that and -- but running the risk of having a significant liquidity drain associated with the derivative program seemed to be a risk that wasn't really giving us the right degree of reward.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So it has been particularly volatile in this 6-month period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've got the closing assets and derivative program going as well, but I think it's something that we will continue to keep under review.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think the rule of thumb I've tried to give people, and I give it with a degree of caveat because it's dependent on the makeup of the portfolio and the investment and realization flows, but roughly speaking, a 1% move on the euro is about a GBP 10 million movement, and a 1% movement in the dollar is about GBP 7 million movement.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And that's, roughly, actually where it has ended up in this 6-month period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think on retention and talent recruitment, the industry -- the private equity industry in particular is still going through a very significant shakeup.",1010
18511,"2013m11","There are real winners and losers evolving  because of the more difficult fundraising environment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And there's still a relatively low flow of transactions reflecting the broader M&A market.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think 3i is not only a survivor in that because of its permanent capital and the contributions that come from group, but it's actually going to be a winner in that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And I think we now have a portfolio of investments which are beginning to generate significant carry for the investments' executives.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So the investments that have principally been made since the beginning of '11 are a very valuable collection of investments.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That is the time when the current Private Equity team came together.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They have been the author of those investments since then.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I think they are glued pretty heavily into that set of investments because of the success of them, and that's what drives private equity investors.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I think we have much less concerns about retention than we did before.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They're also receiving 3i Group shares as part of their variable compensation.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Those shares have been doing very well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They will get the benefit of dividends that are made on those shares.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I think they will be rewarded in the same way that the shareholders are rewarded as the capital allocation policy changes.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In terms of new talent, we are beginning to see inbound calls from individuals who are talented, but are perhaps in those firms where there is more of a question mark over their survivability and their future.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So that again is another indication of our status in a changing industry.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I think if we want to, we'll be in a position to obtain new talent.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I don't see us having many gaps across our core Northern European platform at the moment, it has to be said.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And I don't have any real concerns about losing executives that I want to keep as part of that team.",1010
18511,"2013m11","What was the third point, Philip? I think in terms of -- we're not contemplating any new areas at the moment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're sticking to the 3 activities that we have.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In terms of Infrastructure, we're very keen to see a doubling of the scale of that business in terms of funds under management over the planned period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we've also set a revenue target for the Debt Management business to get to GBP 50 million of fees in that business over the planned period.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So they're really the 2 targets we have for those businesses.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Tom Mills, KBW.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Using the Barclays Infrastructure team as a platform to grow you Infrastructure assets, what should we be thinking about in terms of the size of a potential raise if you were to do on -- is there any kind of guidance you can give us on that? Have you got a mic? It's Philip Middleton at Merrill.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I just wonder if you could say quickly -- you've obviously tied it up a lot about the costs in the balance sheet and such that, which has been tremendous hard work.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Going forward, returns will be driven by the investment teams and your ability to grow and nurture those.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I wonder if you could say a little bit about talent retention and recruitment, and also a bit about how you see the prospects for third-party fundraisings over the next couple of years.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Well, I suggest Julia take the hedging question, and I'll make some comments about India.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the other question is, is when will you intend to sort of split out the profitability of the aforementioned business? Good morning, everyone.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Sorry to pull the blinds down and stop you looking at the window, but we do want your attention on the presentation.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Welcome to 3i's interim results.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've had a good first half with solid results on the back of our major restructuring last year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're now generating some real momentum in the business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've produced an excellent run of realizations, our portfolio is performing well in what remains a tricky macro environment across Europe, and our network of international offices is delivering interesting deal flow away from aggressive and competitive auction processes.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our operating costs are down and our debt is down, and we are dealing with the group's old leakages more quickly than we had originally planned.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're also seeing a very strong recovery in the performance of our 2 Private Equity funds, Eurofund V and the Growth Capital Fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This morning, I'd like to talk to you about our strategic objectives and our progress so far and our evolving business model.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Then I'll hand over to Julia who will take you through our financial performance in the first half.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Now I'd like to start by reminding you about our strategy.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's simple and it includes all 3 of 3i's businesses: Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The combination of our complementary asset management capabilities across these 3 platforms, together with our permanent capital, gives our investors a clearly differentiated and attractive value proposition.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our 3 businesses are each different in terms of what drives them, as well as the returns they deliver.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They complement each other and together, they're capable of providing an interesting balance of both income and capital returns.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You've seen this before, the 3i Value Build.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the results for this year are confirming each and every step on this slide.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our multi-year value build is based on a number of different phases of organizational change and strategic delivery.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've delivered all of the strategic priorities we set for our financial year 2013, and we're already progressing well in transition and delivery, the next phase of our plan.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our priorities for this year are clear: continue making realizations and to realize fully the benefits from the Private Equity management initiatives; look for new investments in Private Equity using proprietary capital and third-party co-investment; and continue to grow Debt Management and the Infrastructure third-party businesses.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We will also reduce our operating and funding costs even further, and we've already fully implemented our new compensation arrangements across the group.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The momentum from our exit plans has continued into the current year, as you can see, so we've generated very good value uplifts, 32% over the March valuations.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've not only been selling some decent investments, we've also been spending time tidying up the trickier end of our portfolio, with the goal of reducing the portfolio size and making it more manageable.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As I've told you before, when I review our Private Equity portfolio, I think about it in 4 buckets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's been great to see the material growth in value in bucket 1 over the last 16 months, as well as the consistent realization of bucket 2 assets at good multiples.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we continue to focus on the trickier assets in buckets 3 and 4.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This takes time, but will result in a right-sized and more manageable portfolio.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's also been pretty satisfying to see a good flow of new investment opportunities coming through our international offices.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have made 3 attractive investments in the last few months after looking at a good number of opportunities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","These are businesses where we have relevant experience and where we have bought them away from the highly competitive auction processes I mentioned a minute ago.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That way, we avoided the heavy premiums being paid across the market at the moment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As far as I am concerned, the price we pay for something is likely to be the major determinant of our return on it.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So while I'm not looking to buy cheap assets, I certainly don't expect the PE team to bring me proposals that are priced to perfection as a result of some aggressive auction process.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I would rather be patient than lay down assets with the wrong entry price, and that's particularly true with the economic uncertainties we all still face at this time.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The investing teams in 3i are charged with finding and managing investments, as well as ultimately selling them for a solid return.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But it's the Investment Committee which takes all material decisions around new investment, around financing, key people changes and around exits, as well as acting as an engaged LP in monitoring the portfolio on a monthly basis.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This committee, which I chair, is made up of a majority of individuals outside of the Private Equity investment team and enacts completely independently as a custodian of the group's proprietary capital.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Now turning to Infrastructure.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The division continued to make a good contribution to the group's cash income, and the European portfolio continues to perform well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But we saw a significant pullback in the valuations of some of our Indian assets, not least because of the challenging overall economic conditions in India and the depreciating rupee.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And Julia will talk more about foreign exchange in a minute.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've made strong progress in growing the Infrastructure business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Earlier this week, we completed our acquisition of Barclays Infrastructure Fund Management business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That acquisition is a significant milestone in the implementation of our strategy.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It adds a further $780 million to our third-party AUM.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The team based in London and Paris currently manages 2 active funds in U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","and European PPP and energy projects, so it clearly complements 3i's existing European Infrastructure product offering, which focuses on core infrastructure.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I have met and spent time with this team.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They are busy, focused people and they will double our investment capacity in Infrastructure, and we intend to leverage our enhanced platform to raise new third-party Infrastructure funds.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're also growing our Debt Management business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have recently completed our first new CLO issue in Europe, and we're seeing good opportunities in the U.",1010
18511,"2013m11","to launch further CLOs through the Fraser and Sullivan platform we acquired last year.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As you can see, we have set the team some demanding strategic objectives, but the business has a very experienced group of credit professionals running it and is well placed to build further in this changing sector.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As a result of our cost-saving progress up to March 2013, we announced in May a material increase in our cost reduction target for this current financial year to March '14.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We've moved our total cost reduction target up to GBP 60 million from the original GBP 45 million we announced in June '12.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That represents a like-for-like reduction of almost 1/3 of the total cost base of GBP 185 million that we started with in March 2012.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As the benefits of the changes we've already implemented take effect and we continue to manage the business tightly, we will see further reductions.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We will be keeping pressure on driving down costs, at the same time that we're making sure that we have the right platform and the right level of support to grow our Infrastructure and Debt Management businesses and to maintain the momentum in our Private Equity business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we've delivered another material win on our balance sheet.",1010
18511,"2013m11","As you can see, gross debt is now down to GBP 873 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And we closed the first half with net cash of GBP 28 million.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We fully implemented our new compensation arrangements, including more share-based compensation for senior staff.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This is already having a strong impact across the business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","People are much more focused on costs and as a result, our cost base is much more in line with the more efficient companies in our sector.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's good to see senior staff acting with the same discipline on costs as an owner would.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That means the interest of both our shareholders and our investors are closely aligned.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're already making strong progress in the current phase of our strategic plan transition and delivery.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The slide shows our key objectives for this year and next.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We are coming from a long way back, but we're making good progress in costs and generating new income.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're seeing growth in Debt Management and Infrastructure leading to a more balanced contribution across our 3 businesses to third-party fee income.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're seeing a material shift in capital allocation as we have reduced our costs and our debt.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And as we build third-party AUM, more of our cash is going to reinvestment and to shareholder distributions.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This financial year, we've already met our goals for gearing of less than 20% and gross debt below GBP 1 billion.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And as a result, we intend to propose a total dividend in financial year '14 of 20p per share.",1010
18511,"2013m11","That 20p will include the base dividend of 8.",1010
18511,"2013m11","1p per share.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We expect a lower level of realization activity in the second half, but we expect the balance of further realizations and new investment to support our proposed 20p distribution.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This is a very big change from 18 months ago.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And as a shareholder in the group, I am delighted with this development.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's been a real team effort, and I would like to offer my thanks to each and everyone of 3i's team.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They've been doing a great job.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Now I'd like to talk to you about 3i's evolving business model.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This is 3i's business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's distinctive because of the scale of our proprietary capital that is invested in mid-market private equity.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our proprietary capital invested alongside LP funds will provide significant upside for the shareholders once we have removed all the unnecessary leakages which the group has suffered from in the past.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think we've now achieved the right alignment of interest across the group.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We continue to put the group's own capital to work alongside third-party investors, and we've now become a much more proactive owner and manager of our portfolio of assets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And importantly, the senior and investing executives in the group now receive a significant proportion of 3i Group shares as part of their variable compensation.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They're also being measured in operational effectiveness, as well as their investment performance.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our clear objectives are both to maximize investment returns on the group's own investments and grow profitably our fund management business.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We will deliver this through the 3i Value Build.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This slide clearly shows the different contributions of our businesses between proprietary and third-party capital.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The Private Equity portfolio accounts for the bulk of that proprietary capital, while Debt Management is the largest contributor to third-party AUM and fees.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So we are now managing the group with much clearer delineation between proprietary capital investing and our fund management activities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Going forward, you'll be able to track our progress through different KPIs measuring our performance at 3i Group in our usage of proprietary capital and through our fund management activities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We have a clear target of generating annual income, profits and capital flows that we can use for shareholder returns and for reinvestment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The first phase of our turnaround plan has gone very well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I'm particularly pleased by our progress on realizations and the quality of the recent investments in Private Equity.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And as I said earlier, we have a new set of priorities for the current financial year and we've made a good start in meeting these new challenges.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Now I'd like to close by making one final point.",1010
18511,"2013m11","There continues to be a great deal of focus on our NAV as the appropriate proxy for our share price.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But as some of you know, I don't hold with that view.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I believe NAV is a measure which has more relevance for a company or trust that owns listed securities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The bulk of our proprietary capital, and we have a lot, is invested in mid-market private equity investments, where we are planning to generate real alpha by making at least 2x return on our cost.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But we can't describe the target return to our core [ph] revaluations because these are illiquid private company holdings, and business plans for these investments are only partially executed.",1010
18511,"2013m11","This leads us to be cautious in our valuations at any particular point in time as our average EBITDA multiple and the premium on our recent realizations would indicate.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Our experience over the past 12 months has been that we can obtain significant premier to our book values if we sell assets at the right time, i.",1010
18511,"2013m11","at the culmination of our exit plans, into a supportive financing market and where financial or trade buyers are prepared to pay a premium to win an asset.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We held our Private Equity Investor Day in September, focusing on Action and Element in order to communicate the potential quality and value growth in our keeper-bucket assets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","These are assets, which have much greater potential than 2x.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In the case of Action, there are several high-growth discount stocks listed in Europe and North America with similar growth rates to Action, but none of them trade at 10x EBITDA as we value our stake in Action today.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The same is true for Element in that we are only partway through our plan for Element, so we value our stake at a discount to the listed peers even though the peers are growing much less strongly.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So when people think about our NAV being a useful proxy for 3i's share price, they should remember that it doesn't reflect either the complete execution of our exit plans or the premium that can come from selling an asset well at the right time or, for that matter, the potential value in our fund management platform.",1010
18511,"2013m11","None of this, of course, means that valuations cannot go down as well as up, but that's true of listed stocks as well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Okay, enough from me.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I'll hand over to Julia.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Yes, I thought I'd get asked that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're obviously very keen that we build a vintage of investments under this new team from the beginning of '11.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And I think LPs need to see that team not only making investments and managing them, but realizing them as well.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So my judgment is we're still somewhere away from launching a new Private Equity fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I don't think it will happen this year and I don't think it will happen on next financial year, but it could well happen the year after that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But I'm not seeing it much earlier than that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Just a couple of questions, if I can.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You mentioned earlier that there's good generation in the sort of carry in the performance fees payable.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I just wanted to -- how should we think about that number in the second half because it's quite sort of material in the first half and then sort of into next year? And then in terms of the Private Equity portfolio, I just wanted to check, there's a slide there where you were talking about the earnings growth of some of the companies, and there's sort of effectively 1/4 of the companies with double-digit earning declines.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I just wanted to -- how should we think about the turnaround of those businesses? Are they sort of structurally challenged and you wouldn't expect a recovery or how should I think about that? And so just a final question, if I may.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Just following on from that second one about the earnings growth, where would you expect your funds' sort of performance to be in sort of 12 months' time? You've obviously increased it dramatically, but realizations are sort of slowing or you're signaling they're going to slow.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So how do you -- where should that performance number be in 12 months? It's Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",1010
18511,"2013m11","You also made good progress in terms of growing funds under management, Debt and Infrastructure.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Are there any other sectors that you think you'd like to expand into? And on Debt and Infrastructure, do you have any sort of aspirational targets as to where you'd like to get to in terms of funds under management, i.",1010
18511,"2013m11","for the next few years? They were a mixture, so Scandlines was a Eurofund V follow-on investment.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So that was made through the fund, so it was 3i money and Eurofund V money.",1010
18511,"2013m11","It was a proprietary capital investment, and JMJ was made with one of our managed account, co-investment relationships, so a mixture.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I'd say on that, those bucket 3 assets, those challenged assets, the -- we have changed 13 of the CEOs in those buckets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So we are very aggressively focusing on those buckets.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They can't avoid the macros, some of those companies.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And despite what we're all reading in the papers and everything else, it's still a low-flow, tricky macro for many medium-sized businesses out there.",1010
18511,"2013m11","And the ones that tend to be vulnerable to that tend to sit in our bucket 3.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So we're putting a lot of effort into getting our cost back.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We're getting near to our cost.",1010
18511,"2013m11","We had a couple of triumphs recently that we announced: one was Bestinvest, which was bought at a very high price at the peak of the market; and the other, Everis, the consultancy in Spain, which NTT has purchased.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So I mean, we are getting some good breaks in that bucket, but we can't avoid the macro.",1010
18511,"2013m11","The macro is tough for some of these companies.",1010
18511,"2013m11","In terms of Eurofund V performance, again, what is interesting is inbound and we've started to get LPs asking us when we're going to raise our next fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","They're all getting very excited about the turnaround.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think there's much more material turnaround to come.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So having taken it from a low point of 0.",1010
18511,"2013m11","63 to 1, there's still a lot more to come in that fund.",1010
18511,"2013m11","I think it will have a respectable outcome, very much driven by the latter investments, so the end of 2010 to the end of the fund type investments.",1010
18511,"2013m11","So we're feeling very good about that.",1010
18511,"2013m11","But we want those runs to be on the board for when we start the next fundraising.",1010
18511,"2013m11","If there are no more questions, thanks for your attention.",1010
18511,"2013m11","Appreciate it.",1010
18511,"2013m5","Okay, why don't I take the last bit first.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In terms of those arrangements, firstly, it's not discretionary money.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That money is there if they like the investment in question.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But these 2 institutions have been long-term investors with 3i in a number of structures, and we know each other extremely well, and they've been very active investors with a past.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So we have a high degree of confidence that they like what we like and they rate the current team, which is why they've entered into these framework agreements.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The economics of these framework agreements are equivalent to invested money economics in a more general buyout fund.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So they don't pay commitment fees, but they will pay deal fees, management fees and carry to the team in return for good performance there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So they're very similar to invested money in a fund.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The taste of the 2 is a little different.",1364
18511,"2013m5","One likes to hit boundaries, fours and sixes in terms of the checks it writes.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And the other ones to have a slice of most of our deals with smaller checks.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So they're complementary in that regard.",1364
18511,"2013m5","They obviously don't want their name disclosed at this point.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But I think it will become evident as we invest who they are.",1364
18511,"2013m5","If we just talk about the zeros, it's quite a numerous -- it's at too numerous bucket I'm afraid.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I do know the exact number, but there's quite a lot of them, and enterprise was the most relevant decent example of that, and I'm sure some of them will be recovering above their base value.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But it will be single digits and millions or tens of millions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It won't be hundreds of millions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Thanks, Julia.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So we've had a productive year at 3i, and we're changing into a tightly run business with a target of generating annual income, profits and cash flows to be used for shareholder returns and reinvestment, without the large elements of leakage that we've seen in recent years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We see the group as having 2 parts: Proprietary capital, which is about generating portfolio income and capital profits; and fund management, which manages both the proprietary capital and third-party capital in return for fee income, carried interest and performance fees.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Going forward, you will be able to track our progress and performance not only as a group, but you'll be able to measure our use of proprietary capital, as well as our performance as a fund manager.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We are convinced that this greater transparency will be crucial in judging how we are doing.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As I said earlier, each of our 3 businesses has different drivers and return characteristics, but together, they provide an attractive balance of income and capital returns.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And the combination of our 3 asset management skills, together with our permanent capital, provides us with a differentiated model just at the time when the private equity sector is going for a very fundamental shakeout.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The first phase of our turnaround plan has gone well, and we've exceeded all of our targets, and we're already seeing the benefits in materially improved financial performance.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And as I said earlier, we have a new set of priorities for this year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Now I'd try and communicate this plan, and our performance, as clearly and as simply as possible.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But don't be fooled into thinking, all we are doing is just taking out a few costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This project is far more complicated than that.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And it's required a lot of careful judgment after some very detailed analysis.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The business is multilayered with important fund and LP commitments over many years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","3i's geographically diverse and employs many senior, experienced and independent-minded investment professionals.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's got an oversized PE portfolio to match its geographic diversity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And the asset management initiatives are critical to optimizing value from these and from future investments.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In short, the business requires relentless leadership and cut-through to make sure everybody stays on track, and we avoid the banana skins of the past.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That having been said, I'd like to just close by saying thank you to the team at 3i.",1364
18511,"2013m5","They've responded very well to some tough actions this year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I really admire the determined way they picked up their game and risen to the challenges that have been put in front of them.",1364
18511,"2013m5","When I first stood up as CEO last June and presented our new strategy, I talked about a few things that I believe underpin strong businesses: A clear vision guiding an ambitious but practical strategy; integrity and respect for individuals, be they colleagues, customers or suppliers; high energy levels and a good work ethic; and clear decisions based on thorough analysis, followed by rapid implementation.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Today's 3i team has embraced this approach with real enthusiasm.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The culture is changing, and we become a better focused, flatter organization with a can-do attitude and high energy levels.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We're doing things smartly again, and I'm excited about the progress we will make over the next few years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's going to be rewarding for everyone involved.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Thank you for listening.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we'd now like to throw it open to Q&A.",1364
18511,"2013m5","If we look at how the market is developing and the pipeline in terms of potential investments, the comments I would make are, over the last 6 months, we've seen a very considerable improvements in pipeline potential investments.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It have been very lean priced for that period, particularly, in terms of quality, as well as quantity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So we've seen some better prospects in Northern Europe, as well as the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","and Brazil.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We think these prospects are more interesting for both numerous and quality reasons.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we've got pretty close on 2 investments in Europe, one we couldn't agree a final price with the vendor so we decided to pull back from that.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's an engineering business based out of Germany.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And another business in Holland we got overbid at the last stage of an auction with a very aggressive price for another private equity house.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So we are there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We are in the game.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have the better with in Brazil and the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","at the moment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","with it's particularly interesting, and it reflects businesses that we like, which have strong capabilities in both Europe and North America, like HILITE like Element.",1364
18511,"2013m5","These sorts of businesses.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I don't think we're going to see a prolonged phase where we're doing just selling and not investing.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I don't envisage that at all.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In any event, though, what I'd like to see in terms of the shape of the group is that we have about half the Private Equity investments we have today.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So we're on a bit of a journey to reduce bit oversized portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We need to be more active in that side of things.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I think the next few years will help us in that regard.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Good morning, everyone.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's almost 1 year since I stood up in June 2012 to take you through the future strategy of 3i and our restructuring plan.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'm pleased to say that we've made very significant and rapid progress in implementing our plan.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our strong set of results for the year, which show material improvement across the board against 2012, clearly demonstrate the progress that we've made.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've delivered against all of the priorities we set ourselves for the financial year ending March 2013 and, in particular, we've materially exceeded our cost and debt reduction targets.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've seen considerable improvement in our Private Equity performance, including an impressive run of cash realizations.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In short, it's been a very good year of recovery for 3i after too many disappointing ones.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I'd like to start by focusing on our strategic objectives and progress over the last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Julia will take you through the groups financial performance, and I will then make some concluding remarks before I'd open to Q&A.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But first, I'd like to remind you about our strategy.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's simple and embraces all 3 of our businesses: Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The combination of our complementary asset management capabilities across these 3 platforms, together with our permanent capital, gives our investors a differentiated and attractive value proposition.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our 3 businesses are each different in terms of drivers and return characteristics, but they complement each other, and together, they're capable of providing an interesting balance of income and capital growth.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You will have seen this slide before.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It captures the key return drivers for each of our businesses, as well as demonstrating their cyclicality.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Now I've bought shares in 3i because, after analyzing the fundamentals of the group and its prospects, it was clear to me that the business, if ran well, represented a compelling multiyear value proposition.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I was convinced that this value proposition was underpinned by valuable portfolio of investments and by the prospect of significant cash distributions over time.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Today, everybody at 3i sees the simplicity of growing the earnings of our portfolio, realizing our investments at attractive cash multiples, generating annual cash profits by running our 3 fund management businesses well, using our permanent capital to take advantage of value and growth opportunities, and turning this into cash for the benefit of LPs shareholders.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I hope it all sounds very simple, but it's actually taken quite a lot of hard work and careful thought to begin delivering on this strategy and moving 3i on to the solid footing it's on today.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've had to put in some fundamental new asset management initiatives in Private Equity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've refocused that division and put a real emphasis on exit planning and smart execution.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Across our businesses, we are focusing on growing third-party AUM and growing our income against a rightsized cost base.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've used our capital to exploit opportunities in the debt management sector, and we've reduced gross debt and our cost of funding, so that more of the cash goes back to shareholders and back to the business to be invested.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our multiyear value build is based on a number of different phases of organizational change in strategic delivery.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've delivered all of the strategic priorities we set for the financial year 2013.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we're already progressing well in transition and delivery, the next phase of our plan.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You will recall that we set ourselves 6 strategic objectives last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I'd now like to take you through our progress against each in a little more detail.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Last June, we said we'd reduce our headcount by 160 by the 31st of March.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In fact, we achieved a net headcount reduction of 168.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's almost 40% of the group's headcount that we had in March last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we closed the 6 offices we said we would, and we reduced our property expenses even further by making significant rental savings in both London and New York.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We originally targeted annualized cost savings of GBP 40 million by March '13 and, in fact, we cut out GBP 51 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That puts us 28% ahead of our target and also represents, coincidentally, a 28% reduction to our opening costs of GBP 185 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Over 70% of the staff reduction has come from the back office.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's 119 out of the 168.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As a result, we have a better balance of investment staff versus back-office support.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And this slide gives you an idea of where the headcount reductions taken place.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Geography has determined that the reductions in the investment teams with finance, admin, property, IT, HR and marketing accounting for 119 staff reductions in the group functions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And here's a little bit more detail on where we've over-performed in cost reductions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This slide gives you some examples of how further savings have come about.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In general, we have found additional savings through a sharper focus on cost control and by introducing much stronger approval mechanisms across the group.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've also delayered to become a simple, less hierarchical organization.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As a result of our progress up to March 2013, we're today announcing a material increase in our cost reduction target for this current financial year to March 2014.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We're moving our total cost reduction target up to GBP 60 million from the original GBP 45 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So that represents a like-for-like reduction of almost 1/3 against our cost base of GBP 185 million in March last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As the benefits of the changes we've already implemented take place, and we continue to manage the business tightly, we will see further reductions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we'll be doing this at the same time that we're making sure that we have the right platform and the right level of support to grow our Debt Management and Infrastructure businesses.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we've delivered another material win around the balance sheet.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Having set the target of GBP 1 billion of gross debt by June '13, we bought it down to close the GBP 900 million by April.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's a reduction of 44% from our starting position of over GBP 1.",1364
18511,"2013m5","6 billion in March last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And that's a clear reflection of our success in realizing from our Private Equity portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","An important part of restructuring over the last year has been to achieve a greater degree of central control and focus.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And to get there, we've removed organizational complexity and bureaucracy.",1364
18511,"2013m5","By removing committees and hierarchies, we've created a much more efficient organization.",1364
18511,"2013m5","When you combine that simplification with a more energized team, you can create a much more dynamic culture.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And that's exactly what we've done, a simple organization with shorter lines of communication leads to much faster and more consistent decision-making.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And that in turn is driving improved performance.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In June last year, we announced 6 new asset management initiatives in Private Equity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That program has now been substantially implemented and is beginning to make a huge difference to the quality of our asset management in Private Equity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You've seen some of this already with our realization successes and the improvement in the overall portfolio value, and we expect to see further benefits over time.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've also revised our investment review process.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've combined our separate investment and portfolio committee structures under 1 investment committee, which I chair.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The new investment committee considers all decisions from the original investment ideas, right through the divestments.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've also involved the investment committee early on in the investment process, and we've involved it in all material decisions in the life of an investment, such as refinancing and senior management changes.",1364
18511,"2013m5","With the geographic breadth and sheer scale of that 3i investment portfolio, I'm convinced these changes are critical.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've tied up our investment processes with asset management, or management assessment, rather, and we made our approach consistent across all our investment teams.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we've become much more proactive in replacing underperforming management.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Since September last year, we've replaced 11 chairmen and CEOs after our proper evaluation of their performance.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And as most of you will recall, the introduction of the 3i dashboard last September has transformed how quickly we recognize and react to performance issues within our portfolio of companies.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's working very well, and it's leading to new improved asset management performance across the entire portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Since March last year, we've increased the emphasis on developing detailed extra strategies for all our equity private investments.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We review and update those plans twice a year with a view to optimizing cash proceeds for shareholders and LPs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","If an investment is ready to be sold, we'll take advantage of market conditions, but equally, we're prepared to think if there is better value down the road, or that we should -- we're prepared to consider refusing a cheap offer or waiting for better value down the road.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You've recently seen the results of this planning and execution with the sales of Mold-Masters and Civica and with plans for each asset in our Private Equity portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In some cases, those plans were announced a number of years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In other cases, we have like companies likely to be sold in the near term.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's been an excellent year for realizations.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've generated a total of GBP 575 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's an uplift of 49% over the opening book value and a money multiple of 2.",1364
18511,"2013m5","1x against our initial investment, not a bad performance in my book.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'd also like to remind you again that I believe cash is the best measure of the performance of our investments.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I also feel that, in many cases, a focus on our current NAV fails to recognize the likely future or auction value for each of the investments we have and that we've set out in our individual exit plans.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I hope our recent sales are convincing you that we've got this right.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We can achieve good premium offers when the financing markets are robust as they are right now.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We refocused our Private Equity business around Northern Europe, the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","and Brazil.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've suspended new investments in Asia and Spain, and we're highly selective in the core regions we are investing in.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's no secret that this has been a difficult environment for investing.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And while we found some investing opportunities in Brazil, we've struggled to get comfortable with the pricing in Northern Europe, in particular.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So in this environment, we're delighted to be more focused on selling.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As most of you know, it has been a really good selling environment with strong financial markets and plenty of cash-rich private equity and corporate buyers.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I think it's fair to say that our recent record shows that we are taking good advantage of these conditions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The next slide I showed you last June, the Private Equity portfolio has treated well in a generally very difficult macro environment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've had resilient performances in Northern Europe, the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","and Brazil, some very tough conditions in Spain, and a rapid deterioration in the environment in France and some very tough conditions in India.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And when I review the Private Equity portfolio, I think about it in 4 buckets.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The keepers, e.",1364
18511,"2013m5","action, element, borne, which offer terrific long-term growth.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Second is the strong performers, which we expect to good -- achieve good sales proceeds, like Civica, like Mold-Masters, which I mentioned just a minute ago.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The third bucket is made up of those investments which have the potential for material value recovery from where they have historically traded, companies such as Azaelus and OneMed.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And finally, what I call the zeros, which account for little of our NAV today, but represent auction value, in the case of the enterprise value, recovers above the level of the debt.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The company enterprise was a good example of this category.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The third bucket is our largest bucket by cost of investments and has significant scope to increase value over time.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As you know, we conducted the group-wide compensation review this year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","At around 60% of operating costs, the payroll is our largest expense.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've got to make sure we have a legitimate split of returns between shareholders and employees.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's the only way we can retain both the right talent and create long-term shareholder value.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have broad shareholders support for our new proposals.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And these new compensation arrangements are to be introduced in June 2013.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Going forward, group compensation will be driven by how we perform against our key strategic objectives.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This will give us a much clearer link between staff compensation and shareholder returns.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In addition, a lot bigger proportion of total compensation will be in deferred shares of 3i Group plc.",1364
18511,"2013m5","For example, senior staff in the group will have a shareholding target, which will be set as a multiple of annual gross salary, so that we can enhance our alignment with shareholders.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We're already making strong progress in the next phase of our strategic plan, transition and delivery.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And this slide shows our key objectives for the year ahead.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We expect cash income to cover operating cost by March 2014 on a run rate basis.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And by the way, 3i has not done that for a very long time, to lead to a more balanced contribution for third-party fee income over time.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In Private Equity, we focus on finding the best way to reestablish our investment track record.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've done that by investing alongside institutional coinvestors in Brazil and establishing 2 framework agreements for investing in Northern Europe.",1364
18511,"2013m5","One of these agreements is with a leading U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","institution and one is with a very large sovereign wealth fund.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Infrastructure continue to make a strong contribution to the group's cash income last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The European portfolio performed well, and the value of the holding in 3i Infrastructure increased by 7%.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We did see some pullback in the valuations of some of our Indian assets, given the challenging supply-side and macroeconomic conditions we face in India.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've got one of the best teams in the Infrastructure sector, and our pipeline in European opportunities is good going into this financial year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we therefore expect to see good growth.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our Debt Management business has had a very strong year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","They've almost doubled third-party funds under management to GBP 6.",1364
18511,"2013m5","They also acquired a very strong U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","franchise in Fraser Sullivan and issued almost 1 billion of CLOs in the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The business has a very experienced group of credit professionals and is well-placed to take advantage of further opportunities as this sector continues to change.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This financial year, we intend to pursue our enhanced capital distribution policy.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've already met our goals for gearing of less than 20% and gross debt below GBP 1 billion.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We intend to distribute 15% to 20% of gross cash proceeds in the next 12 months, and the GBP 222 million from Mold-Masters is going to be part of this calculation, and all other realizations this year will contribute.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The current total, including Mold-Masters and realizations announced so far, is GBP 422 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So our priorities for the year are clear: To realize fully the benefits from the Private Equity asset management initiatives, continue to grow Debt Management and Infrastructure's third-party businesses, a look for new investments in Private Equity using proprietary capital and third-party coinvestors.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We'll further reduce our operating and funding costs and fully implement our new compensation arrangements.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So clearly, it's been a good year for 3i.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I'd now like to ask Julia to take you through the numbers.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Any other questions? I've got to get to the AGM some going to wrap it up year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Thanks for coming everyone and we'll take questions later in the day if you want.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And my other question was about the hedging policy.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I mean I know last year was very good on the currency front.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Could you just detail a little bit more how that's change and what the effect of currency exposures are in the NAV level? Daniel Garrod, Barclays.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Couple of questions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Firstly, the 4 buckets of investments that you referred to.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You've obviously done well, realizing out of the #2 just sort of strong performers.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I wonder if you could go to the fourth bracket that you called the zeros.",1364
18511,"2013m5","How many assets are in that category, and can you provide any sort of color on the experience with enterprise about the possibles sort of hidden value creation in that element of your portfolio? The second question is around the statements this morning of the new committed go investments from a number of institutions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I wonder if you could provide any more color on that a number of institutions, whether there's any change in fees you obviously mentioned you get fees and carry on this potential new investments, coinvestments, with those institutions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Is there any change in fee structure of those coinvestments compared to, say, your Eurofund V? It's Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I've got a couple.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Firstly on the unrealized volume movements on Slide 57.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I think the second largest contributor was other plus GBP 73 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Now can you just give us a bit of a breakdown on that? And then the second one was on in Infrastructure.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I think you said there was a good business opportunity there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I was just wondering what the plans are for growing that business, clearly I think conditions probably couldn't be more favorable than they are today for the asset class, so what are the plans to grow assets under management? Thank you.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And yes, what we typically have in the other category are companies, which are valued on a different sort of basis.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So the majority of our portfolio is valued on an earnings basis.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have some companies, which be involved on industry metrics, for example, Hyperion is an example of that we've seen.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And of course, ACR would be another example.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So it's a multitude of things.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's Henry Freeman from Investec.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Just following up from the question before on your new 2 strategic coinvestors.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Is this the kind of format that we could expect going forward for particularly Private Equity fund raising or cost fundraising, rather than raising money through traditional LP funds? Yes, I think if you look in the disclosure that we gave you on the valuation of the assets, the 2 principal ones talk about the Civica and Quintiles, neither of which were on an uplift to sail basis at the end of the period.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Quintiles was valued at GBP 103 million that we announced that we've received GBP 50 million of proceeds and residual holding is worth GBP 133 million based on the IPO price.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Share price actually gone up since then but I'm not calculating on a daily basis.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And Civica is the other example, which is in the books at GBP 84 million at the end of March.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we just disclosed proceeds on that asset of GBP 127 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I think actually that both good examples of what this realization market is like.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We strike a fair value for our assets.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I clearly have cited some of these processes, but that's one factor that we take into account a degree of execution risk.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And it's one of the reasons why we would say that the NAV won't ever really reflect the very, very good M&A conditions that we're currently seeing at the moment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Thank you, Simon.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So you've just heard about the significant progress that we've been making against the strategic objectives that we set last June.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'd now like to take you through our financial results and show you the evidence of that progress, and I'd like to take you through the impact that, that progress will have on our financial year '14.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So in headline terms, the change is obvious.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have made growth portfolio return of GBP 546 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's driven by realizations that we've achieved, a good uplift to that opening value.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The cost of running the business is down to GBP 170 million, and that's including restructuring costs of GBP 30 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our balance sheet today is a lot stronger, with gross debt reduced to GBP 1.",1364
18511,"2013m5","1 billion and gearing down to 11%, and our NAV is much improved at 311p.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So this chart shows you how the NAV has improved.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The opening NAV has been reduced by dividends we paid during the year and by the cost of implementing our new strategy.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But strong realizations, good earnings growth and net fee income have been a big contributor of 41p.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And 20p of that performance relates to cash realized profits.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And now that we report our NAV quarterly, here is the same reconciliation for the fourth quarter.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Here, you can see how the momentum has built in the year with an 8.",1364
18511,"2013m5","7% increase in NAV in the fourth quarter compared to 2.",1364
18511,"2013m5","5% in the preceding 3.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Before I get on the business performance, I'd just like to spend some time taking you through the changes in our cost base that Simon talked about.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Then we'll look at the balance sheet structure, which has also been an important change this year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Just to recap on the key metrics that Simon talked about earlier.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We said we'd reduced our run rate cost base by GBP 40 million by the 31st of March 2013.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've beaten our target by 28%, and we've reduced the cost base by GBP 51 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We said we've reduced headcount by 160 by the 31st of March 2013.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In fact, we reduced headcount by 168.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We said that actual cost for the year would be about the same level as the year before.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Actual cost is 6% lower.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That includes acquisition, as well as an GBP 8 million accounting benefit that we get from the bonus shares awarded as part of the compensation review, that benefit will unwind over the next 3 to 4 years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's very good progress but it's a bit complicated by whether we're talking about including or excluding acquisitions or talking about run rate to actual costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","At the highest level, we started the year with a run rate cost base of GBP 185 million or 1.",1364
18511,"2013m5","8% of our assets under management.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've reduced the cost base by delivering annual savings of GBP 51 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","During the year, we added GBP 7 million to that cost base when the Debt Management business grew by acquiring the Invesco contracts and the Fraser Sullivan platform.",1364
18511,"2013m5","These additional costs I'm talking about are covered by fees.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But here, we're looking at gross costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And that means we finished the year at 31st of March 2013, with the cost run rate of GBP 140 million or 1.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And how do we reconcile actual and run rate.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So here's the detailed reconciliation of the components, the adjustments for acquisitions and the full year effect of changes and savings.",1364
18511,"2013m5","One of the changes that we've talked about is the compensation review, and you can see here the change in the makeup of fixed and variable compensation this year compared to last.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Better performance has generated higher variable pay of the general bonus pool which reduced by 50% last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And there has been a step change in the amount of shared awards to better align people with shareholders, the GBP 8 million cost of which will be accounted over the next 3 to 4 years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And so to summarize the new targets.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We said the cost would reduce by GBP 45 million by the end of financial year 2014.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We're now resetting that goal to achieve total run rate savings of GBP 60 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We said the implementation costs would be GBP 30 million to achieve run rate savings of GBP 45 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And that we'd spend GBP 30 million -- we spent GBP 30 million to achieve savings of GBP 51 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We'll now spend another GBP 7 million to deliver the total of GBP 60 million savings that we've targeted.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Turning then to the balance sheet.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As Simon has already set out, we said that we would reduce gross debt to GBP 1 billion by June 2013.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Actual gross debt at the 31st of March was GBP 1.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Since then, we've repaid GBP 164 million of drawings under one of our committed facilities.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So at the end of April, gross debt is GBP 917 million, and that's substantially below the target and were ahead in timing as well.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our net interest payable is GBP 91 million, that's flat compared to last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And interest receivable has reduced as you'd expect with our lower cash balances.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The gross interest payable in financial year 2013 of GBP 97 million was modestly lower than the prior year of GBP 103 million, but significantly, this year's expense included GBP 25 million of accelerated interests cost that are associated with the early repayment of a number of tranches of our debt.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So since we accelerated the reduction of the gross debt position, we start financial year 2014 with a much simple simpler profile.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our liquidity is made up of cash of GBP 746 million and undrawn committed facilities of GBP 336 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's before reflecting the repayments of the drawings just after the period in, which doesn't change liquidity but switches cash to undrawn.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've Reviewed the level of equity that we have to hold, taking account of the lumpy nature of investment flows, our fund commitments and the ongoing cost of running the business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Simon explained the 3i business model is much simpler and there is a lot more central control.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That means the level of liquidity that we hold can be reduced.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But I expect that we will always want to maintain a minimum cash balance of about GBP 500 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our gross debt profile is now very simple.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Starting at the end of the chart and working back, we have a long-dated sterling bonds, which costs about GBP 35 million a year and our quality assets to pension funds who are searching for return and duration.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's GBP 280 million outstanding on our 2017 eurobond, which costs about GBP 60 million per year depending on FX.",1364
18511,"2013m5","If you take account of commitment fees on the undrawn facilities and other balance sheet-related costs, I am confident that the gross interest cost will be less than GBP 60 million in financial year 2014.",1364
18511,"2013m5","One final point to note on simplification.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have a more straightforward business model and that means a smaller number of assets, so we're changing the way that we manage currency risk.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Instead of hedging on a portfolio basis, currency risk management is now an explicit part of our investment and divestment decisions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Altogether, we have a much stronger balance sheet, with net debt reduced to GBP 335 million and gearing down to 11.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Of course, the reduction in net debt reflects the success of the business overall and our Private Equity business, in particular, in delivering strong realizations in the year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I'd now like to talk to you about our business performance.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Simon has talked about how each business lines contribute to the group performance, with a different emphasis on capital returns and fee income for each of those business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Clearly the most significant improvement has been in our Private Equity business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've generated very strong realized profits, good earnings growth and a reduction in operating costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Infrastructure and Debt Management have provided a stable contribution in the period.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'm going to talk briefly about those 2 businesses first.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our Infrastructure business invests in Europe and in India, and we are seeing a stark contrast in the performance in those 2 regions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So the modest loss of GBP 2 million shown here masks a GBP 24 million gain that we made on our 34% holding on 3i Infrastructure plc, offset by value reductions of GBP 27 million in the Indian portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","From a strategic perspective, Infrastructure business generated good cash return, good portfolio income and fees.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Growing income profitably is the key strategic objective for our Debt Management business, and it's a capital-light business for the group.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have only invested GBP 46 million in this business in the year, with assets under management almost doubling to GBP 6.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We invested GBP 8 million to bring in the Fraser Sullivan platform, acquired the Invesco contracts and supported the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","team who have raised almost $1 billion of new capital in second half.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We set the target of growing fee income for the business to GBP 50 million in the next 3 to 5 years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The fees of GBP 31 million this year are a mixture of existing funds where improved credit performance has generated another GBP 6 million of catch-up fees after last year's GBP 11 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","New business has down only a further GBP 6 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So fees are good news but profitable growth is key.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And the net returns you see here are still modest.",1364
18511,"2013m5","However, there is quite a lot of accounting noise in the operating cost of the business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So it's worth noting of the GBP 32 million of cost shown here, GBP 8 million relates to acquisition accounting or due diligence costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'd now like to come onto the Private Equity business performance.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Private Equity accounts for 82% of our balance sheet investments, so strong results are a very important contributor to the growth in our NAV.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our realized profits of GBP 190 million and an uplift over opening value of 49% are evidence that the maturity of the portfolio has developed and that the increased focus on the exit plans is already generating results, and Simon has taken you through the significant assets generating this result.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'll come onto realized profits in a minute, because there's a few other points I want to note in the overall net return for this business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Portfolio income has fallen in the period.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's partly as a result of assets sold but also because of the effect of some restructuring and provisions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","However, the cash element of income was stable at GBP 39 million compared to GBP 40 million in the prior year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Fee income is also lower as expected in December 2012, and we have the full year effect of Eurofund V, which ended its investment period in November 2011.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Finally, we can also see here the benefit of cost reductions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The GBP 114 million includes GBP 23 million of restructuring costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Altogether, the businesses generated a net portfolio return of GBP 416 million or 15.",1364
18511,"2013m5","8%, and that's a significant improvement from the loss of GBP 441 million in the prior year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","A big driver of that change is due to portfolio valuation.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As you can see here, 81% of the portfolio is in Northern Europe, North America and Brazil, which is where our investment efforts are focused.",1364
18511,"2013m5","There have been no significant changes in sector mix.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And although the new vintages continue to grow as a proportion of the portfolio, we still have a majority, 58% by value, of the 2007, '08 and '09 vintages.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This part of the portfolio is beginning to perform more strongly, and we're now seeing a number of good exits, such as the recently announced Civica and Quintiles transaction, as well as Mold-Masters and Hyperion.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our continued focus on supporting investments that we made with high leverage and high energy prices remains critical.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've since seen significant increases in value in some of these businesses and a reduction in leverage, as operational improvements and refinancings come through.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The 20 assets shown here account for 62% of the Private Equity portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As you can see on the right, the direction of travel is improving but the majority of these companies, particularly the larger investments.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've excluded 5 large investments from this list for commercial reasons, but they also follow the general trend.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In terms of valuations, there are some consistent themes.",1364
18511,"2013m5","On a valuated basis, earnings in the portfolio grew by 10%.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We use forecast earnings for only 11 companies to reflect an expected downturn in performance, and these accounted for 11% of the portfolio value.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And as you'd expect, we normally adjust valuation earnings for one-off costs of restructuring or acquisitions made in the period.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This time, we have also made an adjustment to earnings used the action, the largest Private Equity asset.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We increased its earnings to reflect the run rate of stores that are opened and operational in its successful rollout program.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Multiples have increased by 7% in the year, but the increase was lower in the fourth quarter, the market movements.",1364
18511,"2013m5","There were a number of factors driving that, including the specific mix of geographies, sectors and size and, in a few cases, a degree of caution about where longer cross-cycle multiples might be.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So how do these all variables translate into movements? Well, it's a significant change in dynamics that compared to last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Movements from earnings, performance and multiples of GBP 141 million and GBP 36 million, respectively, are positive.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The uplift to imminent sale includes a number of smaller assets, where deals have been signed and cash is effectively in transit, does not include Civica or Quintiles, both of which happened after our cut-off.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The negative DCF movement relates substantially to the Indian portfolio, and Simon has talked about the various challenges that we're experiencing in that geography.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Altogether, an unrealized profit of GBP 250 million, a very significant improvement on the loss of GBP 488 million of the prior period.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Of course, the critical thing is that unrealized value movements turn into realized profits.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And as Simon detailed earlier, we made good progress on that last year, and we've made a strong start in the first quarter.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And as a result, we're now well positioned to initiate distributions above the core level of dividend.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we expect to do that later in financial '14.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Subject to shareholder approval, the dividend in financial year '13 will be the core dividend, 8.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We'll pay a final dividend of 5.",1364
18511,"2013m5","4p in July.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So to sum up.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our results show a marked improvement compared to last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","They give you solid evidence of the cost reduction and balance sheet simplification.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Importantly, we're seeing signs that the asset management initiatives are driving better performance in Private Equity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And the growth agenda for Infrastructure and Debt Management is improving the core profitability of the group.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So in all, it's been a really busy year for everyone at 3i, and the numbers clearly show the progress that we're making.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I'll now hand you back to Simon.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Not unduly.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I think Civica was a very good example that we're experiencing again pretty strong financing conditions in Europe now, so funding is available again for Private Equity and investment industry.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And equally, we've got strong corporates with cash there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I think, while we've had a particular shape to our realizations in recent months, that's bound to change as we get on with the rest of the plant and the become evident.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I don't think -- I think the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","is particularly half but I think we're, the financing market is pretty good now as well.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's possible.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We still have a goal in 2 or 3 years time to raise a fund focused on our Northern European straight capability.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's interesting that Eurofund V, the fund that we raised at the top of the market and spent launch near the top of the market did improve from 0.",1364
18511,"2013m5","75 cost to 0.",1364
18511,"2013m5","91 cost over the last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","There is real momentum in terms of the recovery of value there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The vintages of '11 and '12 that are in that fund are performing particularly well, I would say.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You don't have to get very far over, one, to start getting into the second in the quartiles.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I'm ambitious for the team to really recover significant ground in that fund over the next few years, which will tie into when we want to raise a fund.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In the meantime, we have lots of capital to invest ourselves.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have these 2 arrangements and we could well have others.",1364
18511,"2013m5","There is 1 here.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Chris? It's Philip Middleton from Merrill's.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I wonder if you can talk through what you see the implications for your business, particularly, project would be if the current conditions of strong realizations, difficult investment continues for a year or 2, because obviously for a time you can carry on selling responsibly, which is what you're doing, you're not worry about the investment levels, at some point you have to worry about and I just wondered how you think about that? I think part of the shakeout going on in Private Equity is a reassessment by more experienced LPs as to how they want to gain exposure to this sector.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And many of the more sophisticated ones are looking at this type of arrangement in preference to being tied up in a general fund for 10 years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I do think that, that is part of this shift that is going on in the structural sense across the sector.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I don't think everyone is there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But I think some of the more sophisticated investors are moving to that as their preferred route for investment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","On infra, again, I think there is -- there's a little bit of investing environment in infra that we are seeing in Private Equity that its becoming a very fashionable and competitive area.",1364
18511,"2013m5","There are lots of people who see the attractions of Infrastructure investment in terms of its yield, profile, in particular, but we are -- we're looking at a number of things.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We're looking at new investments in terms of a stronger whip than we saw last year and some quite big stuff across Europe.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we're also working looking at buckets of assets that we could perhaps manage on behalf of other people because of the quality and the capabilities that we have within 3i in that sector.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So there's a number of different routes that we're looking at that the moment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I think on the -- taking the latter one first, on the distribution, Julia's indicated that we're going to focus on that later in the financial year '14.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have already made in an arithmetic terms EUR 422 million of gross realizations, which the 15% to 20% can be applied to.",1364
18511,"2013m5","If you do the arithmetic on that, it sort of accounts for, I guess, our base level of dividend.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So everything going forward now is going to represent arithmetic that will generate a special distribution.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have a strong pipeline of realizations in progress and to come.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I'm optimistic that we will be saying more about that towards the end of the year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I didn't get the phone call that you mentioned, although that was my mobile ringing, so that could have been him.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I was playing golf on Saturday morning, and I was having a sneaky cook breakfast in the clubhouse with my 3 playing parties away from my wife's disapproving look, when I got handed the FT on Saturday morning.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And there's an article in the FT that said ""FNC hit by big protest over pay.",1364
18511,"2013m5",""" And this was handed to me by a very senior board member of one of our largest and management groups who was in my board.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I just read the first 3 paragraphs of this.",1364

18511,"2013m5","Just a couple of questions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Just on the NAV.",1364

18511,"2013m5","Two questions, if I may.",1364

18511,"2013m5","Obviously, it's positive to see average 49% uplift to carrying value and realized gains of GBP 190 million in the year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You mentioned obviously the good selling environment for realizations currently, and you're taking good advantage of these conditions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","When I turned to Page 21 of this section 2 of our packet sent to us, we got Continental Europe's realizations falling from GBP 670 million to GBP 201 million, fall of 70% year-on-year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Does this concern you? On Infra, again, I think there is -- there's a little bit of the investing environment in Infra that we also seeing in Private Equity that it's becoming a very fashionable and competitive area.",1364
18511,"2013m5","There are lots of people who see the attractions of Infrastructure investment in terms of its yield, profile, in particular, but we are -- we're looking at a number of things.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We're looking at new investments in terms of a stronger whip than we saw last year and some quite big stuff across Europe.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we're also looking at buckets of assets that we could perhaps manage on behalf of other people because of the quality and the capabilities that we have within 3i in that sector.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So there's a number of different routes that we're looking at that the moment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Yes, and I think if you look in your pack, we've given you a slide to give you the shape of the balance sheet.",1364

18511,"2013m5","If you did a pro forma basis, by the end of next year, if you seem you had exactly the same balance sheet, we'll be about 22% hedged on the Euro portfolio and nowhere else.",1364

18511,"2013m5","I think it's a reflection of the changing shape of the portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We are going to look -- it's not that we're going to not manage our currency risk but we're going to do that on an entry point and an exit point, much more consistent with our focus on cash-to-cash returns.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's Henry Freeman from Investec.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Just following on from the question before on your new 2 strategic coinvestors.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Is this the kind of format that we could expect going forward for particularly Private Equity fund raising or cost fund raising, rather than raising money through traditional LP funds? And my other question was about the hedging policy.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I mean, after going hedged for a number of years, last year was clearly very good on the currency front.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Could you just detail a little bit more how that's change and what effective currency exposures are in the NAV level? I think part of the shakeout going on in Private Equity is a reassessment by more experienced LPs as to how they want to gain exposure to this sector.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And many of the more sophisticated ones are looking at this type of arrangement in preference to being tied up in a general fund for 10 years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I do think that, that is part of this shift that is going on in the structural sense across the sector.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I don't think everyone is there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But I think some of the more sophisticated investors are moving to that as their preferred route for investment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's possible.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We still have a goal in 2 or 3 years time to raise a fund focused on our Northern European straight North American capability.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's interesting that Eurofund V, the fund that we raised at the top of the market and spent largely at the top of the market did improve from 0.",1364
18511,"2013m5","75 cost to 0.",1364
18511,"2013m5","91 cost over the last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","There is real momentum in terms of the recovery of value there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The vintages of '11 and '12 that are in that fund are performing particularly well, I would say.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You don't have to get very far over, one, to start getting into the second and top quartiles.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I'm ambitious for the team to really recover significant ground in that fund over the next few years, which will tie into when we want to raise the fund.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In the meantime, we have lots of capital to invest ourselves.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have these 2 arrangements and we could well have others.",1364
18511,"2013m5","There is one here.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Chris? Thank you, Simon.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So you've just heard about the significant progress that we've been making against the strategic objectives that we set last June.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'd now like to take you through our financial results and show you the evidence of that progress, and I'd like to take you through the impact that, that progress will have on our financial year '14.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So in headline terms, the change is obvious.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have made growth portfolio return of GBP 546 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's driven by realizations that we've achieved, a good uplift to that opening value.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The cost of running the business is down to GBP 170 million, and that's including restructuring costs of GBP 30 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our balance sheet today is a lot stronger, with gross debt reduced to GBP 1.",1364
18511,"2013m5","1 billion and gearing down to 11%, and our NAV is much improved at 311p.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So this chart shows you how the NAV has improved.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The opening NAV has been reduced by dividends we paid during the year and by the cost of implementing our new strategy.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But strong realizations, good earnings growth and net fee income have been a big contributor of 41p, and 20p of that performance relates to cash realized profits.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And now that we report our NAV quarterly, here is the same reconciliation to the fourth quarter.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Here, you can see how the momentum has built in the year with an 8.",1364
18511,"2013m5","7% increase in NAV in the fourth quarter compared to 2.",1364
18511,"2013m5","5% in the preceding 3.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Before I get on to business performance, I'd just like to spend some time taking you through the changes in our cost base that Simon talked about.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Then we'll look at the balance sheet structure, which has also been an important change this year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Just to recap on the key metrics that Simon talked about earlier.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We said we reduced our run rate cost base by GBP 40 million by the 31st of March 2013.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've beaten our target by 28%, and we reduced the cost base by GBP 51 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We said we reduced headcount by 160 by the 31st of March 2013.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In fact, we reduced headcount by 168.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We said the actual cost for the year would be about the same level as the year before.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Actual cost is 6% lower.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That includes acquisition, as well as an GBP 8 million accounting benefit that we get from the bonus shares awarded as part of the compensation review, and that benefit will unwind over the next 3 to 4 years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's very good progress but it's a bit complicated by whether we're talking about including or excluding acquisitions or talking about run rate to actual costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","At the highest level, we started the year with a run rate cost base of GBP 185 million or 1.",1364
18511,"2013m5","8% of our assets under management.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've reduced the cost base by delivering annual savings of GBP 51 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","During the year, we added GBP 7 million to that cost base when the Debt Management business grew by acquiring Invesco contracts and the Fraser Sullivan platform.",1364
18511,"2013m5","These additional costs I'm talking about are covered by fees.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But here, we're looking at gross costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And that means we finished the year at 31st of March 2013, with the cost run rate of GBP 140 million or 1.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And how do we reconcile actual and run rate.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So here's the detailed reconciliation of the components, the adjustments for acquisitions and the full year effect of changes and savings.",1364
18511,"2013m5","One of the changes that we've talked about is the compensation review, and you can see here the change in the makeup of fixed and variable compensation this year compared to last.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Better performance has generated higher variable pay of the general bonus pool which reduced by 50% last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And there has been a step change in the amount of share awards to better align people with shareholders, the GBP 8 million cost of which will be accounted for over the next 3 to 4 years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And so to summarize the new targets.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We said the cost would reduce by GBP 45 million by the end of financial year 2014.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We're now resetting that goal to achieve total run rate savings of GBP 60 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We said the implementation costs would be GBP 30 million to achieve run rate savings of GBP 45 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And that we've spend GBP 30 million -- we've spent GBP 30 million to achieve savings of GBP 51 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We'll now spend another GBP 7 million to deliver the total of GBP 60 million savings that we've targeted.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Turning then to the balance sheet.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As Simon has already set out, we said that we would reduce gross debt to GBP 1 billion by June 2013.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Actual gross debt at the 31st of March was GBP 1.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Since then, we've repaid GBP 164 million of drawings under one of our committed facilities.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So at the end of April, gross debt is GBP 917 million, and that's substantially below the target and were ahead in timing as well.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our net interest payable is GBP 91 million, that's flat compared to last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And interest receivable has reduced as you'd expect with our lower cash balances.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The gross interest payable in financial year 2013 of GBP 97 million was modestly lower than the prior year of GBP 103 million, but significantly, this year's expense included GBP 25 million of accelerated interests cost that are associated with the early repayment of a number of tranches of our debt.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So since we accelerated the reduction of the gross debt position, we start financial year 2014 with a much simpler profile.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our liquidity is made up of cash of GBP 746 million, an undrawn committed facilities of GBP 336 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's before reflecting the repayments of the drawings just after the period end, which doesn't change liquidity but switches cash to undrawn.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've reviewed the level of equity that we have to hold, taking account of the lumpy nature of investment flows of fund commitments and the ongoing cost of running the business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Simon explained the 3i business model is now much simpler and there is a lot more central control.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That means the level of liquidity that we hold can be reduced.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But I expect that we will always want to maintain a minimum cash balance of about GBP 500 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our gross debt profile is now very simple.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Starting at the end of the chart and working back, we have a long-dated sterling bonds, which costs about GBP 35 million a year and our quality assets to pension funds who are searching for return and duration.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's GBP 280 million outstanding on our 2017 eurobond, which costs about GBP 60 million per year depending on FX.",1364
18511,"2013m5","If you take account of commitment fees on the undrawn facilities and other balance sheet-related costs, I am confident that the gross interest cost will be less than GBP 60 million in financial year 2014.",1364
18511,"2013m5","One final point to note on simplification.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have a more straightforward business model and that means a smaller number of assets, so we're changing the way that we manage currency risk.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Instead of hedging on a portfolio basis, currency risk management is now an explicit part of our investment and divestment decisions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Altogether, we have a much stronger balance sheet, with net debt reduced to GBP 335 million and gearing down to 11.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Of course, the reduction in net debt reflects the success of the business overall and our Private Equity business, in particular, in delivering strong realizations in the year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I'd now like to talk to you that business performance.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Simon has talked about how each business line contributes to the group performance, with a different emphasis on capital returns and fee income for each of those business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Clearly the most significant improvement has been in our Private Equity business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've generated very strong realized profits, good earnings growth and a reduction in operating costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Infrastructure and Debt Management have provided a stable contribution in the period.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'm going to talk briefly about those 2 businesses first.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our Infrastructure business invests in Europe and in India, and we are seeing a stark contrast in the performance in those 2 regions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So the modest loss of GBP 2 million shown here masks a GBP 24 million gain that we made on our 34% holding in 3i Infrastructure plc, offset by value reductions of GBP 27 million in the Indian portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","From a strategic perspective, Infrastructure business generated good cash return, through both portfolio income and fees.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Growing income profitably is the key strategic objective for our Debt Management business, and it's a capital-light business for the group.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have only invested GBP 46 million in this business in the year, with assets under management almost doubling to GBP 6.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We invested GBP 8 million to bring in the Fraser Sullivan platform, acquired the Invesco contracts and supported the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","team who have raised almost $1 billion of new capital in the second half.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We set Jeremy Ghose the target of growing fee income for the business to GBP 50 million in the next 3 to 5 years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The fees of GBP 31 million this year are a mixture of existing funds where improved credit performance has generated another GBP 6 million of catch-up fees after last year's GBP 11 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","New business has done only the further GBP 6 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So fees are good news but profitable growth is key.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And the net returns you see here are still modest.",1364
18511,"2013m5","However, there is quite a lot of accounting noise in the operating cost of the business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So it's worth noting of the GBP 32 million of cost shown here, GBP 8 million relates to acquisition accounting or due diligence costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'd now like to come on to the Private Equity business performance.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Private Equity accounts for 82% of our balance sheet investments, so strong results are a very important contributor to the growth in our NAV.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our realized profits of GBP 190 million and an uplift over opening value of 49% are evidence that the maturity of the portfolio has developed and that the increased focus on the exit plans is already generating results, and Simon has taken you through the significant assets generating this result.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'll come on to unrealized profits in a minute, because there's a few other points I want to note in the overall net return for this business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Portfolio income has fallen in the period.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's partly as a result of assets sold but also because of the effect of some restructuring and provisions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","However, the cash element of income was stable at GBP 39 million compared to GBP 40 million in the prior year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Fee income is also lower as expected in [ph] December 2012, and we have the full year effect of Eurofund V, which ended its investment period in November 2011.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Finally, we can also see here the benefit of cost reductions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The GBP 114 million includes GBP 23 million of restructuring costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Altogether, the businesses generated a net portfolio return of GBP 416 million or 15.",1364
18511,"2013m5","8%, and that's a significant improvement from the loss of GBP 441 million in the prior year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","A big driver of that change is due to portfolio valuation.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As you can see here, 81% of the portfolio is in Northern Europe, North America and Brazil, which is where our investment efforts are focused.",1364
18511,"2013m5","There have been no significant changes in sector mix.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And although the new vintages continue to grow as a proportion of the portfolio, we still have a majority, 58% by value, of the 2007, '08 and '09 vintages.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This part of the portfolio is beginning to perform more strongly, and we're now seeing a number of good exits, such as the recently announced Civica and Quintiles transactions, as well as Mold-Masters and Hyperion.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our continued focus on supporting investments that were made with high leverage and high energy prices remains critical.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've seen some significant increases in value in some of these businesses and a reduction in leverage, as operational improvements and refinancings come through.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The 20 assets shown here account for 62% of the Private Equity portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As you can see on the right, the direction of travel is improving but the majority of these companies, particularly the larger investments.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've excluded 5 large investments from this list for commercial reasons, but they also follow the general trend.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In terms of valuations, there are some consistent themes.",1364
18511,"2013m5","On a valuated basis, earnings in the portfolio grew by 10%.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We use forecast earnings for only 11 companies to reflect an expected downturn in performance, and these accounted for 11% of the portfolio value.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And as you'd expect, we normally adjust valuation earnings for one-off costs of restructuring or acquisitions made in the period.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This time, we have also made an adjustment to earnings used [indiscernible] Action, the largest Private Equity asset.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We increased its earnings to reflect the run rate of stores that are opened and operational in its successful rollout program.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Multiples have increased by 7% in the year, but the increase was lower in the fourth quarter, the market movements.",1364
18511,"2013m5","There were a number of factors driving that, including the specific mix of geographies, sectors and size and, in a few cases, a degree of caution about where longer cross-cycle multiples might be.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So how do all these variables translate into value movement? Well, it's a significant change in dynamics than compared to last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Movements from earnings, performance and multiples of GBP 141 million and GBP 36 million, respectively, are positive.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The uplift to imminent sale includes a number of smaller assets, where deals have been signed and cash is effectively in transit, it does not include Civica or Quintiles, both of which happened after our cut-off.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The negative DCF movement relates substantially to the Indian portfolio, and Simon has talked about the various challenges that we're experiencing in that geography.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Altogether, an unrealized profit of GBP 250 million, a very significant improvement on the loss of GBP 488 million of the prior period.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Of course, the critical thing is that unrealized value movements turn into realized profits.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And as Simon detailed earlier, we made good progress on that last year, and we've made a strong start in the first quarter.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And as a result, we're now well positioned to initiate distributions above the core level of dividend.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we expect to do that later in financial '14.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Subject to shareholder approval, the dividend in financial year '13 will be the core dividend, 8.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We'll pay a final dividend of 5.",1364
18511,"2013m5","4p in July.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So to sum up.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our results show a marked improvements in performance compared to last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","They give you solid evidence of the cost reduction and balance sheet simplification.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Importantly, we're seeing signs that the asset management initiatives are driving better performance in Private Equity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And the growth agenda for Infrastructure and Debt Management is improving the core profitability of the group.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So in all, it's been a really busy year for everyone at 3i, and the numbers clearly show the progress that we're making.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I'll now hand you back to Simon.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Daniel Garrod, Barclays.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Couple of questions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","First on the 4 buckets of investments that you referred to.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You've obviously done well, realizing out of the #2, the sort of strong performers.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I wonder if you could go to the fourth bracket that you called the 0s.",1364
18511,"2013m5","How many assets are in that category, and can you provide any sort of color on the experience with enterprise about the possibles sort of hidden value creation in that element of your portfolio? The second question is around the statements this morning of the new committed coinvestments from a number of institutions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I wonder if you could provide any more color on that on a number of institutions, whether there's any change in fees? You, obviously, mentioned you get fees and carry on those potential new investments, coinvestments, with those institutions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Is there any change in fee structure of those coinvestments compared to, say, your Eurofund V? Thanks, Julia.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So we've had a productive year at 3i, and we're changing into a tightly run business with a target of generating annual income, profits and cash flows to be used for shareholder returns and reinvestment, without the large elements of leakage that we've seen in recent years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We see the group as having 2 parts: Proprietary capital, which is about generating portfolio income and capital profits; and fund management, which manages both the proprietary capital and third-party capital in return for fee income, carried interest and performance fees.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Going forward, you will be able to track our progress and performance, not only as a group, but you'll be able to measure our use of proprietary capital, as well as our performance as a fund manager.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We are convinced that this greater transparency will be crucial in judging how we are doing.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As I said earlier, each of our 3 businesses has different drivers and return characteristics, but together, they provide an attractive balance of income and capital returns.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And the combination of our 3 asset management skills, together with our permanent capital, provides us with a differentiated model just at the time when the private equity sector is going for a very fundamental shakeup.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The first phase of our turnaround plan has gone well, and we've exceeded all of our targets, and we're already seeing the benefits in materially improved financial performance.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And as I said earlier, we have a new set of priorities for this year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Now I'll try and communicate this plan, and our performance, as clearly and as simply as possible.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But don't be fooled into thinking, all we are doing is just taking out a few costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This project is far more complicated than that, and it's required a lot of careful judgment after some very detailed analysis.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The business is multilayered with important fund and LP commitments over many years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","3i's geographically diverse and employs many senior, experienced and independent-minded investment professionals.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's got an oversized PE portfolio to match its geographic diversity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And the asset management initiatives are critical to optimizing value from these and from future investments.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In short, the business requires relentless leadership and cut-through to make sure everybody stays on track, and we avoid the banana skins of the past.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That having been said, I'd like to just close by saying thank you to the team at 3i.",1364
18511,"2013m5","They've responded very well to some tough actions this year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I really admire the determined way they picked up their game and risen to the challenges that have been put in front of them.",1364
18511,"2013m5","When I first stood up as CEO last June and presented our new strategy, I talked about a few things that I believe underpin strong businesses: A clear vision guiding an ambitious but practical strategy; integrity and respect for individuals, be they colleagues, customers or suppliers; high energy levels and a good work ethic; and clear decisions based on thorough analysis, followed by rapid implementation.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Today's 3i team has embraced this approach with real enthusiasm.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The culture is changing, and we become a better focused, flatter organization with a can-do attitude and high-energy levels.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We're doing things smartly again, and I'm excited about the progress we will make over the next few years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's going to be rewarding for everyone involved.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Thank you for listening.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we'd now like to throw it open to Q&A.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Bill Barnard from SG.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Should I assume your first call from this morning with Mr.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Bramson's thank you for making him so much money, and in terms of making him some more money, can you sort of give a bit more color around your thoughts on sort of a top-up distribution in terms of the quantum, the relationship, the 15% to 20% and, indeed, any timing sort of this year, next year, et cetera, just sort of key variables we should look around there? Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Just a couple of questions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Just on the NAV.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Obviously, there are a number of deals you did around quite recently.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'm just trying to get a feel for what's not been included on the 31st of March NAV, and what are kind of pro forma NAV might look like? It's Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I've got a couple.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Firstly, on the unrealized volume movements on Slide 57.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I think the second largest contributor was other, plus GBP 73 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Now can you just give us a bit of a breakdown on that? And then the second one was on Infrastructure.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I think you said there was a good business opportunity there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I was just wondering what the plans are for growing that business, clearly, I think conditions probably couldn't be more favorable than they are today for the asset class, so what are the plans to grow assets under management? It's Philip Middleton from Merrill's.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I wonder if you can talk through what you see the implications for your business, and particularly in project would be if the current conditions of strong realizations, difficult investment continues for a year or 2, because obviously -- for a time you can carry on selling responsibly, which is what you're doing and not worry about the investment levels, at some point you have to worry about and I just wondered how you think about that? If we look at how the market is developing and the pipeline in terms of potential investments, the comments I would make are, over the last 6 months, we've seen a very considerable improvements in pipeline potential investments.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It have been very lean prior to that period, particularly in terms of quality, as well as quantity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So we've seen some better prospects in Northern Europe, as well as the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","and Brazil.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We think these prospects are more interesting for both numerous and quality reasons.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we've got pretty close on 2 investments in Europe, one we couldn't agree a final price with the vendor so we decided to pull back from that.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It was an engineering business based out of Germany.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And another business in Holland, we got overbid at the last stage of an auction with a very aggressive price from another Private Equity house.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So we are there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We are in the game.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have a better whip in Brazil and the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","at the moment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","whip is particularly interesting, and it reflects businesses that we like, which have strong capabilities in both Europe and North America, like HILITE like Element.",1364
18511,"2013m5","These sorts of businesses.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I don't think we're going to see a prolonged phase where we're doing just selling and not investing.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I don't envisage that at all.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In any event, though, what I'd like to see in terms of the shape of the group is that we have about half the Private Equity investments we have today.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So we're on a bit of a journey to reduce that oversized portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We need to be more active on that side of things.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I think the next few years will help us in that regard.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Not unduly.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I think Civica was a very good example that we're experiencing, again, pretty strong financing conditions in Europe now, so funding is available again for the Private Equity and investment industry.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And equally, we've got strong corporates with cash there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I think, while we've had a particular shape to our realizations in recent months, that's bound to change as we get on with the rest of the plans and they become evident.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I don't think -- I think the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","is particularly hot but I think Europe, the financing market, is pretty good now as well.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I think on the -- taking the latter one first, on the distribution, Julia's indicated that we're going to focus on that later in financial year '14.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have already made in an arithmetic terms EUR 422 million of gross realizations, which the 15% to 20% can be applied to.",1364
18511,"2013m5","If you do the arithmetic on that, it sort of accounts for, I guess, our base level of dividend.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So everything going forward now is going to represent arithmetic that will generate a special distribution.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have a strong pipeline of realizations in progress and to come.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I'm optimistic that we will be saying more about that towards the end of the year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I didn't get the phone call that you mentioned, although that was my mobile ringing, so that could have been him.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I was playing golf on Saturday morning, and I was having a sneaky cooked breakfast in the clubhouse with my 3 playing parties away from my wife's disapproving look, when I got handed the FT on Saturday morning.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And there's an article in the FT that said ""F&C hit by big protest over pay.",1364
18511,"2013m5",""" And this was handed to me by a very senior board member of one of our largest fund management groups who was in my [indiscernible].",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I'll just read the first 3 paragraphs [ph] of this.",1364
18511,"2013m5","F&C asset management, the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","'s worst-performing listed fund management group, had suffered a large protest over company pay yesterday and lost another big investor.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Some 25% of votes cast did not back the company's remuneration report for 2012 over concerns about the performance of the group, which is struggled to attract new business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The big protest was one of the largest among FTSE 250 companies recently, and sent the company share price tumbling and made worries about more investor defections.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I've got that.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I was ribbed about that as I was teeing off.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I've sort of look at the share price performance since Mr.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Bramson became Chairman of F&C, and I've looked at the activities of here [ph].",1364
18511,"2013m5","and I'm afraid I just don't get it.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I know he's named as his target company in various publications whose shell vehicle has put out, but he hasn't communicated with us and I really don't understand it.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So that's all I can say, Bill.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Good morning, everyone.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's almost 1 year since I stood up in June 2012 to take you through the future strategy of 3i and our restructuring plan.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'm pleased to say that we've made very significant and rapid progress in implementing our plan.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our strong set of results for the year, which show material improvement across the board against 2012, clearly demonstrate the progress that we've made.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've delivered against all of the priorities we set ourselves for the financial year ending March 2013 and, in particular, we've materially exceeded our cost and debt reduction targets.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've seen considerable improvement in our Private Equity performance, including an impressive run of cash realizations.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In short, it's been a very good year of recovery for 3i after too many disappointing ones.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I'd like to start by focusing on our strategic objectives and progress over the last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Julia will take you through the groups financial performance, and I will then make some concluding remarks before I'd open to Q&A.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But first, I'd like to remind you about our strategy.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's simple and embraces all 3 of our businesses: Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The combination of our complementary asset management capabilities across these 3 platforms, together with our permanent capital, gives our investors a differentiated and attractive value proposition.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our 3 businesses are each different in terms of drivers and return characteristics, but they complement each other, and together, they're capable of providing an interesting balance of income and capital growth.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You will have seen this slide before.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It captures the key return drivers for each of our businesses, as well as demonstrating their cyclicality.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Now I've bought shares in 3i because, after analyzing the fundamentals of the group and its prospects, it was clear to me that the business, if ran well, represented a compelling multiyear value proposition.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I was convinced that this value proposition was underpinned by valuable portfolio of investments and by the prospect of significant cash distributions over time.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Today, everybody at 3i sees the simplicity of growing the earnings of our portfolio, realizing our investments at attractive cash multiples, generating annual cash profits by running our 3 fund management businesses well, using our permanent capital to take advantage of value and growth opportunities, and turning this into cash for the benefit of LPs shareholders.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I hope it all sounds very simple, but it's actually taken quite a lot of hard work and careful thought to begin delivering on this strategy and moving 3i on to the solid footing it's on today.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've had to put in some fundamental new asset management initiatives in Private Equity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've refocused that division and put a real emphasis on exit planning and smart execution.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Across our businesses, we are focusing on growing third-party AUM and growing our income against the rightsized cost base.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've used our capital to exploit opportunities in the debt management sector, and we've reduced gross debt and our cost of funding, so that more of the cash goes back to shareholders and back to the business to be invested.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our multiyear value build is based on a number of different phases of organizational change and strategic delivery.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've delivered all of the strategic priorities we set for the financial year 2013.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we're already progressing well in transition and delivery, the next phase of our plan.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You will recall that we set ourselves 6 strategic objectives last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I'd now like to take you through our progress against each in a little more detail.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Last June, we said we'd reduce our headcount by 160 by the 31st of March.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In fact, we achieved a net headcount reduction of 168.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's almost 40% of the group's headcount that we had in March last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we closed the 6 offices we said we would, and we reduced our property expenses even further by making significant rental savings in both London and New York.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We originally targeted annualized cost savings of GBP 40 million by March '13 and, in fact, we cut out GBP 51 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That puts us 28% ahead of our target and also represents, coincidentally, a 28% reduction to our opening costs of GBP 185 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Over 70% of the staff reduction has come from the back office.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's 119 out of the 168.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As a result, we have a better balance of investment staff versus back-office support.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And this slide gives you an idea of where the headcount reduction has taken place.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Geography has determined the reductions in the investment teams with finance, admin, property, IT, HR and marketing accounting for the 119 staff reductions in the group functions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And here's a little more detail on where we've over-performed in cost reductions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This slide gives you some examples of how further savings have come about.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In general, we have found additional savings through a sharper focus on cost control and by introducing much stronger approval mechanisms across the group.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've also delayered to become a simple, less hierarchical organization.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As a result of our progress up to March 2013, we're today announcing a material increase in our cost reduction target for this current financial year to March 2014.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We're moving our total cost reduction target up to GBP 60 million from the original GBP 45 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So that represents a like-for-like reduction of almost 1/3 against our cost base of GBP 185 million in March last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As to the benefits of the changes we've already implemented take place, and we continue to manage the business tightly, we will see further reductions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we'll be doing this at the same time that we're making sure that we have the right platform and the right level of support to grow our Debt Management and Infrastructure businesses.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we've delivered another material win around the balance sheet.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Having set the target of GBP 1 billion of gross debt by June '13, we bought it down to close to GBP 900 million by April.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's a reduction of 44% from our starting position of over GBP 1.",1364
18511,"2013m5","6 billion in March last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And that's a clear reflection of our success in realizing from our Private Equity portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","An important part of restructuring over the last year has been to achieve a greater degree of central control and focus.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And to get there, we've removed organizational complexity and bureaucracy.",1364
18511,"2013m5","By removing committees and hierarchies, we've created a much more efficient organization.",1364
18511,"2013m5","When you combine that simplification with a more energized team, you can create a much more dynamic culture.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And that's exactly what we've done, a simple organization with shorter lines of communication leads to much faster and more consistent decision-making.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And that in turn is driving improved performance.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In June last year, we announced 6 new asset management initiatives in Private Equity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That program has now been substantially implemented and is beginning to make a huge difference to the quality of our asset management in Private Equity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You've seen some of this already with our realization successes and the improvement in the overall portfolio value, and we expect to see further benefits over time.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've also refined our investment review process.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've combined our separate investment and portfolio committee structures under one Investment Committee, which I chair.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The new Investment Committee considers all decisions from original investment ideas, right through to divestment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've also involved the Investment Committee early on in the investment process, and we've involved it in all material decisions in the life of an investment, such as refinancing and senior management changes.",1364
18511,"2013m5","With the geographic breadth and sheer scale of the 3i investment portfolio, I'm convinced these changes are critical.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've tied up our processes on asset management -- on management assessment, rather, and we made our approach consistent across all our investing teams.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we've become much more proactive in replacing underperforming management.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Since September last year, we've replaced 11 Chairmen and CEOs after our proper evaluation of their performance.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And as most of you will recall, the introduction of the 3i dashboard last September has transformed how quickly we recognize and react to performance issues within our portfolio of companies.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's working very well, and it's leading to new improved asset management performance across the entire portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Since March last year, we've increased the emphasis on developing detailed exit strategies for all our Private Equity investments.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We review and update those plans twice a year, with a view to optimizing cash proceeds for shareholders and LPs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","If an investment is ready to be sold, we'll take advantage of market conditions, but equally, we're prepared to think if there is better value down the road, or that we should -- we're prepared to consider refusing a cheap offer or waiting for better value down the road.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You've recently seen the results of this planning and execution with the sales of Mold-Masters and Civica and with plans for each asset in our Private Equity portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In some cases, those plans were announced a number of years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In other cases, we have like -- companies likely to be sold in the near term.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's been an excellent year for realizations.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've generated a total of GBP 575 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's an uplift of 49% over the opening book value and a money multiple of 2.",1364
18511,"2013m5","1x against our initial investment, not a bad performance in my book.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'd also like to remind you again that I believe cash is the best measure of the performance of our investments.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I also feel that, in many cases, a focus on our current NAV fails to recognize the likely future or auction value for each of the investments we have and that we've set out in our individual exit plans.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I hope our recent sales are convincing you that we've got this right.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We can achieve good premium offers when the financing markets are robust as they are right now.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We refocused our Private Equity business around Northern Europe, the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","and Brazil.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've suspended new investments in Asia and Spain, and we're highly selective in the core regions we are investing in.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's no secret that this has been a difficult environment for investing.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And while we found some investing opportunities in Brazil, we've struggled to get comfortable with the pricing in Northern Europe, in particular.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So in this environment, we're delighted to be more focused on selling.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As most of you know, it has been a really good selling environment with strong financial markets and plenty of cash-rich private equity and corporate buyers.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I think it's fair to say that our recent record shows that we are taking good advantage of these conditions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The next slide I showed you last June, the Private Equity portfolio has traded well in a generally very difficult macro environment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've had resilient performances in Northern Europe, the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","and Brazil, some very tough conditions in Spain, and a rapid deterioration in the environment in France and some very tough conditions in India.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And when I review the Private Equity portfolio, I think about it in 4 buckets.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The keepers, e.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Action, Element, Mayborn, which offer terrific long-term growth.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Second is the strong performers, which we expect to good -- achieve good sales proceeds, like Civica, like Mold-Masters, which I mentioned just a minute ago.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The third bucket is made up of those investments which have the potential for material value recovery from where they have historically traded, companies such as Xellia, Azelis and OneMed.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And finally, what I call the 0s, which account for little of our NAV today, but represent auction value, in the case of the enterprise value, recovers above the level of the debt.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The company enterprise was a good example of this category.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The third bucket is our largest bucket by cost of investments and has significant scope to increase value over time.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As you know, we conducted the group-wide compensation review this year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","At around 60% of operating costs, the payroll is our largest expense.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've got to make sure we have a legitimate split of returns between shareholders and employees.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's the only way we can retain both the right talent and create long-term shareholder value.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have had broad shareholders support for our new proposals.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And these new compensation arrangements are to be introduced in June 2013.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Going forward, group compensation will be driven by how we perform against our key strategic objectives.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This will give us a much clearer link between staff compensation and shareholder returns.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In addition, a lot bigger proportion of total compensation will be in deferred shares of 3i Group plc.",1364
18511,"2013m5","For example, senior staff in the group will have a shareholding target, which will be set as a multiple of annual gross salary, so that we can enhance our alignment with shareholders.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We're already making strong progress in the next phase of our strategic plan, transition and delivery.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And this slide shows our key objectives for the year ahead.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We expect cash income to cover operating cost by March 2014 on a run rate basis.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And by the way, 3i has not done that for a very long time, to lead to a more balanced contribution to third-party fee income over time.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In Private Equity, we focus on finding the best way to reestablish our investment track record.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've done that by investing alongside institutional coinvestors in Brazil and establishing 2 framework agreements for investing in Northern Europe.",1364
18511,"2013m5","One of these agreements is with a leading U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","institution and one is with a very large sovereign wealth fund.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Infrastructure continue to make a strong contribution to the group's cash income last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The European portfolio performed well, and the value of the holding in 3i Infrastructure increased by 7%.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We did see some pullback in the valuations of some of our Indian assets, given the challenging supply-side and macroeconomic conditions we face in India.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've got one of the best teams in the Infrastructure sector, and our pipeline in European opportunities is good going into this financial year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we, therefore, expect to see good growth.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our Debt Management business has had a very strong year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","They've almost doubled third-party funds under management to GBP 6.",1364
18511,"2013m5","They also acquired a very strong U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","franchise in Fraser Sullivan and issued almost 1 billion of CLOs in the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The business has a very experienced group of credit professionals and is well-placed to take advantage of further opportunities as this sector continues to change.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This financial year, we intend to pursue our enhanced capital distribution policy.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've already met our goals for gearing of less than 20% and gross debt below GBP 1 billion.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We intend to distribute 15% to 20% of gross cash proceeds in the next 12 months, and the GBP 222 million from Mold-Masters is going to be part of this calculation, and all other realizations this year will contribute.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The current total, including Mold-Masters and realizations announced so far, is GBP 422 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So our priorities for the year are clear: To realize fully the benefits from the Private Equity asset management initiatives, continue to grow Debt Management and Infrastructure's third-party businesses, and look for new investments in Private Equity using proprietary capital and third-party coinvestors.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We'll further reduce our operating and funding costs and fully implement our new compensation arrangements.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So clearly, it's been a good year for 3i.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I'd now like to ask Julia to take you through the numbers.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Well, we're limited of what we can say about that.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That is a process that we're exploring at the moment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I think scanned [ph] lines trading is very resilient, it's a highly cash generative business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's a bit of a strange business, because it's sort of part -- Private Equity part, part Infrastructure.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's one of those businesses because of its cash flow characteristics, it could be on bucket 1 or bucket 2.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's that solid of business, but you'll hear more about them in due course, I'm sure.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Yes, I think if you look in the disclosure that we gave you on the valuation of the assets, the 2 principal ones to talk about, the Civica and Quintiles, neither of which were on an uplift to sale basis at the end of the period.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Quintiles was valued at GBP 103 million that we announced, that we've received GBP 50 million of proceeds and residual holding is worth GBP 133 million based on the IPO price.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Share price has actually gone up since then, but I'm not sort of calculating it on a daily basis.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And Civica is the other example, which is in the books at GBP 84 million at the end of March.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we disclosed proceeds on that asset of GBP 127 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I think actually that both good examples of what this realization market is like.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We strike a fair value for our assets.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I clearly have cited some of these processes, but that's one factor that we take into account, we take into account a degree of execution risk.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And it's one of the reasons why we would say that the NAV won't ever really reflect the very, very good M&A conditions that we're currently seeing at the moment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Okay, why don't I take the last bit first.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In terms of those arrangements, firstly, it's not discretionary money.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That money is there if they like the investment in question.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But these 2 institutions have been long-term investors with 3i in a number of structures, and we know each other extremely well, and they've been very active investors with the past.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So we have a high degree of confidence that they like what we like and they rate the current team, which is why they've entered into these framework agreements.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The economics of these framework agreements are equivalent to invested money economics in a more general buyout fund.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So they don't pay commitment fees, but they will pay deal fees, management fees and carry to the team in return for good performance there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So they're very similar to invested money in a fund.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The taste of the 2 is a little different.",1364
18511,"2013m5","One likes to hit boundaries, fours and sixes in terms of the checks it writes.",1364
18511,"2013m5","On the other ones to have a slice of most of our deals with smaller checks.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So they're complementary in that regard.",1364
18511,"2013m5","They obviously don't want their name disclosed at this point.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But I think it will become evident as we invest who they are.",1364
18511,"2013m5","If we just talk about the 0s, it's quite a numerous -- it's a too numerous bucket, I'm afraid.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I don't know the exact number, but there's quite a lot of them, and enterprise was the most relevant recent example of that, and I'm sure some of them will be recovering above their base value.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But it will be single digits and millions or tens of millions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It won't be hundreds of millions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And yes, what we typically have in the other category are companies, which are valued on a different sort of basis.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So the majority of our portfolio is valued on an earnings basis.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have some companies, which be involved on industry metrics, for example, Hyperion is an example of that, that we've seen.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And of course, ACR would be another example.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So it's a multitude of things.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And just finally, on scanned [ph] lines, can you give us some color on the recent trading performance there? And I guess if I put it another way, is that ship still there, sailing ahead? So you'd expect to add a few more of these sort of strategic coinvestors? Any other questions? I've got to get to the [indiscernible] AGM, so I'm going to wrap it up here.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Thanks for coming everyone, and we'll take questions later in the day if you want.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's Rob Jones from Liberum Capital.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Two questions, if I may.",1364
18511,"2013m5","First one, realizations.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Obviously, it's positive to see average 49% uplift to carrying value and realized gains of GBP 190 million in the year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You mentioned, obviously, it's a good selling environment for realizations, currently, and you're taking good advantage of these conditions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","When I turned to Page 21 of this section 2 of our pack sent [ph] to us, we got Continental Europe's realizations falling from GBP 670 million to GBP 201 million, fall of 70% year-on-year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Does this concern you? I think on the -- taking the latter one first, on the distribution, Julia's indicated that we're going to focus on that later in financial year '14.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have already made, in arithmetic terms, GBP 422 million of gross realizations, which the 15% to 20% can be applied to.",1364
18511,"2013m5","If you do the arithmetic on that, it sort of accounts for, I guess, our base level of dividend.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So everything going forward now is going to represent arithmetic that will generate a special distribution.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have a strong pipeline of realizations in progress and to come.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I'm optimistic that we will be saying more about that towards the end of the year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I didn't get the phone call that you mentioned, although that was my mobile ringing, so that could have been him.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I was playing golf on Saturday morning, and I was having a sneaky cooked breakfast in the clubhouse with my 3 playing parties away from my wife's disapproving look, when I got handed the FT on Saturday morning.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And there was an article in the FT that said ""F&C hit by big protest over pay.",1364
18511,"2013m5",""" And this was handed to me by a very senior board member of one of our largest fund management groups who was in my fourball.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I'll just read the first 3 paras of this.",1364
18511,"2013m5","F&C asset management, the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","'s worst-performing listed fund management group, had suffered a large protest over company pay yesterday and lost another big investor.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Some 25% of votes cast did not back the company's remuneration report for 2012 over concerns about the performance of the group, which has struggled to attract new business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The big protest was one of the largest among FTSE 250 companies recently, and sent the company share price tumbling and made worries about more investor defections.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I've got that.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I was ribbed about that as I was teeing off.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I've sort of looked at the share price performance since Mr.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Bramson became Chairman of F&C, and I've looked at the activities of here [ph].",1364
18511,"2013m5","and I'm afraid I just don't get it.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I know he's named us his target company in various publications his shell vehicle has put out, but he hasn't communicated with us and I really don't understand it.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So that's all I can say, Bill.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And just finally, on scanned [ph] lines, can you give us some color on the recent trading performance there? And I guess if I put it another way, is that ship still there, sailing ahead? Well, we're limited of what we can say about that.",1364

18511,"2013m5","Firstly, on the unrealized volume movements on Slide 57.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I think the second largest contributor was Other, plus GBP 73 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Now can you just give us a bit of a breakdown on that? And then the second one was on Infrastructure.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I think you said there was a good business opportunity there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I was just wondering what the plans are for growing that business, clearly, I think conditions probably couldn't be more favorable than they are today for that asset class, so what are the plans to grow assets under management? Bill Barnard from SG.",1364

18511,"2013m5","Bramson to thank you for making him so much money, and in terms of making him some more money, can you sort of give a bit more color around your thoughts on sort of a top-up distribution in terms of the quantum, the relationship, the 15% to 20% and, indeed, any timing sort of this year, next year, et cetera, just sort of key variables we should look around there? Thank you, Simon.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So you've just heard about the significant progress that we've been making against the strategic objectives that we set last June.",1364

18511,"2013m5","So in headline terms, the change is obvious.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have made growth portfolio return of GBP 546 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's driven by realizations that we've achieved, a good uplift to the opening value.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The cost of running the business is down to GBP 170 million, and that's including restructuring costs of GBP 30 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our balance sheet today is a lot stronger, with gross debt reduced to GBP 1.",1364
18511,"2013m5","1 billion and gearing down to 11%, and our NAV is much improved at 311p.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So this chart shows you how the NAV has improved.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The opening NAV has been reduced by dividends we paid during the year and by the cost of implementing our new strategy.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But strong realizations, good earnings growth and net fee income have been a big contributor at 41p, and 20p of that performance relates to cash realized profits.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And now that we report our NAV quarterly, here is the same reconciliation for the fourth quarter.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Here, you can see how the momentum has built in the year with an 8.",1364
18511,"2013m5","7% increase in NAV in the fourth quarter compared to 2.",1364
18511,"2013m5","5% in the preceding 3.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Before I get on to business performance, I'd just like to spend some time taking you through the changes in our cost base that Simon talked about.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Then we'll look at the balance sheet structure, which has also been an important change this year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Just to recap on the key metrics that Simon talked about earlier.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We said we'd reduce our run rate cost base by GBP 40 million by March 31, 2013.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've beaten that target by 28%, and we've reduced the cost base by GBP 51 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We said we'd reduce headcount by 160 by the 31st of March 2013.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In fact, we reduced headcount by 168.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We said the actual cost for the year would be about the same level as the year before.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Actual cost is 6% lower.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That includes acquisitions, as well as an GBP 8 million accounting benefit that we get from the bonus shares awarded as part of the compensation review, and that benefit will unwind over the next 3 to 4 years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's very good progress, but it's a bit complicated by whether we're talking about including or excluding acquisitions or talking about run rate to actual costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","At the highest level, we started the year with a run rate cost base of GBP 185 million or 1.",1364
18511,"2013m5","8% of our assets under management.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've reduced the cost base by delivering annual savings of GBP 51 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","During the year, we added GBP 7 million to that cost base when the Debt Management business grew by acquiring Invesco contracts and the Fraser Sullivan platform.",1364
18511,"2013m5","These additional costs I'm talking about are covered by fees.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But here, we're looking at gross costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And that means we finished the year, at March 31, 2013, with a cost run rate of GBP 140 million or 1.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And how do we reconcile actual and run rate? So here's the detailed reconciliation of the components, the adjustments for acquisitions and the full year effect of changes and savings.",1364
18511,"2013m5","One of the changes that we've talked about is the compensation review, and you can see here the change in the makeup of fixed and variable compensation this year compared to last.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Better performance has generated higher variable pay as the general bonus pool which reduced by 50% last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And there has been a step change in the amount of share awards to better align people with shareholders, the GBP 8 million cost of which will be accounted for over the next 3 to 4 years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And so to summarize the new targets.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We said that costs would reduce by GBP 45 million by the end of financial year 2014.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We're now resetting that goal to achieve total run rate savings of GBP 60 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We said the implementation costs would be GBP 30 million to achieve run rate savings of GBP 45 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And that we'd spend GBP 30 million -- we've spent GBP 30 million to achieve savings of GBP 51 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We'll now spend another GBP 7 million to deliver the total of GBP 60 million savings that we've targeted.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Turning then to the balance sheet.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As Simon has already set out, we said that we would reduce gross debt to GBP 1 billion by June 2013.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Actual gross debt at the 31st of March was GBP 1.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Since then, we've repaid GBP 164 million of drawings under one of our committed facilities.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So at the end of April, gross debt is GBP 917 million, and that's substantially below the target and we're ahead in timing as well.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our net interest payable is GBP 91 million, that's flat compared to last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And interest receivable has reduced as you'd expect with our lower cash balances.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The gross interest payable in financial year 2013 of GBP 97 million was modestly lower than the prior year of GBP 103 million, but significantly, this year's expense included GBP 25 million of accelerated interest costs that are associated with the early repayment of a number of tranches of our debt.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So since we accelerated the reduction of the gross debt position, we start financial year 2014 with a much simpler profile.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our liquidity is made up of cash of GBP 746 million and undrawn committed facilities of GBP 336 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's before reflecting the repayments of the drawings just after the period end, which doesn't change liquidity but switches cash to undrawn.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've reviewed the level of liquidity that we have to hold, taking account of the lumpy nature of investment flows, our fund commitments and the ongoing costs of running the business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Simon explained the 3i business model is now much simpler and there is a lot more central control.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That means the level of liquidity that we hold can be reduced.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But I expect that we will always want to maintain a minimum cash balance of about GBP 500 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our gross debt profile is now very simple.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Starting at the end of the chart and working back, we have our long-dated sterling bonds, which costs about GBP 35 million a year and our quality assets, the pension funds who are searching for return and duration.",1364
18511,"2013m5","There's GBP 280 million outstanding on our 2017 eurobond, which costs about GBP 60 million per year depending on FX.",1364
18511,"2013m5","If you take account of commitment fees on the undrawn facilities and other balance sheet-related costs, I am confident that the gross interest cost will be less than GBP 60 million in financial year 2014.",1364
18511,"2013m5","One final point to note on simplification.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have a more straightforward business model and that means a smaller number of assets, so we're changing the way that we manage currency risk.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Instead of hedging on a portfolio basis, currency risk management is now an explicit part of our investment and divestment decisions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Altogether, we have a much stronger balance sheet, with net debt reduced to GBP 335 million and gearing down to 11.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Of course, the reduction in net debt reflects the success of the business overall and our Private Equity business in particular, in delivering strong realizations in the year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I'd now like to talk through that business performance.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Simon has talked about how each business line contributes to the group performance, with a different emphasis on capital returns and fee income for each of those business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Clearly the most significant improvement has been in our Private Equity business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've generated very strong realized profits, good earnings growth and a reduction in operating costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Infrastructure and Debt Management have provided a stable contribution in the period.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'm going to talk briefly about those 2 businesses first.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our Infrastructure business invests in Europe and in India, and we've seen a stark contrast in the performance in those 2 regions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So the modest loss of GBP 2 million shown here masks a GBP 24 million gain that we made on our 34% holding in 3i Infrastructure plc, offset by value reductions of GBP 27 million in the Indian portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","From a strategic perspective, Infrastructure business generated good cash return, through both portfolio income and fees.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Growing income profitably is the key strategic objective for our Debt Management business, and it's a capital-light business for the group.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have only invested GBP 46 million in this business in the year, with assets under management almost doubling to GBP 6.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We invested GBP 8 million to bring in the Fraser Sullivan platform, acquired the Invesco contracts and supported the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","team who have raised almost $1 billion of new capital in the second half.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We set Jeremy Ghose the target of growing fee income for the business to GBP 50 million in the next 3 to 5 years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The fees of GBP 31 million this year are a mixture of existing funds where improved credit performance has generated another GBP 6 million of catch-up fees after last year's GBP 11 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","New business has then added a further GBP 6 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So fees are good news but profitable growth is key.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And the net returns you see here are still modest.",1364
18511,"2013m5","However, there is quite a lot of accounting noise in the operating cost of the business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So it's worth noting of the GBP 32 million of cost shown here, GBP 8 million relates to acquisition accounting or due diligence costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'd now like to come on to the Private Equity business performance.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Private Equity accounts for 82% of our balance sheet investments, so strong results are a very important contributor to the growth in our NAV.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our realized profits of GBP 190 million and an uplift over opening value of 49% are evidence that the maturity of the portfolio has developed and that the increased focus on the exit plans is already generating results, and Simon has taken you through the significant assets generating this result.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'll come on to unrealized profits in a minute, because there's a few other points I want to note in the overall net return for this business.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Portfolio income has fallen in the period.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's partly as a result of assets sold but also because of the effect of some restructuring and provisions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","However, the cash element of income was stable at GBP 39 million compared to GBP 40 million in the prior year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Fee income is also lower, as expected
[Audio Gap]
December 2012, and we have the full year effect of Eurofund V, which ended its investment period in November 2011.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Finally, we can also see here the benefit of cost reductions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The GBP 114 million includes GBP 23 million of restructuring costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Altogether, the businesses generated a net portfolio return of GBP 416 million or 15.",1364
18511,"2013m5","8%, and that's a significant improvement from the loss of GBP 441 million in the prior year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","A big driver of that change is due to portfolio valuation.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As you can see here, 81% of the portfolio is in Northern Europe, North America and Brazil, which is where our investment efforts are focused.",1364
18511,"2013m5","There have been no significant changes in sector mix.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And although the newer vintages continue to grow as a proportion of the portfolio, we still have a majority, 58% by value, of the 2007, '08 and '09 vintages.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This part of the portfolio is beginning to perform more strongly, and we're now seeing a number of good exits, such as the recently announced Civica and Quintiles transactions, as well as Mold-Masters and Hyperion.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our continued focus on supporting investments that were made with high leverage and high energy prices remains critical.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've seen some significant increases in value in some of these businesses and a reduction in leverage, as operational improvements and refinancings come through.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The 20 assets shown here account for 62% of the Private Equity portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As you can see on the right, the direction of travel is improving for the majority of these companies, particularly the larger investments.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've excluded 5 large investments from this list for commercial reasons, but they also follow the general trend.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In terms of valuations, there are some consistent themes.",1364
18511,"2013m5","On a valuated basis, earnings in the portfolio grew by 10%.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We use forecast earnings for only 11 companies to reflect an expected downturn in performance, and these accounted for 11% of the portfolio value.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And as you'd expect, we normally adjust valuation earnings for one-off costs of restructuring or acquisitions made in the period.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This time, we have also made an adjustment to earnings used [indiscernible] Action, the largest Private Equity asset.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We increased its earnings to reflect the run rate of stores that are opened and operational in its successful rollout program.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Multiples have increased by 7% in the year, but the increase was lower in the fourth quarter, the market movements.",1364
18511,"2013m5","There were a number of factors driving that, including the specific mix of geographies, sectors and size and, in a few cases, a degree of caution about where longer cross-cycle multiples might be.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So how do all these variables translate into value movement? Well, it's a significant change in dynamics than compared to last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Movements from earnings, performance and multiples of GBP 141 million and GBP 36 million, respectively, are positive.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The uplift to imminent sale includes a number of smaller assets, where deals have been signed and cash is effectively in transit, it does not include Civica or Quintiles, both of which happened after our cut-off.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The negative DCF movement relates substantially to the Indian portfolio, and Simon has talked about the various challenges that we're experiencing in that geography.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Altogether, an unrealized profit of GBP 250 million, a very significant improvement on the loss of GBP 488 million of the prior period.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Of course, the critical thing is that unrealized value movements turn into realized profits.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And as Simon detailed earlier, we made good progress on that last year, and we've made a strong start in the first quarter.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And as a result, we're now well positioned to initiate distributions above the core level of dividend.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we expect to do that later in financial '14.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Subject to shareholder approval, the dividend in financial year '13 will be the core dividend, 8.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We'll pay a final dividend of 5.",1364
18511,"2013m5","4p in July.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So to sum up.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our results show a marked improvements in performance compared to last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","They give you solid evidence of the cost reduction and balance sheet simplification.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Importantly, we've seen signs that the asset management initiatives are driving better performance in Private Equity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And the growth agenda for Infrastructure and Debt Management is improving the core profitability of the group.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So in all, it's been a really busy year for everyone at 3i, and the numbers clearly show the progress that we're making.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I'll now hand you back to Simon.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So you'd expect to add a few more of these sort of strategic coinvestors? Not unduly.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I think Civica was a very good example that we're experiencing, again, pretty strong financing conditions in Europe now, so funding is available again for the Private Equity and investment industry.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And equally, we've got strong corporates with cash there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I think, while we've had a particular shape to our realizations in recent months, that's bound to change as we get on with the rest of the plans and they become evident.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I don't think -- I think the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","is particularly hot but I think Europe, the financing markets are pretty good now as well.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's Henry Freeman from Investec.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Just following on from the question before on your new 2 strategic coinvestors.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Is this the kind of format that we could expect going forward for, particularly, Private Equity fund raising or quasi fund raising, rather than raising money through traditional LP funds? Thanks, Julia.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So we've had a productive year at 3i, and we're changing into a tightly run business with a target of generating annual income, profits and cash flows to be used for shareholder returns and reinvestment, without the large elements of leakage that we've seen in recent years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We see the group as having 2 parts: Proprietary capital, which is about generating portfolio income and capital profits; and fund management, which manages both the proprietary capital and third-party capital in return for fee income, carried interest and performance fees.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Going forward, you will be able to track our progress and performance, not only as a group, but you'll be able to measure our use of proprietary capital, as well as our performance as a fund manager.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We are convinced that this greater transparency will be crucial in judging how we are doing.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As I said earlier, each of our 3 businesses has different drivers and return characteristics, but together, they provide an attractive balance of income and capital returns.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And the combination of our 3 asset management skills, together with our permanent capital, provides us with a differentiated model just at a time when the private equity sector is going for a very fundamental shakeup.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The first phase of our turnaround plan has gone well, and we've exceeded all of our targets, and we're already seeing the benefits in materially improved financial performance.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And as I said earlier, we have a new set of priorities for this year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Now I'll try and communicate this plan, and our performance, as clearly and as simply as possible.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But don't be fooled into thinking all we are doing is just taking out a few costs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This project is far more complicated than that, and it has required a lot of careful judgment after some very detailed analysis.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The business is multilayered with important fund and LP commitments over many years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","3i is geographically diverse and employs many senior, experienced and independent-minded investment professionals.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's got an oversized PE portfolio to match its geographic diversity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And the asset management initiatives are critical to optimizing value from these and from future investments.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In short, the business requires relentless leadership and cut-through to make sure everybody stays on track, and we avoid the banana skins of the past.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That having been said, I'd like to just close by saying thank you to the team at 3i.",1364
18511,"2013m5","They've responded very well to some tough actions this year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I really admire the determined way they picked up their game and risen to the challenges that have been put in front of them.",1364
18511,"2013m5","When I first stood up as CEO last June and presented our new strategy, I talked about a few things that I believe underpin strong businesses: A clear vision guiding an ambitious but practical strategy; integrity and respect for individuals, be they colleagues, customers or suppliers; high energy levels and a good work ethic; and clear decisions based on thorough analysis, followed by rapid implementation.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Today's 3i team has embraced this approach with real enthusiasm.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The culture is changing, and we've become a better focused, flatter organization with a can-do attitude and high-energy levels.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We're doing things smartly again, and I'm excited about the progress we will make over the next few years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's going to be rewarding for everyone involved.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Thank you for listening.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we'd now like to throw it open to Q&A.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Just a couple of questions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Just on the NAV.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Obviously, there are a number of deals you did around quite recently.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'm just trying to get a feel for what's not been included on the March 31 NAV, and what a kind of pro forma NAV might look like? On Infra, again, I think there is -- there's a little bit of the investing environment in Infra that we are seeing in Private Equity, that it's becoming a very fashionable and competitive area.",1364
18511,"2013m5","There are lots of people who see the attractions of Infrastructure investment in terms of its yield, profile, in particular, but we are -- we're looking at a number of things.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We're looking at new investments in terms of a stronger whip than we saw last year and some quite big stuff across Europe.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we're also looking at buckets of assets that we could perhaps manage on behalf of other people because of the quality and the capabilities that we have within 3i in that sector.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So there's a number of different routes that we're looking at, at the moment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And my other question was about the hedging policy.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I mean, after going hedged [ph] for a number of years, last year was clearly very good on the currency front.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Could you just detail a little bit more how that's change and what effective currency exposures are in the NAV level? Yes, and I think if you look in your pack, we've given you a slide to give you the shape of the balance sheet.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This is a forward-looking change that we're making.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have -- we're about 50% hedged on the euro at the moment, 40% on the dollar.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And essentially, we will let the derivative program run off over the course of the year, matching it to some of our investment flows.",1364
18511,"2013m5","If you did a pro forma basis, by the end of next year, if you assumed you had exactly the same balance sheet, we'll be about 22% hedged on the Euro portfolio and nowhere else.",1364
18511,"2013m5","If you want a rule of thumb, and I'd caution you against using it, because it's going to be dependent on the makeup of the portfolio and all those sorts of things, but a 1% movement in the Euro is about GBP 10 million on NAV and a 1% movement on the dollar is about GBP 7 million today.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I think it's a reflection of the changing shape of the portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We are going to look -- it's not that we're going to not manage our currency risk but we're going to do that on an entry point and an exit point, much more consistent with our focus on cash-to-cash returns.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's Rob Jones from Liberum Capital.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Two questions, if I may.",1364
18511,"2013m5","First one, on realizations.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Obviously, it's positive to see average 49% uplift to carrying value and realized gains of GBP 190 million in the year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You mentioned, obviously, it's a good selling environment for realizations, currently, and you're taking good advantage of these conditions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","When I turned to Page 21 of the section 2 of our pack in front of us, we've got Continental Europe's realizations falling from GBP 670 million to GBP 201 million, a fall of 70% year-on-year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Does this concern you? It's possible.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We still have the goal in 2 or 3 years time to raise a fund focused on our Northern European/North American capability.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's interesting that Eurofund V, the fund that we raised at the top of the market and spent largely at the top of the market did improve from 0.",1364
18511,"2013m5","75 cost to 0.",1364
18511,"2013m5","91 cost over the last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","There is real momentum in terms of the recovery of value there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The vintages of '11 and '12 that are in that fund are performing particularly well, I would say.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You don't have to get very far over 1 to start getting into the second and top quartiles.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I'm ambitious for the team to really recover significant ground in that fund over the next few years, which will tie into when we want to raise the fund.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In the meantime, we have lots of capital to invest ourselves.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have these 2 arrangements and we could well have others.",1364
18511,"2013m5","There is one here.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Chris? It's Philip Middleton from Merrill's.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I wonder if you can talk through what you see the implications for your business, and particularly in private equity would be, if the current conditions of strong realizations, difficult investment continues for a year or 2, because obviously -- for a time you can carry on selling responsibly, which is what you're doing and not worry about the investment levels, at some point you have to worry about them and I just wondered how you think about that? I think part of the shakeout going on in Private Equity is a reassessment by more experienced LPs as to how they want to gain exposure to this sector.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And many of the more sophisticated ones are looking at this type of arrangement in preference to being tied up in a general fund for 10 years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I do think that, that is part of this shift that is going on in the structural sense across the sector.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I don't think everyone is there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But I think some of the more sophisticated investors are moving to that as their preferred route for investment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","If we look at how the market is developing and the pipeline in terms of potential investments, the comments I would make are, over the last 6 months, we've seen a very considerable improvement in pipeline potential investments.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It had been very lean prior to that period, particularly in terms of quality, as well as quantity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So we've seen some better prospects in Northern Europe, as well as the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","and Brazil.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We think these prospects are more interesting for both numerous and quality reasons.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we've got pretty close on 2 investments in Europe, one we couldn't agree a final price with the vendor so we decided to pull back from that.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It was an engineering business based out of Germany.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And another business in Holland, we got overbid at the last stage of an auction with a very aggressive price from another Private Equity house.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So we are there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We are in the game.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have a better whip in Brazil and the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","at the moment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","whip is particularly interesting, and it reflects businesses that we like, which have strong capabilities in both Europe and North America, like HILITE, like Element.",1364
18511,"2013m5","These sorts of businesses.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I don't think we're going to see a prolonged phase where we're doing just selling and not investing.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I don't envisage that at all.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In any event, though, what I'd like to see in terms of the shape of the group is that we have about half the Private Equity investments we have today.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So we're on a bit of a journey to reduce that oversized portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We need to be more active on that side of things.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I think the next few years will help us in that regard.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And yes, what we typically have in the other category are companies, which are valued on a different sort of basis.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So the majority of our portfolio is valued on an earnings basis.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have some companies, which would be involved on industry metrics, for example, Hyperion is an example of that, that we've seen.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And of course, ACR would be another example.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So it's a multitude of things.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Okay, why don't I take the last bit first.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In terms of those arrangements, firstly, it's not discretionary money.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That money is there if they like the investment in question.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But these 2 institutions have been long-term investors with 3i in a number of structures, and we know each other extremely well, and they've been very active investors with the past.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So we have a high degree of confidence that they like what we like and they rate the current team, which is why they've entered into these framework agreements.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The economics of these framework agreements are equivalent to invested money economics in a more general buyout fund.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So they don't pay commitment fees, but they will pay deal fees, management fees and carry to the team in return for good performance there.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So they're very similar to invested money in a fund.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The taste of the 2 is a little different.",1364
18511,"2013m5","One likes to hit boundaries, fours and sixes in terms of the checks it writes.",1364
18511,"2013m5","On the other ones to have a slice of most of our deals with smaller checks.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So they're complementary in that regard.",1364
18511,"2013m5","They obviously don't want their name disclosed at this point.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But I think it will become evident as we invest who they are.",1364
18511,"2013m5","If we just talk about the 0s, it's quite a numerous -- it's a too numerous bucket, I'm afraid.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I don't know the exact number, but there's quite a lot of them, and enterprise was the most relevant recent example of that, and I'm sure some of them will be recovering above their base value.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But it will be single digits and millions or tens of millions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It won't be hundreds of millions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Good morning, everyone.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's almost 1 year since I stood up in June 2012 to take you through the future strategy of 3i and our restructuring plan.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'm pleased to say that we've made very significant and rapid progress in implementing that plan.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our strong set of results for the year, which show material improvement across the board against 2012, clearly demonstrate the progress that we've made.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've delivered against all of the priorities we set ourselves for the financial year ending March 2013 and, in particular, we've materially exceeded our cost and debt reduction targets.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've seen considerable improvement in our Private Equity performance, including an impressive run of cash realizations.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In short, it's been a very good year of recovery for 3i after too many disappointing ones.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I'd like to start by focusing on our strategic objectives and progress over the last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Julia will take you through the group's financial performance and I will then make some concluding remarks and throw it open to Q&A.",1364
18511,"2013m5","But first, I'd like to remind you about our strategy.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's simple and embraces all 3 of our businesses: Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The combination of our complementary asset management capabilities across these 3 platforms, together with our permanent capital, gives our investors a differentiated and attractive value proposition.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our 3 businesses are each different in terms of drivers and return characteristics, but they complement each other, and together, they're capable of providing an interesting balance of income and capital growth.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You will have seen this slide before.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It captures the key return drivers for each of our businesses, as well as demonstrating their cyclicality.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Now I bought shares in 3i because after analyzing the fundamentals of the group and its prospects, it was clear to me that the business, if run well, represented a compelling multiyear value proposition.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I was convinced that this value proposition was underpinned by valuable portfolio of investments and by the prospect of significant cash distributions over time.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Today, everybody at 3i sees the simplicity of growing the earnings of our portfolio, realizing our investments at attractive cash multiples, generating annual cash profits by running our 3 fund management businesses well, using our permanent capital to take advantage of value and growth opportunities, and turning this into cash for the benefit of LPs shareholders.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I hope it all sounds very simple, but it's actually taken quite a lot of hard work and careful thought to begin delivering on this strategy and moving 3i on to the solid footing it's on today.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've had to put in some fundamental new asset management initiatives in Private Equity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've refocused that division and put a real emphasis on exit planning and smart execution.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Across our businesses, we are focusing on growing third-party AUM and growing our income against the rightsized cost base.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've used our capital to exploit opportunities in the debt management sector, and we've reduced gross debt and our cost of funding, so that more of the cash goes back to shareholders and back to the business to be invested.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our multiyear value build is based on a number of different phases of organizational change and strategic delivery.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've delivered all of the strategic priorities we set for the financial year 2013.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we're already progressing well in transition and delivery, the next phase of our plan.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You will recall that we set ourselves 6 strategic objectives last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So I'd now like to take you through our progress against each in a little more detail.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Last June, we said we'd reduce our headcount by 160 by the 31st of March.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In fact, we achieved a net headcount reduction of 168.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's almost 40% of the group's headcount that we had in March last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we closed the 6 offices we said we would, and we reduced our property expenses even further by making significant rental savings in both London and New York.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We originally targeted annualized cost savings of GBP 40 million by March '13 and, in fact, we cut out GBP 51 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That puts us 28% ahead of our target and also represents, coincidentally, a 28% reduction to our opening costs of GBP 185 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Over 70% of the staff reduction has come from the back office.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's 119 out of the 168.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As a result, we have a better balance of investment staff versus back-office support.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And this slide gives you an idea of where the headcount reduction has taken place.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Geography has determined the reductions in the investment teams with finance, admin, property, IT, HR and marketing accounting for the 119 staff reductions in the group functions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And here's a little more detail on where we've over-performed in cost reductions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This slide gives you some examples of how further savings have come about.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In general, we have found additional savings through a sharper focus on cost control and by introducing much stronger approval mechanisms across the group.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've also delayered to become a simple, less hierarchical organization.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As a result of our progress up to March 2013, we're today announcing a material increase in our cost reduction target for this current financial year to March 2014.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We're moving our total cost reduction target up to GBP 60 million from the original GBP 45 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So that represents a like-for-like reduction of almost 1/3 against our cost base of GBP 185 million in March last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As the benefits of the changes we've already implemented take place, and we continue to manage the business tightly, we will see further reductions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we'll be doing this at the same time that we're making sure that we have the right platform and the right level of support to grow our Debt Management and Infrastructure businesses.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we've delivered another material win around the balance sheet.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Having set the target of GBP 1 billion of gross debt by June '13, we brought it down to close to GBP 900 million by April.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's a reduction of 44% from our starting position of over GBP 1.",1364
18511,"2013m5","6 billion in March last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And that's a clear reflection of our success in realizing from our Private Equity portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","An important part of restructuring over the last year has been to achieve a greater degree of central control and focus.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And to get there, we've removed organizational complexity and bureaucracy.",1364
18511,"2013m5","By removing committees and hierarchies, we've created a much more efficient organization.",1364
18511,"2013m5","When you combine that simplification with a more energized team, you can create a much more dynamic culture.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And that's exactly what we've done, a simple organization with shorter lines of communication leads to much faster and more consistent decision-making.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And that in turn is driving improved performance.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In June last year, we announced 6 new asset management initiatives in Private Equity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That program has now been substantially implemented and is beginning to make a huge difference to the quality of our asset management in Private Equity.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You've seen some of this already with our realization successes and the improvements in the overall portfolio value, and we expect to see further benefits over time.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've also refined our investment review process.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've combined our separate investment and portfolio committee structures under one Investment Committee, which I chair.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The new Investment Committee considers all decisions from original investment ideas, right through to divestment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've also involved the Investment Committee earlier on in the investment process, and we've involved it in all material decisions in the life of an investment, such as refinancing and senior management changes.",1364
18511,"2013m5","With the geographic breadth and sheer scale of the 3i investment portfolio, I'm convinced these changes are critical.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've tightened up our processes on asset management -- on management assessment, rather, and we made our approach consistent across all our investing teams.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we've become much more proactive in replacing underperforming management.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Since September last year, we've replaced 11 Chairmen and CEOs after a proper evaluation of their performance.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And as most of you will recall, the introduction of the 3i dashboard last September has transformed how quickly we recognize and react to performance issues within our portfolio of companies.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's working very well, and it's leading to new improved asset management performance across the entire portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Since March last year, we've increased the emphasis on developing detailed exit strategies for all our Private Equity investments.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We review and update those plans twice a year, with a view to optimizing cash proceeds for shareholders and LPs.",1364
18511,"2013m5","If an investment is ready to be sold, we'll take advantage of market conditions, but equally, we're prepared to think if there is better value down the road, or that we should -- we're prepared to consider refusing a cheap offer or waiting for better value down the road.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You've recently seen the results of this planning and execution with the sales of Mold-Masters and Civica and we have plans for each asset in our Private Equity portfolio.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In some cases, those plans run out a number of years.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In other cases, we have like -- companies likely to be sold in the near term.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's been an excellent year for realizations.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've generated a total of GBP 575 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's an uplift of 49% over the opening book value and a money multiple of 2.",1364
18511,"2013m5","1x against our initial investment, not a bad performance in my book.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I'd also like to remind you again that I believe cash is the best measure of the performance of our investments.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I also feel that, in many cases, a focus on our current NAV fails to recognize the likely future or auction value for each of the investments we have and that we've set out in our individual exit plans.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I hope our recent sales are convincing you that we've got this right.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We can achieve good premium offers when the financing markets are robust as they are right now.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We refocused our Private Equity business around Northern Europe, the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","and Brazil.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've suspended new investments in Asia and Spain, and we're highly selective in the core regions we are investing in.",1364
18511,"2013m5","It's no secret that this has been a difficult environment for investing.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And while we found some investing opportunities in Brazil, we've struggled to get comfortable with the pricing in Northern Europe, in particular.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So in this environment, we're delighted to be more focused on selling.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As most of you know, it has been a really good selling environment with strong financial markets and plenty of cash-rich private equity and corporate buyers.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I think it's fair to say that our recent record shows that we are taking good advantage of these conditions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The next slide I showed you last June.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The Private Equity portfolio has traded well in a generally very difficult macro environment.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've had resilient performances in Northern Europe, the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","and Brazil, some very tough conditions in Spain, and a rapid deterioration in the environment in France and some very tough conditions in India.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And when I review the Private Equity portfolio, I think about it in 4 buckets.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The keepers, e.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Action, Element, Mayborn, which offer terrific long-term growth.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Second is the strong performers, which we expect to good -- achieve good sales proceeds, like Civica, like Mold-Masters, which I mentioned just a minute ago.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The third bucket is made up of those investments which have the potential for material value recovery from where they have historically traded, companies such as Xellia, Azelis and OneMed.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And finally, what I call the 0s, which account for little of our NAV today, but represent option value, in the case that the enterprise value recovers above the level of the debt.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The company, Enterprise, was a good example of this category.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The third bucket is our largest bucket by cost of investments and has significant scope to increase value over time.",1364
18511,"2013m5","As you know, we conducted a group-wide compensation review this year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","At around 60% of operating costs, the payroll is our largest expense.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've got to make sure we have a legitimate split of returns between shareholders and employees.",1364
18511,"2013m5","That's the only way we can retain both the right talent and create long-term shareholder value.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We have had broad shareholder support for our new proposals.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And these new compensation arrangements are to be introduced in June 2013.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Going forward, group compensation will be driven by how we perform against our key strategic objectives.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This will give us a much clearer link between staff compensation and shareholder returns.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In addition, a lot bigger proportion of total compensation will be in deferred shares of 3i Group plc.",1364
18511,"2013m5","For example, senior staff in the group will have a shareholding target, which will be set as a multiple of annual gross salary, so that we can enhance our alignment with shareholders.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We're already making strong progress in the next phase of our strategic plan, transition and delivery.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And this slide shows our key objectives for the year ahead.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We expect cash income to cover operating cost by March 2014 on a run rate basis.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And by the way, 3i has not done that for a very long time, to lead to a more balanced contribution to third-party fee income over time.",1364
18511,"2013m5","In Private Equity, we focused on finding the best way to reestablish our investment track record.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've done that by investing alongside institutional coinvestors in Brazil and establishing 2 framework agreements for investing in Northern Europe.",1364
18511,"2013m5","One of these agreements is with a leading U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","institution and one is with a very large sovereign wealth fund.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Infrastructure continued to make a strong contribution to the group's cash income last year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The European portfolio performed well, and the value of the holding in 3i Infrastructure increased by 7%.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We did see some pullback in the valuations of some of our Indian assets, given the challenging supply-side and macroeconomic conditions we face in India.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've got one of the best teams in the Infrastructure sector, and our pipeline in European opportunities is good going into this financial year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And we, therefore, expect to see good growth.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Our Debt Management business has had a very strong year.",1364
18511,"2013m5","They've almost doubled third-party funds under management to GBP 6.",1364
18511,"2013m5","They also acquired a very strong U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","franchise in Fraser Sullivan and issued almost 1 billion of CLOs in the U.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The business has a very experienced group of credit professionals and is well-placed to take advantage of further opportunities as this sector continues to change.",1364
18511,"2013m5","This financial year, we intend to pursue our enhanced capital distribution policy.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We've already met our goals for gearing of less than 20% and gross debt below GBP 1 billion.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We intend to distribute 15% to 20% of gross cash proceeds in the next 12 months, and the GBP 222 million from Mold-Masters is going to be part of this calculation, and all other realizations this year will contribute.",1364
18511,"2013m5","The current total, including Mold-Masters and realizations announced so far, is GBP 422 million.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So our priorities for the year are clear: To realize fully the benefits from the Private Equity asset management initiatives, continue to grow Debt Management and Infrastructure's third-party businesses, and look for new investments in Private Equity using proprietary capital and third-party coinvestors.",1364
18511,"2013m5","We'll further reduce our operating and funding costs and fully implement our new compensation arrangements.",1364
18511,"2013m5","So clearly, it's been a good year for 3i.",1364
18511,"2013m5","And I'd now like to ask Julia to take you through the numbers.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Daniel Garrod, Barclays.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Couple of questions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","First on the 4 buckets of investments that you referred to.",1364
18511,"2013m5","You've obviously done well, realizing out of the #2, the sort of strong performers.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I wonder if I could go to the fourth bracket that you called the 0s.",1364
18511,"2013m5","How many assets are in that category, and can you provide any sort of color on the experience with enterprise about the possibles sort of hidden value creation in that element of your portfolio? The second question is around the statements this morning of the new committed coinvestments from a number of institutions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","I wonder if you could provide any more color on that on a number of institutions, whether there's any change in fees? You obviously mentioned you get fees and carry on those potential new investments, coinvestments, with those institutions.",1364
18511,"2013m5","Is there any change in fee structure of those coinvestments compared to, say, your Eurofund V?",1364
18511,"2014m11","Let me try and answer those 2 questions.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I think my words of caution are really focused on the macro uncertain countries and the volatility in the financial markets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","They're not focused on the performance of our companies in buckets 1 and 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have very good momentum in most of those companies, and as I said in my words, that are sort of companies who can cope with a difficult environment, and that's what we're seeing.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So there's no start whining about that aspect portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","To the second point, the bigger and a newer companies tend to be heavily represented in buckets 1 and 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So that's where the value is.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That's where the stronger momentum is.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A lot of the '07, '08 type companies are in buckets 3 and 4, if I were to generalize in that way.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Nothing report recently is in buckets 4, I can assure you that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Just on the new investments, to what extent did your new coinvestors take part in those? Yes, it's one my favorite jobs, it's tracking the FX movements on a daily basis, and we have recruited quite a bit since the end of September.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The last time I look it was about GBP 27 million had reversed.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We haven't given you the sensitivity.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Again, in the pack, I think it's on Slide 51 where you can see 1% movement in the currency just based on the net assets of 30th of September.",1395
18511,"2014m11","On the multiples, as you said, excluding Action, which as I explained, we didn't move the multiple.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's one of our highest multiples in the valuations at 12.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5x on a post-discount basis, and it's our largest Private Equity asset, so holding that flat with the value going up pushes the multiple average including it.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And elsewhere, we have been doing this for a while.",1395
18511,"2014m11","When we look at the concepts that we're choosing, we're looking at a number of factors, things that you'd expect, the right sector, the absolute size of the company, its relative performance, the levels of leverage.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And they're pretty bespoke now in terms of how we can adjust that comp set that we trying to value tickets all the more important is the top 20 is 77% of the values, so it make sense be quite precise in the way that we do that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Because of that I can't really give you sort of a thematic in this sector, we've taken this approach.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have absolutely looked at some of our businesses where we have a view about likely exit multiple and as we've seen the market moved away at the beginning of this calendar year, we've effectively kept that multiple.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It doesn't mean we'll hold the multiples completely flat, and as I mentioned in a couple of stronger cases of our assets, we treat multiples up slightly where they completed the refinancing or where they made some progress with the transformation.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And we've had a number of multiples that have gotten down in the period as well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it's quite a mixture, but the strong performance has kept the multiples overall flat.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Thanks, Julia.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have some mics for Q&A, so this is being recorded, so if you could wake from mic and then say your name and give us your question.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Daniel? I think it was reflective of the asset value at March and under the asset value at September.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Any more questions? Yes, one at the front.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And just another question.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Could you disclose what sort of price asset value was paid for the stake in Eurofund V? Philip? Well, I think we've put some general caution out there about the economies across Europe, in particular, and maybe if I can touch on that and then talk about the investments specifically.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We're seeing quite a mixed bag of performance, so we find that our portfolios in Germany and Benelux are doing well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Germany, we think the economy in the shape of the companies we have has proved quite resilience.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In Benelux, we're very exposed into the discount sectors, so whether it's Basic-Fit or whether it's Action, it's the right part of that market to be in because it's quite a tough market at that time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Scandinavia is a mixed bag.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We think Sweden is pretty strong at the moment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's quite like the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11",", we would suggest.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Whereas Finland is really struggling.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So Finland we think is really weaken and has deteriorated as has France.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There's been a marked deterioration in our view in France this year, particularly from late spring, early summer.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And we don't see any change in that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So that's why we were particularly pleased to come out of DG in the way that we did.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Spain, we still think it's a difficult economy.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's better than it was, but nothing easy in Spain.",1395
18511,"2014m11","2 strong economies would be North America, in particular, and the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","-- and the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And in terms of looking at where we're putting money to the work, what we're seeing at the moment is more attractive pricing generally in North America than in Europe because there's a better balance of supply of targets in the States than there is here at the moment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we can hunt in the middle of America for these nice industrial companies that we're quite good at and find those processes are very much less competitive than anything good that happens to come up in Continental Europe.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Krist played to us because people could see we had a degree of synergies with our existing jewelry investment in Germany, and therefore, we put off competing for that asset.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So that was a very sensible purchase at this time, of a very good business.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it's harder to find stuff of value in your about the moment, I would say, needs more attractive in the States.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to 3i's Interim Results.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've had another good first half, with solid results across the group.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Despite the tricky macro and volatile stock markets, we're building real value growth across our investment portfolios.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We see a good level of realization activity, and we made some important new investments in North America and Germany.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And we have made good progress with group KPIs, with further reductions in operating and interest costs.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've also delivered the growing base of cash realizations to underpin this year's dividend.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We secured GBP 324 million of realizations in the first half and another GBP 218 million of cash since then, including the successful placing of some of our stock in Quintiles last week.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The portfolio has performed well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In fact, we've seen GBP 360 million of value growth and income based on strong earnings momentum in our larger investments, such as Action and Element.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Operating costs are now running at 1% of AUM compared to 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","6% in 2012.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That's very much in line with or better than industry benchmarks, and this has helped in increasing our first half Fund Management profit of GBP 13 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now as you know, I took over as CEO in May 2012, and we announced the new strategy for the group in June 2012.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Well, we've come along the way since then, and I'm pleased to say there is very strong momentum in the group today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Even with adverse foreign currency markets, we've produced a good recovery in total returns underpinned by strong asset management and realization performance, a substantial reduction in cost and much improved cash flow.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That's the stuff that pays dividends to shareholders and cash back to LPs.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You should now all be familiar with our strategy.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's simple and it includes all 3 of our businesses.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The combination of our complementary asset management capabilities across 3 platforms, together with our permanent capital, gives our shareholders a clearly differentiated and attractive value proposition.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now I'd like to use the 3i Value Build, which we first presented in 2012, as the structure for today's presentation.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I'll comment on each of the steps starting with portfolio earnings.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Here are the 4 3i buckets which are used to analyze the Private Equity portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I've set down some examples for each bucket and the percentage of value using the 30th of September values that each bucket accounts for.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Back in May 2012, 3i had 130 investments, with too many in buckets 3 and 4.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we've been on a journey with the aim of reducing that number of investments down to 40 or less, with those 40 comprising the 2 stronger buckets, 1 and 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've had another good run of realizations, and the majority of which have come from our non-core buckets 3 and 4.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So the overall portfolio is increasingly dominated by our keepers or higher-value potential assets in bucket 1 or our strong performance in bucket 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In fact, the value weighted average LTM earnings growth of 17% across the portfolio is driven by the strong growth we are seeing across our larger investments in buckets 1 and 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","While our companies in the top 2 buckets are more able to cope with a challenging macro climate, it is not always the case for those companies in buckets 3 and 4.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The strong market for realizations, which is underpinned by QE and lots of dry powder of potential buyers, has meant we've been able to trade out a number of our weaker or non-core companies at attractive valuations.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our mid-market P portfolio has good earnings momentum, which compares very favorably with stock market comparables or indeed other PE portfolios and will underpin significant cash distributions from the group over the coming years.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've overhauled our approach to asset management in 2012 and introducing 6 new initiatives and much greater productivity across the portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","These changes, which encompass our monthly dashboard monitoring and more rigorous exit planning, are an important factor in the resilient performance of the portfolio we're seeing today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And I thought this would be a useful time to look at the investments we made last year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We made 4 investments, 3 new and 1 large follow-on in Scandlines.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And despite the competition for good assets, we bought them well at attractive entry multiples, an average across the floor of 8x EBITDA.",1395
18511,"2014m11","All are performing in line or ahead of plan, with average earnings growth of 23% over the last 12 months.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And I'd now like to give you a look at each of those investments.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Gift is a gem in testing and engineering business focused on transmission systems in the automotive sector.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We know the testing in automotive sectors extremely well, and Gift is a classic German Mittelstand business.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our long-term plan is to reposition the business as much more of a pure-play testing business, with the value-added engineering capability and to continue its drive for international expansion.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The plan is going well, with the business expecting to generate EBITDA growth of 25% for the current financial year and a good buildup of sales in the China operation, in particular.",1395
18511,"2014m11","JMJ is a global leader in safety consultancy and works for major oil, industrial and aerospace companies around the world.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The business is based out of Austin, Texas, but it has a U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It is a sector leader and is capable of significant international expansion as well as growing through entering new sectors.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It enjoyed strong levels of organic growth and has a very blue-chip roster of major clients such as Chevron, Shell and Lendlease.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The business was introduced to us by the Chairman of Element, which gave us the chance to buy the company away from an auction process.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now I talked about Basic-Fit last year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's our discount gym format in the Benelux.",1395
18511,"2014m11","If you like, it's our action of the gym world.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Again, we purchased Basic-Fit away from a competitive process and have enjoyed some spectacular growth in the company's first year under our ownership, with 42 new clubs and the likely increase of over 50% in EBITDA this year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We're now the market leader in both Holland and Belgium and have just started to open gyms in France and Spain.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So our new investments are performing well, and we have sensible in-prices against which to target our money multiple returns.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Gift and JMJ our classic bucket 2 investments, and it's already pretty clear the Basic-Fit is more likely to be a bucket 1 candidate.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've delivered another good round of realizations and refinancing in the first half, and Julia will be giving more detail on this in her section.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've continued to focus on this pulseless of non-core assets with just 1 sale from bucket 2 in the first half and another 2 highlight LHI closing last month.",1395
18511,"2014m11","At the 30th of September, we have reduced the number of investments to 72.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now I'd also like to talk about 2 of those bucket 2 disposals, the DG highlight.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The DG, a French hospital group, was sold in September to CVC, netting 3i GBP 83 million of proceeds and a 2x money multiple in 4 years.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now France is a very difficult market at present, and our Paris team did a great job in securing this exit on these terms.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We made a 48% profit over our March 14 book value on this sale.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Highlights, a German automotive group in which we bought in 2011 was another classic bucket 2 asset.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We refocused the group investing in R&D and expanding geographic sales through China, in particular.",1395
18511,"2014m11","1x our money through a very competitive auction process, eventually selling to a Chinese company, Avic Electromechanical Systems, at the end of October.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now moving to the group.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our operating cash profit continued it's been improving trajectory in the first half at GBP 60 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That reflects a further reduction in the cost base and improving income performance across our 3 businesses.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Debt Management has made a good contribution to net income.",1395
18511,"2014m11","To date, they've issued 4 CLOs, 2 in the U.",1395

18511,"2014m11","The Infrastructure team has also had a productive first half, seeing strong growth in its core European portfolio and securing a steady flow of primary PPP investment opportunities as well as developing a pipeline of potential new core Infrastructure projects.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The India fund has remain challenging despite the election this year, but we did manage to sell some of our holding in power in thermal markets around the time of the election there.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Importantly, the Infrastructure team agreed an extension to the investment advisory agreement with 3iN at the beginning of the financial year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our strong balance sheet has facilitated further investments this year, which will provide good capital growth as well as income going forward.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've made 2 new PE investment in the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","this year as well as a further investment in Germany.",1395
18511,"2014m11","These are 2 of the stronger economies we're operating in today, and I'm pleased we're increasing the group's exposure to the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and Germany at this time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","All 3 investments are decent-sized businesses where we are confident of meeting our 2x return project on in-prices between 8.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5 and 9x EBITDA.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We took an opportunity to purchase an LP position in Eurofund V, increasing 3i's ownership to 57% of a fund that is now recovering very strongly.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And on the income front, we have seated 4 new CLOs as well as establishing new warehouse facilities for the further CLO launches.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We purchased Dynatech in August this year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Dynatech is a U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","-based manufacturer of protective equipment, with operations in the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and Germany.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The industrial sector has been 3i's most consistent performer over many years, and the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and Germany have been key for that performance.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've also signed an agreement to buy Q Holdings, another U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","group focused on the manufacture of precision-molded rubber and silicone components.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It has 6 manufacturing plants across the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and China as well as sales offices in Germany and Mexico.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A key part of our plan is to help the business grow organically and by acquisition in Europe.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've also announced the purchase of Krist, a leading retailer of watches and jewelry Germany.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have an existing presence in this segment through our Amor, our existing jewelry business, and we've been tracking Krist for some time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So far, realization progress has been good with over GBP 540 million of cash from sales and refinancings, and we have a good number of sales and refinancings in progress at the moment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So today, we're announcing an interim dividend of 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","7p and an additional dividend of 3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","3p, making 6p in total as well as committing to at least a 15p total dividend for the year, given the projects and refinancings that we have in hand.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I'm pleased with this outcome, and Julia will give more detail in a few minutes.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now when we first put the new plan together in June 2012, we expected FY '15 to be a relatively weak year for realizations but subject to markets, and that's a big but.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It now like it could turn out to be very much better than we originally planned.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We're continuing to see a very positive shift in capital efficiency and allocation as our operating costs come down further and we reduce our interest build.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So this is the fifth results presentation since we announced our restructuring and new strategy, and we've made material strides over that time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","After that deep restructuring in FY '13 and the resulting reduction in costs, we are now looking like a proper business, and all 3 of our divisions are performing well in terms of income this year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The asset management initiatives are having a profound impact on the performance of our portfolio of PE investments.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We continue to see significant value growth and momentum, even after allowing for the rise in sterling over the last 12 months or so.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And the investments we have made in recent years are performing particularly well and demonstrating the power of the 3i model in the international mid-market.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We aim to buy at sensible prices and grow our businesses to generate consistent alpha for shareholders and investors.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our strategic priorities for this year very much remain more of the same, thoughtful and well-executed asset management, careful new investment and tight cost control.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's a tough environment out there, and there is no question the macro environment across much of Europe is becoming more difficult.",1395
18511,"2014m11","But I now have confidence that 3i is in a far stronger position to meet any of those challenges.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So let me close by saying another thank you to the team of 3i for all their good work in the first half and Pass over to Julia.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I mean, we all know with various complexions Continental Europe struggling, so are you saying that the opportunities are being pushed away don't fully reflect what is it going on in underlying economies? Justin on price.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I guess in both yours and Julia's presentation, the thread was talking about new investments of caution.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I'm just wondering what informs that view? Thank you, Simon.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I am delighted to be reporting another set of strong results.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Today's numbers demonstrate that we're continuing to do what we said we would do in the way we build value for our investors.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We delivered excellent momentum in our Private Equity portfolio, with valuated earnings growth of 17%.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've made further progress on realizations at an average money multiple of 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We're sustaining an annual cash profit, with GBP 16 million in the first half.",1395
18511,"2014m11","During the period, we invested GBP 104 million of our Proprietary Capital and Private Equity and GBP 95 million to support further fundraising in Debt Management.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And we've confirmed that we expect to pay a total dividend this year of at least 15p, the 6p of that being declared today as an interim.",1395
18511,"2014m11","NAV at the 30th of September 2014 is 358p per share.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The strong earnings momentum in Private Equity, together with realized and operating profits, increased NAV per share by 36p.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The volatility in the currencies and strength in sterling continues to be a drag on the accounting return, reducing NAV by 8p.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And we also paid the final dividend for financial year 2014 in July of 13.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So the corresponding movements for the second quarter are shown on this slide, which shows a very similar story.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Simon spent some time talking about investment, so I'm going to focus on other aspects of the Value Build, starting with the performance of the Private Equity portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Here's our current view on the top 20 Private Equity investments, which now account for 77% of the total Proprietary Capital invested in Private Equity.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As you can see in the significant majority of cases, current performance is positive.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There's some strong progression in our larger assets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now obviously, we can't be entirely immune to the economic conditions in some of the markets where we operate, so, in particular, we stay cautious on investments in France and Spain.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The earnings growth is particularly strong at 17% on a valuated basis.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A key driver in that statistic is the performance of our largest asset, Action, which continues to show solid progression in its store rollout program and strong like-for-likes.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Excluding Action, the value-weighted earnings growth is still very good at 11%, so we're seeing good performance across the portfolio as a whole.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And that all the performance is reflected in unrealized value growth of GBP 308 million in the first half for our Private Equity investments.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Here's the breakdown of Private Equity value growth.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As well as earnings growth, the performance category reflects movements in net debt.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The value-weighted net debt for companies valued on an earnings basis was stable at 3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Within that, we have taken the opportunity to refinance investments such as Element, Animal, plus Action has completed a sale and leaseback of its new distribution center.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Equity markets in our principal countries for investments were down in the second quarter and over the half as well, so it may seem surprising that we have GBP 13 million of value growth from multiple movements.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The weighted average multiple moved up from 9.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've held Action at 12.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5x on a post-discount level, but since its value has increased, so has its weight on the average.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Excluding Action, the weighted average multiple is broadly flat at 9.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And within that, we've also taken a small number of multiples out to reflect derisking, such as refinancing or progress with an acquisition, for example.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I've talked previously about how we moderate our choice of multiples to value the portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You'll recall we look at company-specific factors and our longer-term view of expectations, and we felt for some time that market multiples were trading ahead of long-term average than transaction multiples.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This means that the multiples that we've used are generally lower by some margin than the straightforward comparable set would imply, and that margin acts a cushion in volatile markets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our monthly portfolio dashboard monitoring continue to play a fundamental role in our asset management strategy.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It allows us to identify when a portfolio company is not on track, so we can tackle potential issues quickly.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Of course, that doesn't mean that all our companies will always be on track, and to recognize that, as a matter of policy, we do use forecast earnings to value a company if they are lower than the last 12 months management's accounts.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Reflecting our more cautious outlook in Continental Europe, the number of companies that we've used forecast earnings for has gone up from 4 in March to 7.",1395
18511,"2014m11","By value, 69% of the Private Equity portfolio is valued on an earnings basis, and these 7 companies account for 12% of that value.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The imminent sell component includes highlights and LHI.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Both of these sales completed in October and, therefore, been converted into cash of GBP 189 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Finally, the DCF category relates mainly to our investments in Scandlines, which is also continuing to perform well since we made a further investment last year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The very good realizations we've achieved in the period have validated the strong performance of our portfolio of companies.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our exit from the DG, a French healthcare business, is a good example.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The uplift to opening book of 48% reflects the uncertainty that exists at the year-end about achieving this result, which was subject to French government clearance, so we're very pleased with this outcome.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We also took the opportunities to sell a number of investments, which would not be part of our investments strategy today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A patient approach means we have still generated good money multiples in a wide range of situations, 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5x following the IPO and partial exit of Fibro, a U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","animal healthcare business in which we held a minority stake; 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","8x on the sale of Fostering Partners where we've had a minority stake since 2007 and in which we've kept a loan investment; and 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","9x on the sale of the minority stake in John Hardy, a Hong Kong Chinese jewelry design and distribution business and another 2007 asset.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As I mentioned earlier, we also took advantage of positive financing markets to refinance some of our best investments, creating opportunity for cash distribution.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You can see some of them here in Action, Element and Amore.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And since the end of the period, the completion of the highlight and LHI exits have delivered returns of 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","9x, respectively.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And we've sold 20% of our investments in Quintiles above its quoted price of the 30th of September and adding another GBP 29 million of proceeds.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A feature of this half is the lower uplift to sale than we've seen in recent periods.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As you can see from the money multiples on this slide, the 12% does not mean we're doing less successful exits.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There are 2 factors having an influence.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The Phibro, Fostering Partners and John Hardy exits were very well progressed at the 31st of March and closed early in this period, so there's no further uplift to recognize.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And when we refinance an investment, it often results in the repayment of a portion of our original shareholder loans.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This will not result in a meaningful uplift.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It does concentrate value in the remaining equity.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now as I talked about in May, a consequence of this good realized and unrealized value growth is the need to recognize the potential for carry that's payable to our investing teams.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We're through the performance hurdles from an accounting perspective, so we accrue carry payable between 10% and 15% on our gross investment returns.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This has continued in this first half as we accrued a further GBP 45 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Again, cash paid is much lower at GBP 7 million in the period.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Importantly, strong performance from Fresco, Quintiles and a number of other assets in the growth capital fund means that we're recognizing carry receivable on that fund for the first time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've also seen strong performance from assets owned by 3i Infrastructure plc and are recognizing a performance fee there, too.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You can see the details on this slide.",1395
18511,"2014m11","One of our key targets in restructuring the business was achieving the operating profit on a cash basis.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We achieved that key milestone in March, recording our first operating cash profit of GBP 5 million for the year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now this is not an easy target, so I'm delighted that we've made another profit in the first half of GBP 16 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I say it's easy because it continue to focus on keeping costs under control, whilst investing to develop fee income as well as finding sensible ways to generate cash income from a portfolio that principally delivers capital returns.",1395
18511,"2014m11","On costs, having taken the significant steps to reduce the March 2002 run rate of GBP 185 million by GBP 70 million, actual costs are now only 1% of assets under management.",1395
18511,"2014m11","With restructuring behind us, we're investing in people.",1395
18511,"2014m11","For example, we have recently recruited a number of investors in our Private Equity and Infrastructure teams and fund investment relations in Debt Management, and we have launched our graduate program in the last 6 months.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now I've talked a lot about Private Equity so far.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This slide shows that Infrastructure and Debt Management are also important constituents of our strategic model.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The Debt Management team have had a very successful period of fundraising in the first half, and that will underpin their excellent contribution to the operating profit from fee income.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And the equity that we invest in the CLOs raised also generates a good cash yield.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our investments in 3i Infrastructure plc generates good cash dividend income, and we provide advisory services to that business.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The agreement for those services was renegotiated and agreed in July, and that agreement secures further advisory and performance fees for at least another 5 years.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The combination of Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management is important from a cash operating perspective.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's also important with respect to our Fund Management platform.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have made further improvement in the operating margin and absolute profitability of our Fund Management activities, as you can see here.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Simon has talked in detail about the new Private Equity investments we made in 2013.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We remain cautious and select investors in these markets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In Private Equity, we may one new investment in the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","business, now named Dynatech, and we also took an opportunity to acquire a small LP stake in Eurofund V, which increases our exposure to assets that we know very well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","After the period end, we completed a further Eurofund V investment, a gem and jewelry business called Krist and another new U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","deal, Q Holdings.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Together, these investments put another GBP 196 million of shareholder capital to work.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Finally, the success of the Debt Management business in raising new CLOs in the Europe and the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","has led to further equity investment of EUR 27 million and $10 million, respectively, as well as continued support for warehouses to build portfolios ahead of future CLO raises.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now in the light of the current market conditions, we remain happy being more active sellers than buyers and continuing to generate net divestment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As a result, the balance sheet continues to strengthen.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Gross debt fell as we bought back our B shares in June, and we had some benefit from euro translation of the 2017 bond.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As I said previously, it doesn't really make economic sense to reduce our gross debt further at this stage.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our credit is attractive, and investors have no obvious alternative, so any restructure would be fully priced.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have taken advantage of financing conditions for our own revolving credit facilities.",1395
18511,"2014m11","At the beginning of September, we replaced our existing facilities of GBP 500 million, which were due to mature in 2016, with the new facility of GBP 350 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That new facility will mature at 2019 at the earliest.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And in terms under lower amount mean that we'll save about GBP 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5 million in our annual interest build.",1395
18511,"2014m11","With gearing up 5%, there's clearly no constraint in our ability to pay additional shareholder distributions under the policy that we've been operating since May 2012.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As a reminder, provided gross debt is less than GBP 1 billion and gearing is less than 20%, we will distribute 15% to 20% of gross realization proceeds.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That gives shareholders a direct participation in our success.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The total distribution will always be at least 8.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We call out our base dividend.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've said that levels of investments will determine whether we pay at the 15% end of the range or the 20% end of the range.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This time last year, we had an unusually clear view of the likely alternative realizations for the full year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That view was supported by the very strong first half sales and our decision to bring forward GBP 220 million of proceeds from the previous year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This allowed us to confirm a total dividend of 20p at the half year results.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This time, we've had another strong start to the financial year, with over GBP 500 million of proceeds received or on their way, so we're well on track to at least meet previous guidance.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The realizations for this would be about the same level as last year or about GBP 700 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In setting the interim dividend today, we've taken the following approach.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Firstly, investment levels are improving, but they remain below our longer-term car rate.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Market conditions mean we remain cautious about investment outlook, therefore, we expect to be paying 20% of proceeds this year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So with GBP 542 million proceeds received so far, we will pay 20% of that, which is a part of GBP 108 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Secondly, the cost of the base dividend is about GBP 77 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That means that the 8.",1395
18511,"2014m11","1p is already fully covered by the GBP 108 million, and we paid the base dividend 1/3, 2/3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Thirdly, this leaves GBP 31 million in the pot, funding an additional dividend to date of 3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So 6p declared today is made up of 1/3 of 8.",1395
18511,"2014m11","1p, which is 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","7p, topped up by the 3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","3p additional.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Looking forward to the final.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We'll pay the remaining 2/3 of the base, being 5.",1395
18511,"2014m11","4p [ph] and 20% of further realizations.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And considering the visibility we have on the realizations pipeline and subject to market conditions outside our control, we expect the total dividend for FY 2015 to be at least 15p per share, including the 6p declared today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So to sum up.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We are building value for our investors in the way that we said we would.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have excellent earnings momentum in the Private Equity portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We continue to exit well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our disciplined focus on costs means we have a positive operating cash profit again.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have made some careful new investments, and we expect our full year dividend of at least 15p, with 6p of that today declared as an interim.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Thank you very much, and we'll now go over to Q&A.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I wonder if you could say a little bit about the Fund Management business, in particular, the economics of that and the operating leverage in that? Do you feel that you've got the Infrastructure you need in place here, and therefore, new CLO launches would just add top line and profitably? Or do you still think you need to do some investing in that business? I think in the Debt Management business, we are -- we're moving through what I would call the low point, if you like, CLO -- old CLOs are coming off as we write new CLOs.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I think we're moving into that positive territory, so you will see decent growth going forward if we remain at the same rate of issuance.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And we'll also see good growth coming from non-CLO funds.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I referred to 2 in the results today, the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Senior Loan Fund and then a middle market fund in Europe where they've just on their first close.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we're investing in our business to grow that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And providing begin stay at the same rate of issuance that we've seen, we do expect those numbers to move forward quite well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Chris, up at the front, yes.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In terms of Krist, it's actually deemed a further investment in Eurofund V, so we did that together with the LPs in Eurofund V.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The other 2 investments, the North American investments, were 3i investments.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it still sensible to assume high single digits low-double digits earnings growth? Yes, we probably bailed out of half a dozen processes at least this year, where the pricing has got away from us fairly quickly, and we just been uncomfortable with that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I would say, average pricing in the mid-market where we're looking is above 10x in Europe, and the better stuff is going for even higher than that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And I'm just not convinced that 2x, 2x on that sort of level isn't going to be that easy with the outlook that we have.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we are running out in those processes quite quickly.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Over at the back.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Do you want to do both? Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Two questions from me.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There was a hit to the NAV from negative FX in the first half.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I wonder how much of that might have reversed in sort of October, November? If you could give us any color on that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And second question, the -- x Action, the average multiple barely changed 9.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I wonder if you could provide any more color on the size of discounts that you use in the calculate that and how much that might have varied in the period? You have discretion over which companies to benchmark in your averages.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Are there some sort of sectors very actually sort of capped on multiple that you use by the upside that, that gives you a cushion on the way downside and whether any sector where the actually deep down hidden by the average of being flat? It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Couple of questions.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The first one is, with regards to the earnings growth of the company, obviously been quite a lot of caution today in your remarks.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I'm just trying to think, x Action, it was 11% earnings growth.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Obviously, 75% of the portfolio is U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and Europe.",1395
18511,"2014m11","What your sort of expedition the next 12 months in terms of earnings growth sort of companies? And then the way you kind of split the buckets, 1 to 4, could you give us a sense of the vintage is in each of those buckets now? On what we're seeing at the moment, I would certainly think so.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I think the caution around the environment is more about realizations in refinancings.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There is confidence is required for those things.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have a lot of stuff in trying.",1395
18511,"2014m11","If things don't change, that will be great, but if we have another October rolling out for 3 or 4 months, then it would obviously impact all sorts of markets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Any others? Okay, thanks for coming along today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Much appreciated.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Do you want to do both? It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Just a couple of questions.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The first one is with regards to the earnings growth of the company, obviously, there's been quite a lot of caution today in your remarks.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I'm just trying to think, x Action, it was 11% earnings growth.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Obviously, 75% of the portfolio is U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and Europe.",1395
18511,"2014m11","How should -- what's your sort of expectation for the next 12 months in terms of earnings growth for this sort of companies? And then the way you kind of split the buckets, 1 to 4, could you give us a sense of the vintages in each of those buckets now? In terms of Christ, it's actually deemed a further investment in Eurofund V.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we did that together with the LPs in Eurofund V.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The other 2 investments, the North American investments, were 3i investments.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Well, I think we've put some general caution out there about the economies across Europe, in particular.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And maybe if I can touch on that and then talk about the investments specifically, we're seeing quite a mixed bag of performance.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we find that our portfolios in Germany and Benelux are doing well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Germany, we think the economy, in the shape of the companies we have, has proved quite resilient.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In Benelux, we're very exposed to the discount sector.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So whether it's Basic-Fit or whether it's Action, it's the right part of that market to be in because it's quite a tough market at the time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Scandinavia is a mixed bag.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We think Sweden is pretty strong at the moment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's quite like the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11",", we would suggest, whereas Finland is really struggling.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So Finland, we think, is really weak and has deteriorated as has France.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There's been a marked deterioration, in our view, in France this year, particularly from late spring, early summer, and we don't see any change in that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So that's why we were particularly pleased to come out of Vedici in the way that we did.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Spain, we still think, is a difficult economy.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's better than it was, but nothing's easy in Spain.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Two strong economies would be North America, in particular, and the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","-- and the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And in terms of looking at where we're putting money to the work, what we're seeing at the moment is more attractive pricing generally in North America than in Europe because there is a better balance of supply of targets in the States than there is here at the moment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we can hunt in the middle of America for these nice industrial companies that we're quite good at and find those processes are very much less competitive than anything good that happens to come up in Continental Europe.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Christ played to us because people could see we had a degree of synergy with our existing jewelry investment in Germany and, therefore, were put off competing with us for that asset.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So that was a very sensible purchase, at this time, of a very good business.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it's harder to find stuff of value in Europe at the moment, I would say, and it's more attractive in the States.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it's still sensible to assume high single-digit, low double-digit earnings growth? I think it was reflective of the asset value at March and under the asset value at September.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Any more questions? Yes, one at the front here.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Two questions from me.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There was an AP hit to the NAV from negative FX in the first half.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I wonder if you track how much of that might have reversed in sort of October, November, if you could give us any color on that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And the second question, the -- x Action, the average multiple barely changed, 9.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I wonder if you could provide any more color on the size of discounts that you're using to calculate that and how much that might have varied in the period.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You have discretion over which companies to benchmark in your averages.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Are there some sort of sectors where you're actually sort of capped on multiple that you use on the upside that then gives you cushion on the way downside? And were there any sectors, actually, where the multiples did go down? It's just dwarfed by the -- no, hidden by the average of being flat.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to 3i's Interim Results.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've had another good first half, with solid results across the group.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Despite the tricky macro and volatile stock markets, we're building real value growth across our investment portfolios.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've seen a good level of realization activity, and we've made some important new investments in North America and Germany.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And we have made good progress with group KPIs, with further reductions in operating and interest costs.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've also delivered a growing base of cash realizations to underpin this year's dividend.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We secured GBP 324 million of realizations in the first half and another GBP 218 million of cash since then, including the successful placing of some of our stock in Quintiles last week.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The portfolio has performed well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In fact, we've seen GBP 360 million of value growth and income based on strong earnings momentum in our larger investments, such as Action and Element.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Operating costs are now running at 1% of AUM compared to 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","6% in 2012.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That's very much in line with or better than industry benchmarks, and this has helped in increasing our first half Fund Management profit of GBP 13 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now as you know, I took over as CEO in May 2012, and we announced the new strategy for the group in June 2012.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Well, we've come a long a way since then, and I'm pleased to say there is very strong momentum in the group today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Even with adverse foreign currency markets, we've produced a good recovery in total returns underpinned by strong asset management and realization performance, a substantial reduction in costs and much improved cash flow.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That's the stuff that pays dividends to shareholders and cash back to LPs.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You should now all be familiar with our strategy.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's simple and it includes all 3 of our businesses.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The combination of our complementary asset management capabilities across 3 platforms, together with our permanent capital, gives our shareholders a clearly differentiated and attractive value proposition.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now I'd like to use the 3i Value Build, which we first presented in 2012, as the structure for today's presentation.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I'll comment on each of the steps, starting with portfolio earnings.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Here are the 4 3i buckets, which I used to analyze the Private Equity portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I've set down some examples for each bucket and the percentage of value using the 30th September values that each bucket accounts for.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Back in May 2012, 3i had 130 investments, with too many in buckets 3 and 4.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we've been on a journey with the aim of reducing that number of investments down to 40 or less, with those 40 comprising the 2 stronger buckets, 1 and 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've had another good run of realizations, and the majority of which have come from our non-core buckets 3 and 4.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So the overall portfolio is increasingly dominated by our keepers or higher-value potential assets in bucket 1 or our strong performance in bucket 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In fact, the value weighted average LTM earnings growth of 17% across the portfolio is driven by the strong growth we are seeing across our larger investments in buckets 1 and 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","While our companies in the top 2 buckets are more able to cope with the challenging macro climate, it is not always the case for those companies in buckets 3 and 4, but the strong market for realizations, which is underpinned by QE and lots of dry powder of potential buyers, has meant we have been able to trade out a number of our weaker or non-core companies at attractive valuations.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our mid-market PE portfolio has good earnings momentum, which compares very favorably with stock market comparables or, indeed, other PE portfolios and will underpin significant cash distributions from the group over the coming years.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've overhauled our approach to asset management in 2012 and introducing 6 new initiatives and much greater productivity across the portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","These changes, which encompassed our monthly dashboard monitoring and more rigorous exit planning, are an important factor in the resilient performance of the portfolio we're seeing today, and I thought this would be a useful time to look at the investments we made last year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We made 4 investments, 3 new and 1 large follow-on in Scandlines, and despite the competition for good assets, we bought them well at attractive entry multiples, an average across the floor of 8x EBITDA.",1395
18511,"2014m11","All are performing in line or ahead of plan, with average earnings growth of 23% over the last 12 months.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And I'd now like to give you a look at each of those investments.",1395
18511,"2014m11","GIF is a German testing and engineering business focused on transmission systems in the automotive sector.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We know the testing on automotive sectors extremely well, and GIF is a classic German Mittelstand business.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our long-term plan is to reposition the business as much more of a pure-play testing business with the value-added engineering capability and to continue its drive for international expansion.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The plan is going well, with the business expecting to generate EBITDA growth of 25% for the current financial year and a good buildup of sales in the China operation, in particular.",1395
18511,"2014m11","JMJ is a global leader in safety consultancy and works for major oil, industrial and aerospace companies around the world.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The business is based out of Austin, Texas, but it has a U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It is a sector leader and is capable of significant international expansion as well as growing [ph] through entering new sectors.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It enjoys strong levels of organic growth and has a very blue-chip roster of major clients, such as Chevron, Shell and Lend Lease.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The business was introduced to us by the Chairman of Element, which gave us the chance to buy the company away from an auction process.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now I talked about Basic-Fit and its founder, Rene Moos, last year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's our discount gym format in the Benelux.",1395
18511,"2014m11","If you like, it's our Action of the gym world.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Again, we purchased Basic-Fit away from a competitive process and have enjoyed some spectacular growth in the company's first year under our ownership, with 42 new clubs and a likely increase of over 50% in EBITDA this year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We are now the market leader in both Holland and Belgium and have just started to open gyms in France and Spain.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So our new investments are performing well, and we have sensible end prices against which to target our money multiple returns.",1395
18511,"2014m11","GIF and JMJ are classic bucket 2 investments, and it's already pretty clear the Basic-Fit is more likely to be a bucket 1 candidate.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've delivered another good round of realizations and refinancing in the first half, and Julia will be giving you more detail on this in her section.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've continued to focus on disposals of non-core assets, with just one sale from bucket 2 in the first half and another 2, Hilite and LHi, closing last month.",1395
18511,"2014m11","At the 30th of September, we had reduced the number of investments to 72.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now I'd also like to talk about 2 of those bucket 2 disposals, Vedici and Hilite.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Vedici, a French hospital group, was sold in September to CVC, netting 3i GBP 83 million of proceeds and a 2x money multiple in 4 years.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now France is a very difficult market at present, and our Paris team did a great job in securing this exit on these terms.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We made a 48% profit over our March 14 book value on this sale.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Hilite, a German automotive group which we bought in 2011, was another classic bucket 2 asset.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We refocused the group, investing in R&D and expanding geographic sales through China, in particular.",1395
18511,"2014m11","1x our money through a very competitive auction process, eventually selling to a Chinese company, AVIC Electromechanical Systems, at the end of October.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now moving to the group.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our operating cash profit continued its improving trajectory in the first half at GBP 16 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That reflects a further reduction in the cost base and improving income performance across our 3 businesses.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Debt Management has made a good contribution to that income.",1395
18511,"2014m11","To date, they have issued 4 CLOs, 2 in the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and 2 in Europe, as well as grown their U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Senior Loan Fund and achieving a first close on a European Middle Market Loan Fund at EUR 250 million this week.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The Infrastructure team has also had a productive first half, seeing strong growth in its core European portfolio and securing a steady flow of primary PPP investment opportunities as well as developing a pipeline of potential new core infrastructure projects.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The India Fund has remained challenging despite the election this year, but we did manage to sell some of our holding in Adani Power in thermal markets around the time of the election there.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Importantly, the Infrastructure team agreed an extension to the investment advisory agreement with 3iN at the beginning of the financial year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our strong balance sheet has facilitated further investments this year, which will provide good capital growth as well as income going forward.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've made 2 new PE investments in the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","this year as well as a further investment in Germany.",1395
18511,"2014m11","These are 2 of the stronger economies we're operating in today, and I am pleased we're increasing the group's exposure to the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and Germany at this time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","All 3 investments are decent-sized businesses, where we are confident of meeting our 2x return target on end prices of between 8.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5 and 9x EBITDA.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We took an opportunity to purchase an LP position in Eurofund V, increasing 3i's ownership to 57% of a fund that is now recovering very strongly, and on the income front, we have seeded 4 new CLOs as well as establishing new warehouse facilities for the further CLO launches.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We purchased Dynatect in August this year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Dynatect is a U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","-based manufacturer of protective equipment, with operations in the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and Germany.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The industrial sector has been 3i's most consistent performer over many years, and the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and Germany have been key to that performance.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've also signed an agreement to buy Q Holdings, another U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","group focused on the manufacture of precision-molded rubber and silicone components.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It has 6 manufacturing plants across the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and China as well as sales offices in Germany and Mexico.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A key part of our plan is to help the business grow organically and by acquisition in Europe.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've also announced the purchase of Christ, a leading retailer of watches and jewelry Germany.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have an existing presence in this segment through Amor, our existing jewelry business, and we've been tracking Christ for some time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So far, realization progress has been good, with over GBP 540 million of cash from sales and refinancings, and we have a good number of sales and refinancings in progress at the moment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So today, we're announcing an interim dividend of 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","7p and an additional dividend of 3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","3p, making 6p in total, as well as committing to at least a 15p total dividend for the year given the projects and refinancings that we have in hand.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I'm pleased with this outcome, and Julia will give you more detail in a few minutes.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now when we first put the new plan together in June 2012, we expected FY '15 to be a relatively weak year for realizations, but subject to markets -- and that's a big but, it now looks like it could turn out to be very much better than we originally planned.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We're continuing to see a very positive shift in capital efficiency and allocation as our operating costs come down further and we reduce our interest bill.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So this is the fifth results presentation since we announced our restructuring and new strategy, and we have made material strides over that time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","After the deep restructuring in FY '13 and the resulting reduction in costs, we are now looking like a proper business, and all 3 of our divisions are performing well in terms of income this year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The asset management initiatives are having a profound impact on the performance of our portfolio of PE investments.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We continue to see significant value growth and momentum even after allowing for the rise in sterling over the last 12 months or so, and the investments we have made in recent years are performing particularly well and demonstrating the power of the 3i model in the international mid-market.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We aim to buy at sensible prices and grow our businesses to generate consistent alpha for shareholders and investors.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our strategic priorities for this year very much remain more of the same: thoughtful and well-executed asset management, careful new investment and tight cost control.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's a tough environment out there, and there is no question the macro environment across much of Europe is becoming more difficult, but I now have confidence that 3i is in a far stronger position to meet any of those challenges.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So let me close by saying another thank you to the team of 3i for all their good work in the first half and pass over to Julia.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Thanks, Julia.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have some mics for Q&A, so if you -- this is being recorded, so if you could wait for a mic and then say your name and give us your question.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Daniel? Okay.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Let me try and answer those 2 questions.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I think in -- my words of caution are really focused on the macro in certain countries and the volatility in the financial markets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","They're not focused on the performance of our companies in buckets 1 and 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have very good momentum in most of those companies, and as I said in my words, they're the sort of companies who can cope.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have a difficult environment, and that's what we're seeing.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So there's no stop warning about that aspect of our portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","To the second point, the bigger and the newer companies tend to be heavily represented in buckets 1 and 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So that's where the value is.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That's where the stronger momentum is.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A lot of the '07, '08 type companies are in buckets 3 and 4, if I were to generalize in that way.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Nothing we've bought recently is in bucket 4.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I can assure you that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I mean, we all know that with various complexions, Continental Europe is struggling.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So are you saying that the opportunities that are being pushed away don't fully reflect what is going on in underlying economies? And just another question, could you perhaps disclose what sort of price relative to asset value was paid for the stake in Eurofund V? It's Justin Thomson from T.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Rowe Price.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I guess, in both yours and Julia's presentation, the thread was talking about new investments of caution.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I'm just wondering what informs that view.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I think in the Debt Management business, we're moving through, what I would call, the low point in that, if you like, CLO -- old CLOs are coming off as we write new CLOs.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I think we're moving into net positive territory.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So you will see decent growth going forward if we remain at the same rate of issuance, and we'll also see good growth coming from non-CLO funds.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I referred to 2 in the results today, the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Senior Loan Fund and the new Middle Market Fund in Europe, where they adjust [ph] on the first close.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we're investing in our business to grow that, and providing we can stay at the same rate of issuance that we've seen, we do expect those numbers to move forward quite well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Chris? Up at the front here.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Thank you, Simon.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I am delighted to be reporting another set of strong results.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Today's numbers demonstrate that we're continuing to do what we said we would do in the way we build value for our investors.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We delivered excellent momentum in our Private Equity portfolio, with valuated earnings growth at 17%.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've made further progress on realizations at an average money multiple of 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We're sustaining an annual cash profit, with GBP 16 million in the first half.",1395
18511,"2014m11","During the period, we invested GBP 104 million of our Proprietary Capital and Private Equity and GBP 95 million to support further fund-raising in Debt Management, and we've confirmed that we expect to pay a total dividend this year of at least 15p, the 6p of that being declared today as an interim.",1395
18511,"2014m11","NAV at the 30th of September 2014, is 358p per share.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The strong earnings momentum in Private Equity, together with realized and operating profits, increased NAV per share by 36p.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The volatility in currencies and strength in sterling continued to be a drag on the accounting return, reducing NAV by 8p, and we also paid the final dividend for financial year 2014 in July of 13.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So the corresponding movements for the second quarter are shown on this slide, which shows a very similar story.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Simon spent some time talking about investment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I'm going to focus on other aspects of the Value Build, starting with the performance of the Private Equity portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Here's our current view on the top 20 Private Equity investments, which now account for 77% of the total Proprietary Capital invested in Private Equity.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As you can see, in the significant majority of cases, current performance is positive.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There's some strong progression in our larger assets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now obviously, we can't be entirely immune to the economic conditions in some of the markets where we operate.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So, in particular, we stay cautious on investments in France and Spain.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The earnings growth is particularly strong at 17% on a valuated basis.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A key driver in that statistic is the performance of our largest asset, Action, which continues to show solid progression in its store rollout program and strong like-for-likes.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Excluding Action, the value-weighted earnings growth is still very good at 11%.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we're seeing good performance across the portfolio as a whole, and that solid performance is reflected in unrealized value growth of GBP 308 million in the first half for our Private Equity investments.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Here's the breakdown of Private Equity value growth.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As well as earnings growth, the performance category reflects movements in net debt.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The value-weighted net debt for companies valued on an earnings basis was stable at 3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Within that, we have taken the opportunity to refinance investments, such as Element and Amor, plus Action has completed a sale and leaseback of its new distribution center.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Equity markets in our principal countries for investment were down in the second quarter and over the half as well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it may seem surprising that we have GBP 13 million of value growth from multiple movements.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The weighted average multiple moved up from 9.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've held Action at 12.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5x on a post-discount level, but since its value has increased, so has its weight in the average.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Excluding Action, the weighted average multiple is broadly flat at 9.",1395
18511,"2014m11","1x, and within that, we've also taken a small number of multiples out to reflect derisking, such as refinancing or progress with an acquisition, for example.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I've talked previously about how we moderate our choice of multiples to value the portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You will recall we look at company-specific factors and our longer-term view of expectations, and we felt for some time that market multiples were trading ahead of long-term average transaction multiples.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This means that the multiples that we've used are generally lower by some margin than the straightforward comparable set would imply, and that margin acts as a cushion in volatile markets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our monthly portfolio dashboard monitoring continue to play a fundamental role in our asset management strategy.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It allows us to identify when a portfolio company is not on track so we can tackle potential issues quickly.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Of course, that doesn't mean that all our companies will always be on track, and to recognize that, as a matter of policy, we use forecast earnings to value a company if they are lower than the last 12 months' management accounts.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Reflecting our more cautious outlook in Continental Europe, the number of companies that we've used forecast earnings for has gone up from 4 in March to 7.",1395
18511,"2014m11","By value, 69% of the Private Equity portfolio is valued on an earnings basis, and these 7 companies account for 12% of that value.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The imminent sale component includes Hilite and LHi.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Both of these sales completed in October and have, therefore, been converted into cash of GBP 189 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Finally, the DCF category relates mainly to our investment in Scandlines, which has also continued to perform well since we made our further investment last year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The very good realizations we've achieved in the period have validated the strong performance of our portfolio of companies.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our exit from Vedici, a French health care business, is a good example.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The uplift to opening book of 48% reflects the uncertainty that existed at the year-end about achieving this result, which was subject to French government clearance.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we're very pleased with this outcome.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We also took the opportunity to sell a number of investments, which would not be part of our investment strategy today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A patient approach means we have still generated good money multiples in a wide range of situations, 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5x following the IPO and partial exit of Phibro, a U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","animal health care business in which we held a minority stake; 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","8x on the sale of Foster + Partners, where we've had a minority stake since 2007 and in which we've kept a loan investment; and 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","9x on the sale of the minority stake in John Hardy, a Hong Kong Chinese jewelry design and distribution business and another 2007 asset.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As I mentioned earlier, we also took advantage of positive financing markets to refinance some of our best investments, creating the opportunity for cash distribution.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You can see some of them here in Action, Element and Amor.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And since the end of the period, the completion of the Hilite and LHi exits have delivered returns of 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","9x, respectively, and we've sold 20% of our investments in Quintiles above its quoted price at the 30th of September and adding another GBP 29 million of proceeds.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A feature of this half is the lower uplift to sale than we've seen in recent periods.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As you can see from the money multiples on this slide, the 12% does not mean we're doing less successful exits.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There are 2 factors having an influence.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The Phibro, Foster + Partners and John Hardy exits were very well progressed at the 31st of March and closed early in this period.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So there's no further uplift to recognize.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And when we refinance an investment, it often results in the repayment of a portion of our original shareholder loans.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This will not result in a meaningful uplift.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It does concentrate value in the remaining equity.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now as I talked about in May, a consequence of this good realized and unrealized value growth is the need to recognize the potential for carry that's payable to our investing teams.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We're through the performance hurdles from an accounting perspective.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we accrue carry payable between 10% and 15% on our gross investment returns.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This has continued in this first half as we accrued a further GBP 45 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Again, cash paid is much lower at GBP 7 million in the period.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Importantly, strong performance from Refresco, Quintiles and a number of other assets in the growth capital fund means that we're recognizing carry receivable on that fund for the first time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've also seen strong performance from assets owned by 3i Infrastructure plc and are recognizing a performance fee there, too.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You can see the details on this slide.",1395
18511,"2014m11","One of our key targets in restructuring the business was achieving the operating profit on a cash basis.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We achieved that key milestone in March, recording our first operating cash profit of GBP 5 million for the year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now this is not an easy target.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I'm delighted that we have made another profit in the first half of GBP 16 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I say it isn't easy because it needs continued focus on keeping costs under control whilst investing to develop fee income as well as finding sensible ways to generate cash income from a portfolio that principally delivers capital returns.",1395
18511,"2014m11","On costs, having taken the significant steps to reduce the March 2002 run rate of GBP 185 million by GBP 70 million, actual costs are now only 1% of assets under management.",1395
18511,"2014m11","With restructuring behind us, we're investing in people.",1395
18511,"2014m11","For example, we have recently recruited a number of investors in our Private Equity and Infrastructure teams and in fund investor relations in Debt Management, and we have launched our graduate program in the last 6 months.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now I've talked a lot about Private Equity so far.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This slide shows that Infrastructure and Debt Management are also important constituents of our strategic model.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The Debt Management team have had a very successful period of fund-raising in the first half, and that will underpin their excellent contribution to the operating profit from fee income, and the equity that we invest in the CLOs raised also generates a good cash yield.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our investment in 3i Infrastructure plc generates good cash dividend income, and we provide advisory services to that business.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The agreement for those services was renegotiated and agreed in July, and that agreement secures further advisory and performance fees for at least another 5 years.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The combination of Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management is important from a cash operating perspective.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's also important with respect to our Fund Management platform.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have made further improvement in the operating margin and absolute profitability of our Fund Management activities, as you can see here.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Simon has talked in detail about the new Private Equity investments we made in 2013.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We remain cautious and selective investors in these markets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In Private Equity, we made one new investment in a U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","business, now named Dynatect, and we also took an opportunity to acquire a small LP stake in Eurofund V, which increases our exposure to assets that we know very well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","After the period end, we completed a further Eurofund V investment, a German jewelry business called Christ, and another new U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","deal, Q Holdings.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Together, these investments put another GBP 196 million of shareholder capital to work.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Finally, the success of the Debt Management business in raising new CLOs in Europe and the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","has led to further equity investment of EUR 27 million and $10 million, respectively, as well as continued support for warehouses to build portfolios ahead of future CLO raises.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now in the light of the current market conditions, we remain happy being more active sellers than buyers and continuing to generate net divestment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As a result, the balance sheet continues to strengthen.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Gross debt fell as we bought back our B shares in June, and we had some benefit from euro translation of the 2017 bond.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As I said previously, it doesn't really make economic sense to reduce our gross debt further at this stage.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our credit is attractive, and investors have no obvious alternative.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So any restructure would be fully priced.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have taken advantage of financing conditions for our own revolving credit facilities.",1395
18511,"2014m11","At the beginning of September, we replaced our existing facilities of GBP 500 million, which were due to mature in 2016, with a new facility of GBP 350 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That new facility will mature at 2019 at the earliest, and improved terms and the lower amount mean that we'll save about GBP 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5 million on our annual interest bill.",1395
18511,"2014m11","With gearing at 5%, there's clearly no constraint on our ability to pay additional shareholder distributions under the policy that we've been operating since May 2012.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As a reminder, provided gross debt is less than GBP 1 billion and gearing is less than 20%, we will distribute 15% to 20% of gross realization proceeds.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That gives shareholders a direct participation in our success.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The total distribution will always be at least 8.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We call that our base dividend.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've said that levels of investments will determine whether we pay at the 15% end of the range or the 20% end of the range.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This time last year, we had an unusually clear view of the likely outturn of realizations for the full year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That view was supported by the very strong first half sales and our decision to bring forward GBP 220 million of proceeds from the previous year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This allowed us to confirm a total dividend of 20p at the half year results.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This time, we've had another strong start to the financial year with over GBP 500 million of proceeds received or on their way.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we're well on track to at least meet our previous guidance that realizations for the year would be about the same level as last year or about GBP 700 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In setting the interim dividend today, we've taken the following approach: Firstly, investment levels are improving, but they remain below our longer-term par rate.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Market conditions mean we remain cautious about investment outlook.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Therefore, we expect to be paying 20% of proceeds this year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So with GBP 542 million proceeds received so far, we will pay 20% of that, which is at pot of GBP 108 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Secondly, the cost of the base dividend is about GBP 77 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That means that the 8.",1395
18511,"2014m11","1p is already fully covered by the GBP 108 million, and we paid the base dividend 1/3, 2/3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Thirdly, this leaves GBP 31 million in the pot, funding an additional dividend to date of 3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So the 6p declared today is made up of 1/3 of 8.",1395
18511,"2014m11","1p, which is 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","7p, topped up by the 3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","3p additional.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Looking forward to the final, we'll pay the remaining 2/3 of the base, being 5.",1395
18511,"2014m11","4p, and 20% of further realizations.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And considering the visibility that we have on the realizations pipeline and subject to market conditions outside our control, we expect the total dividend for FY 2015 to be at least 15p per share, including the 6p declared today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So to sum up.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We are building value for our investors in the way that we said we would.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have excellent earnings momentum in the Private Equity portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We continue to exit well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our disciplined focus on costs means we have a positive operating cash profit again.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have made some careful new investments, and we expect our full year dividend of at least 15p, with 6p of that today declared as an interim.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Thank you very much, and we'll now go over to Q&A.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've probably bailed out of half a dozen processes at least this year, where the pricing has got away from us fairly quickly and we've just been uncomfortable with that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I would say, average pricing in the mid-market, where we're looking, is above 10x in Europe, and the better stuff is going for even higher than that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And I'm just not convinced that 2x on that sort of level isn't going to be that easy with the outlook that we have.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we are running out in those processes quite quickly.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Over at the back.",1395
18511,"2014m11","On what we're seeing at the moment, I would certainly think so.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I think the caution around the environment is more about realizations and refinancings.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This confidence is required for those things.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have a lot of stuff in train [ph].",1395
18511,"2014m11","If things don't change, that will be great, but if we have another October rolling out for 3 or 4 months, then it will obviously impact all sorts of market.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Any others? Okay, thanks for coming along today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I much appreciate it.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Philip? I wonder if you could say a little bit about the Fund Management business, in particular the economics of that and the operating leverage in that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Do you feel you've got the Infrastructure you need in place here, and therefore, new CLO launches sort of just add top line and profitability? Or do you still think you need to do some investing in that business? Chris Brown from JPMorgan Caz.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Just on the new investments, to what extent did your new coinvestors take part in those? Yes, it's one my favorite jobs.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's tracking the FX movements on a daily basis, and we have looked at it [ph] quite a bit since the end of September.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The last time I looked, it was -- about GBP 27 million had reversed.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have given you the sensitivity, again, in the pack.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I think it's on Slide 51, where you can see what a 1% movement in the currency does based on the net assets at the 30th of September.",1395
18511,"2014m11","On the multiples, as you said, excluding Action, which -- as I explained, we didn't move the multiple.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's one of our highest multiples in the valuations at 12.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5x on a post-discount basis and it's our largest Private Equity asset.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So holding that flat for the value going up pushes up the multiple average including it.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Elsewhere, we have been doing this for a while.",1395
18511,"2014m11","When we set -- when we look at the concepts that we're choosing, we're looking at a number of factors, things that you'd expect, the right sector, the absolute size of the company, its relative performance, the levels of leverage.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And they're pretty bespokely chosen now in terms of how we then adjust that comp set to the asset that we're trying to value.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's all the more important because the top 20 is 77% of the values.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it makes sense to be quite precise in the way that we do that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Because of that, I can't really give you sort of a thematic in this sector we have taken this approach.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have absolutely looked at some of our businesses, where we have a view about likely exit multiple.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And as we've seen, the market moved away at the beginning of this calendar year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've effectively kept that multiple.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It doesn't mean we hold the multiples completely flat, and as I mentioned in a couple of stronger cases of our assets, we treat multiples up slightly, where they completed refinancing or made some progress with the transformation.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've had a number of multiples that have gone, in fact, down in the period as well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it's quite a mixture, but the strong performance has kept the multiples overall flat.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's Justin Thomson from T.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Rowe Price.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I guess, in both yours and Julia's presentation, the thread was talking about new investments of caution.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I'm just wondering what informs that view.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've probably bailed out of half a dozen processes at least this year, where the pricing has got away from us fairly quickly and we've just been uncomfortable with that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I would say, average pricing in the mid-market, where we're looking, is above 10x in Europe, and the better stuff is going for even higher than that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And I'm just not convinced that 2x on that sort of level is going to be that easy with the outlook that we have.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we are running out in those processes quite quickly.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Over at the back.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I think in the Debt Management business, we're moving through, what I would call, the low point in that, if you like, CLO -- old CLOs are coming off as we write new CLOs.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I think we're moving into net positive territory.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So you will see decent growth going forward if we remain at the same rate of issuance, and we'll also see good growth coming from non-CLO funds.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I referred to 2 in the results today, the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Senior Loan Fund and the new Middle Market Fund in Europe, where they've just done a first close.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we're investing in our business to grow that, and providing we can stay at the same rate of issuance that we've seen, we do expect those numbers to move forward quite well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Chris? Up at the front here.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it's still sensible to assume high single-digit, low double-digit earnings growth? On what we're seeing at the moment, I would certainly think so.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I think the caution around the environment is more about realizations and refinancings.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This confidence is required for those things.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have a lot of stuff in train.",1395
18511,"2014m11","If things don't change, that will be great, but if we have another October rolling out for 3 or 4 months, then it will obviously impact all sorts of markets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Any others? Okay, thanks for coming along today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Much appreciated.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I mean, we all know that with various complexions, Continental Europe is struggling.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So are you saying that the opportunities that are being pushed away don't fully reflect what is going on in underlying economies? Thanks, Julia.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have some mics for Q&A, so if you -- this is being recorded, so if you could wait for a mic and then say your name and give us your question.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Daniel? And just another question, would you be able to disclose what sort of price relative to asset value was paid for the stake in Eurofund V? I wonder if you could say a little bit about the Fund Management business, in particular the economics of that and the operating leverage in that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Do you feel you've got the Infrastructure you need in place here, and therefore, new CLO launches sort of just add top line and profitability? Or do you still think you need to do some investing in that business? In terms of Christ, it's actually deemed a further investment in Eurofund V.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we did that together with the LPs in Eurofund V.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The other 2 investments, the North American investments, were 3i investments.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Do you want to do both? It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Just a couple of questions.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The first one is with regards to the earnings growth of the company, obviously, there's been quite a lot of caution today in your remarks.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I'm just trying to think, x Action, it was 11% earnings growth.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Obviously, 75% of the portfolio is U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and Europe.",1395
18511,"2014m11","How should -- what's your sort of expectation for the next 12 months in terms of earnings growth for those sort of companies? And then the way you kind of split the buckets, 1 to 4, could you give us a sense of the vintages in each of those buckets now? I think it was reflective of the asset value at March and under the asset value at September.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Any more questions? Yes, one at the front here.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Caz.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Just on the new investments, to what extent did your new coinvestors take part in those? Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to 3i's Interim Results.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've had another good first half, with solid results across the group.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Despite the tricky macro and volatile stock markets, we're building real value growth across our investment portfolios.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've seen a good level of realization activity, and we've made some important new investments in North America and Germany.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And we have made good progress with group KPIs, with further reductions in operating and interest costs.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've also delivered a growing base of cash realizations to underpin this year's dividend.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We secured GBP 324 million of realizations in the first half and another GBP 218 million of cash since then, including the successful placing of some of our stock in Quintiles last week.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The portfolio has performed well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In fact, we've seen GBP 360 million of value growth and income based on strong earnings momentum in our larger investments, such as Action and Element.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Operating costs are now running at 1% of AUM compared to 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","6% in 2012.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That's very much in line with or better than industry benchmarks, and this has helped in increasing our first half Fund Management profit of GBP 13 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now as you know, I took over as CEO in May 2012, and we announced a new strategy for the group in June 2012.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Well, we've come a long a way since then, and I'm pleased to say there is very strong momentum in the group today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Even with adverse foreign currency markets, we've produced a good recovery in total returns underpinned by strong asset management and realization performance, a substantial reduction in costs and much improved cash flow.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That's the stuff that pays dividends to shareholders and cash back to LPs.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You should now all be familiar with our strategy.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's simple and it includes all 3 of our businesses.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The combination of our complementary asset management capabilities across 3 platforms, together with our permanent capital, gives our shareholders a clearly differentiated and attractive value proposition.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now I'd like to use the 3i Value Build, which we first presented in 2012, as the structure for today's presentation.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I'll comment on each of the steps, starting with portfolio earnings.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Here are the 4 3i buckets, which I used to analyze the Private Equity portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I've set down some examples for each bucket and the percentage of value using the 30th September values that each bucket accounts for.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Back in May 2012, 3i had 130 investments, with too many in buckets 3 and 4.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we've been on a journey with the aim of reducing that number of investments down to 40 or less, with those 40 comprising the 2 stronger buckets, 1 and 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've had another good run of realizations, and the majority of which have come from our non-core buckets 3 and 4.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So the overall portfolio is increasingly dominated by our keepers or higher-value potential assets in bucket 1 or our strong performance in bucket 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In fact, the value weighted average LTM earnings growth of 17% across the portfolio is driven by the strong growth we are seeing across our larger investments in buckets 1 and 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","While our companies in the top 2 buckets are more able to cope with the challenging macro climate, it is not always the case for those companies in buckets 3 and 4, but the strong market for realizations, which is underpinned by QE and lots of dry powder or potential buyers, has meant we have been able to trade out a number of our weaker or non-core companies at attractive valuations.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our mid-market PE portfolio has good earnings momentum, which compares very favorably with stock market comparables or, indeed, other PE portfolios and will underpin significant cash distributions from the group over the coming years.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've overhauled our approach to asset management in 2012 and are introducing 6 new initiatives and much greater productivity across the portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","These changes, which encompassed our monthly dashboard monitoring and more rigorous exit planning, are an important factor in the resilient performance of the portfolio we're seeing today, and I thought this would be a useful time to look at the investments we made last year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We made 4 investments, 3 new and 1 large follow-on in Scandlines, and despite the competition for good assets, we bought them well at attractive entry multiples, an average across the 4 of 8x EBITDA.",1395
18511,"2014m11","All are performing in line or ahead of plan, with average earnings growth of 23% over the last 12 months.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And I'd now like to give you a look at each of those investments.",1395
18511,"2014m11","GIF is a German testing and engineering business focused on transmission systems in the automotive sector.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We know the testing and automotive sectors extremely well, and GIF is a classic German Mittelstand business.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our long-term plan is to reposition the business as much more of a pure-play testing business with the value-added engineering capability and to continue its drive for international expansion.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The plan is going well, with the business expecting to generate EBITDA growth of 25% for the current financial year and a good buildup of sales in the China operation, in particular.",1395
18511,"2014m11","JMJ is a global leader in safety consultancy and works for major oil, industrial and aerospace companies around the world.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The business is based out of Austin, Texas, but it has a U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It is a sector leader and is capable of significant international expansion as well as growing through entering new sectors.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It enjoys strong levels of organic growth and has a very blue-chip roster of major clients, such as Chevron, Shell and Lend Lease.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The business was introduced to us by the Chairman of Element, which gave us the chance to buy the company away from an auction process.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now I talked about Basic-Fit and its founder, Rene Moos, last year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's our discount gym format in the Benelux.",1395
18511,"2014m11","If you like, it's our Action of the gym world.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Again, we purchased Basic-Fit away from a competitive process and have enjoyed some spectacular growth in the company's first year under our ownership, with 42 new clubs and a likely increase of over 50% in EBITDA this year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We are now the market leader in both Holland and Belgium and have just started to open gyms in France and Spain.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So our new investments are performing well, and we have sensible end prices against which to target our money multiple returns.",1395
18511,"2014m11","GIF and JMJ are classic bucket 2 investments, and it's already pretty clear the Basic-Fit is more likely to be a bucket 1 candidate.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've delivered another good round of realizations and refinancings in the first half, and Julia will be giving you more detail on this in her section.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've continued to focus on disposals of non-core assets, with just one sale from bucket 2 in the first half and another 2, Hilite and LHi, closing last month.",1395
18511,"2014m11","At the 30th of September, we had reduced the number of investments to 72.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now I'd also like to talk about 2 of those bucket 2 disposals, Vedici and Hilite.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Vedici, a French hospital group, was sold in September to CVC, netting 3i GBP 83 million of proceeds and a 2x money multiple in 4 years.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now France is a very difficult market at present, and our Paris team did a great job in securing this exit on these terms.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We made a 48% profit over our March 14 book value on this sale.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Hilite, a German automotive group which we bought in 2011, was another classic bucket 2 asset.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We refocused the group, investing in R&D and expanding geographic sales through China, in particular.",1395
18511,"2014m11","1x our money through a very competitive auction process, eventually selling to a Chinese company, AVIC Electromechanical Systems, at the end of October.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now moving to the group.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our operating cash profit continued its improving trajectory in the first half at GBP 16 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That reflects a further reduction in the cost base and improving income performance across our 3 businesses.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Debt Management has made a good contribution to that income.",1395
18511,"2014m11","To date, they have issued 4 CLOs, 2 in the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and 2 in Europe, as well as growing their U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Senior Loan Fund and achieving a first close on a European Middle Market Loan Fund at EUR 250 million this week.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The Infrastructure team has also had a productive first half, seeing strong growth in its core European portfolio and securing a steady flow of primary PPP investment opportunities as well as developing a pipeline of potential new core infrastructure projects.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The India Fund has remained challenging despite the election this year, but we did manage to sell some of our holding in Adani Power in firmer markets around the time of the election there.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Importantly, the Infrastructure team agreed an extension to the investment advisory agreement with 3iN at the beginning of the financial year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our strong balance sheet has facilitated further investments this year, which will provide good capital growth as well as income going forward.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've made 2 new PE investments in the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","this year as well as a further investment in Germany.",1395
18511,"2014m11","These are 2 of the stronger economies we're operating in today, and I am pleased we're increasing the group's exposure to the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and Germany at this time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","All 3 investments are decent-sized businesses, where we are confident of meeting our 2x return target on end prices of between 8.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5 and 9x EBITDA.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We took an opportunity to purchase an LP position in Eurofund V, increasing 3i's ownership to 57% of a fund that is now recovering very strongly, and on the income front, we have seeded 4 new CLOs as well as establishing new warehouse facilities for the further CLO launches.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We purchased Dynatect in August this year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Dynatect is a U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","-based manufacturer of protective equipment, with operations in the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and Germany.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The industrial sector has been 3i's most consistent performer over many years, and the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and Germany have been key to that performance.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've also signed an agreement to buy Q Holdings, another U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","group focused on the manufacture of precision-molded rubber and silicone components.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It has 6 manufacturing plants across the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and China as well as sales offices in Germany and Mexico.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A key part of our plan is to help the business grow organically and by acquisition in Europe.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've also announced the purchase of Christ, a leading retailer of watches and jewelry in Germany.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have an existing presence in this segment through Amor, our existing jewelry business, and we've been tracking Christ for some time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So far, realization progress has been good, with over GBP 540 million of cash from sales and refinancings, and we have a good number of sales and refinancings in progress at the moment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So today, we're announcing an interim dividend of 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","7p and an additional dividend of 3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","3p, making 6p in total, as well as committing to at least a 15p total dividend for the year given the projects and refinancings that we have in hand.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I'm pleased with this outcome, and Julia will give you more detail in a few minutes.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now when we first put the new plan together in June 2012, we expected FY '15 to be a relatively weak year for realizations, but subject to markets -- and that's a big but, it now looks like it could turn out to be very much better than we originally planned.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We're continuing to see a very positive shift in capital efficiency and allocation as our operating costs come down further and we reduce our interest bill.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So this is the fifth results presentation since we announced our restructuring and new strategy, and we have made material strides over that time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","After the deep restructuring in FY '13 and the resulting reduction in costs, we are now looking like a proper business, and all 3 of our divisions are performing well in terms of income this year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The asset management initiatives are having a profound impact on the performance of our portfolio of PE investments.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We continue to see significant value growth and momentum even after allowing for the rise in sterling over the last 12 months or so, and the investments we have made in recent years are performing particularly well and demonstrating the power of the 3i model in the international mid-market.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We aim to buy at sensible prices and grow our businesses to generate consistent alpha for shareholders and investors.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our strategic priorities for this year very much remain more of the same: thoughtful and well-executed asset management, careful new investment and tight cost control.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's a tough environment out there, and there is no question the macro environment across much of Europe is becoming more difficult, but I now have confidence that 3i is in a far stronger position to meet any of those challenges.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So let me close by saying another thank you to the team of 3i for all their good work in the first half and pass over to Julia.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Two questions from me.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There was an AP hit to the NAV from negative FX in the first half.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I wonder if you track how much of that might have reversed in sort of October, November, if you could give us any color on that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And the second question, the x Action, the average multiple barely changed, 9.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I wonder if you could provide any more color on the size of discounts that you're using to calculate that and how much that might have varied in the period.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You have discretion over which companies to benchmark in your averages.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Are there some sort of sectors where you're actually sort of capped on multiple that you use on the upside that then gives you cushion on the way downside? And were there any sectors, actually, where the multiples did go down? It's just dwarfed by the -- hidden by the average of being flat.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Well, I think we've put some general caution out there about the economies across Europe, in particular.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And maybe if I can touch on that and then talk about the investments specifically.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We're seeing quite a mixed bag of performance.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we find that our portfolios in Germany and Benelux are doing well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Germany, we think the economy and the shape of the companies we have, has proved quite resilient.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In Benelux, we're very exposed to the discount sector.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So whether it's Basic-Fit or whether it's Action, it's the right part of that market to be in because it's quite a tough market at the time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Scandinavia is a mixed bag.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We think Sweden is pretty strong at the moment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's quite like the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11",", we would suggest, whereas Finland is really struggling.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So Finland, we think, is really weak and has deteriorated as has France.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There's been a marked deterioration, in our view, in France this year, particularly from late spring, early summer, and we don't see any change in that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So that's why we were particularly pleased to come out of Vedici in the way that we did.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Spain, we still think, is a difficult economy.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's better than it was, but nothing's easy in Spain.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Two strong economies would be North America, in particular, and the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","-- and the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And in terms of looking at where we're putting money to the work, what we're seeing at the moment is more attractive pricing generally in North America than in Europe because there is a better balance of supply of targets in the States than there is here at the moment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we can hunt in the middle of America for these nice industrial companies that we're quite good at and find those processes are very much less competitive than anything good that happens to come up in Continental Europe.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Christ played to us because people could see we had a degree of synergy with our existing jewelry investment in Germany and, therefore, were put off competing with us for that asset.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So that was a very sensible purchase, at this time, of a very good business.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it's harder to find stuff of value in Europe at the moment, I would say, and it's more attractive in the States.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Yes, it's one my favorite jobs, is tracking the FX movements on a daily basis, and we have recouped quite a bit since the end of September.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The last time I looked, it was -- about GBP 27 million had reversed.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have given you the sensitivity, again, in the pack.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I think it's on Slide 51, where you can see what a 1% movement in the currency does based on the net assets at the 30th of September.",1395
18511,"2014m11","On the multiples, as you said, excluding Action, which -- as I explained, we didn't move the multiple.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's one of our highest multiples in the valuations at 12.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5x on a post-discount basis and it's our largest Private Equity asset.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So holding that flat with the value going up pushes up the multiple average including it.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Elsewhere, we have been doing this for a while.",1395
18511,"2014m11","When we set -- when we look at the comp sets that we're choosing, we're looking at a number of factors, things that you'd expect, the right sector, the absolute size of the company, its relative performance, the levels of leverage.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And they're pretty bespokely chosen now in terms of how we then adjust that comp set to the asset that we're trying to value.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's all the more important because the top 20 is 77% of the value.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it makes sense to be quite precise in the way that we do that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Because of that, I can't really give you sort of a thematic ""in this sector we have taken this approach.",1395
18511,"2014m11",""" We have absolutely looked at some of our businesses, where we have a view about likely exit multiple.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And as we've seen, the market move away at the beginning of this calendar year, we've effectively kept that multiple.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It doesn't mean we hold the multiples completely flat, and as I mentioned in a couple of stronger cases of our assets, we tweaked multiples up slightly, where they completed refinancing or made some progress with the transformation.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've had a number of multiples that have gone flat down in the period as well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it's quite a mixture, but the strong performance has kept the multiples overall flat.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Thank you, Simon.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I am delighted to be reporting another set of strong results.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Today's numbers demonstrate that we're continuing to do what we said we would do in the way we build value for our investors.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We delivered excellent momentum in our Private Equity portfolio, with valuated earnings growth of 17%.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've made further progress on realizations at an average money multiple of 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We're sustaining an annual cash profit, with GBP 16 million in the first half.",1395
18511,"2014m11","During the period, we invested GBP 104 million of our Proprietary Capital in Private Equity and GBP 95 million to support further fund-raising in Debt Management, and we've confirmed that we expect to pay a total dividend this year of at least 15p, the 6p of that being declared today as an interim.",1395
18511,"2014m11","NAV at the 30th of September 2014, is 358p per share.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The strong earnings momentum in Private Equity, together with realized and operating profits, increased NAV per share by 36p.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The volatility in currencies and strength in sterling continue to be a drag on the accounting return, reducing NAV by 8p, and we also paid the final dividend for financial year 2014 in July of 13.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So the corresponding movements for the second quarter are shown on this slide, which shows a very similar story.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Simon spent some time talking about investment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I'm going to focus on other aspects of the Value Build, starting with the performance of the Private Equity portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Here's our current view on the top 20 Private Equity investments, which now account for 77% of the total Proprietary Capital invested in Private Equity.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As you can see, in the significant majority of cases, current performance is positive.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There's some strong progression in our larger assets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now obviously, we can't be entirely immune to the economic conditions in some of the markets where we operate.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So, in particular, we stay cautious on investments in France and Spain.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The earnings growth is particularly strong at 17% on a valuated basis.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A key driver in that statistic is the performance of our largest asset, Action, which continues to show solid progression in its store rollout program and strong like-for-likes.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Excluding Action, the value-weighted earnings growth is still very good at 11%.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we're seeing good performance across the portfolio as a whole, and that solid performance is reflected in unrealized value growth of GBP 308 million in the first half for our Private Equity investments.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Here's the breakdown of Private Equity value growth.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As well as earnings growth, the performance category reflects movements in net debt.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The value-weighted net debt for companies valued on an earnings basis was stable at 3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Within that, we have taken the opportunity to refinance investments, such as Element and Amor, plus Action has completed a sale and leaseback of its new distribution center.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Equity markets in our principal countries for investment were down in the second quarter and over the half as well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it may seem surprising that we have GBP 13 million of value growth from multiple movements.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The weighted average multiple moved up from 9.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've held Action at 12.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5x on a post-discount level, but since its value has increased, so has its weight in the average.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Excluding Action, the weighted average multiple is broadly flat at 9.",1395
18511,"2014m11","1x, and within that, we've also taken a small number of multiples up to reflect derisking, such as refinancing or progress with an acquisition, for example.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I've talked previously about how we moderate our choice of multiples to value the portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You will recall we look at company-specific factors and our longer-term view of expectations, and we felt for some time that market multiples were trading ahead of long-term average transaction multiples.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This means that the multiples that we've used are generally lower by some margin than the straightforward comparable set would imply, and that margin acts as a cushion in volatile markets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our monthly portfolio dashboard monitoring continues to play a fundamental role in our asset management strategy.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It allows us to identify when a portfolio company is not on track so we can tackle potential issues quickly.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Of course, that doesn't mean that all our companies will always be on track, and to recognize that, as a matter of policy, we use forecast earnings to value a company if they are lower than the last 12 months' management accounts.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Reflecting our more cautious outlook in Continental Europe, the number of companies that we've used forecast earnings for has gone up from 4 in March to 7.",1395
18511,"2014m11","By value, 69% of the Private Equity portfolio is valued on an earnings basis, and these 7 companies account for 12% of that value.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The imminent sale component includes Hilite and LHi.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Both of these sales completed in October and have, therefore, been converted into cash of GBP 189 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Finally, the DCF category relates mainly to our investment in Scandlines, which has also continued to perform well since we made our further investment last year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The very good realizations we've achieved in the period have validated the strong performance of our portfolio of companies.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our exit from Vedici, a French health care business, is a good example.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The uplift to opening book of 48% reflects the uncertainty that existed at the year-end about achieving this result, which was subject to French government clearance.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we're very pleased with this outcome.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We also took the opportunity to sell a number of investments, which would not be part of our investment strategy today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A patient approach means we have still generated good money multiples in a wide range of situations, 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5x following the IPO and partial exit of Phibro, a U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","animal health care business in which we held a minority stake; 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","8x on the sale of Foster + Partners, where we've had a minority stake since 2007 and in which we've kept a loan investment; and 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","9x on the sale of the minority stake in John Hardy, a Hong Kong Chinese jewelry design and distribution business and another 2007 asset.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As I mentioned earlier, we also took advantage of positive financing markets to refinance some of our best investments, creating the opportunity for cash distribution.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You can see some of them here in Action, Element and Amor.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And since the end of the period, the completion of the Hilite and LHi exits have delivered returns of 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","9x, respectively, and we've sold 20% of our investments in Quintiles above its quoted price at the 30th of September and adding another GBP 29 million of proceeds.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A feature of this half is the lower uplift to sale than we've seen in recent periods.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As you can see from the money multiples on this slide, the 12% does not mean we're doing less successful exits.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There are 2 factors having an influence.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The Phibro, Foster + Partners and John Hardy exits were very well progressed at the 31st of March and closed early in this period.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So there's no further uplift to recognize.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And when we refinance an investment, it often results in the repayment of a portion of our original shareholder loans.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This will not result in a meaningful uplift.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It does concentrate value in the remaining equity.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now as I talked about in May, a consequence of this good realized and unrealized value growth is the need to recognize the potential for carry that's payable to our investing teams.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We're through the performance hurdles from an accounting perspective.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we accrue carry payable between 10% and 15% on our gross investment returns.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This has continued in this first half as we accrued a further GBP 45 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Again, cash paid is much lower at GBP 7 million in the period.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Importantly, strong performance from Refresco, Quintiles and a number of other assets in the growth capital fund means that we're recognizing carry receivable on that fund for the first time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've also seen strong performance from assets owned by 3i Infrastructure plc and are recognizing a performance fee there, too.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You can see the details on this slide.",1395
18511,"2014m11","One of our key targets in restructuring the business was to achieve an operating profit on a cash basis.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We achieved that key milestone in March, recording our first operating cash profit of GBP 5 million for the year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now this is not an easy target.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I'm delighted that we have made another profit in the first half of GBP 16 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I say it isn't easy because it needs continued focus on keeping costs under control whilst investing to develop fee income as well as finding sensible ways to generate cash income from a portfolio that principally delivers capital returns.",1395
18511,"2014m11","On costs, having taken the significant steps to reduce the March 2002 run rate of GBP 185 million by GBP 70 million, actual costs are now only 1% of assets under management.",1395
18511,"2014m11","With restructuring behind us, we're investing in people.",1395
18511,"2014m11","For example, we have recently recruited a number of investors in our Private Equity and Infrastructure teams and in fund investor relations in Debt Management, and we have launched our graduate program in the last 6 months.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now I've talked a lot about Private Equity so far.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This slide shows why Infrastructure and Debt Management are also important constituents of our strategic model.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The Debt Management team have had a very successful period of fund-raising in the first half, and that will underpin their excellent contribution to the operating profit from fee income, and the equity that we invest in the CLOs raised also generates a good cash yield.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our investment in 3i Infrastructure plc generates good cash dividend income, and we provide advisory services to that business.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The agreement for those services was renegotiated and agreed in July, and that agreement secures further advisory and performance fees for at least another 5 years.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The combination of Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management is important from a cash operating perspective.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's also important with respect to our Fund Management platform.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have made further improvement in the operating margin and absolute profitability of our Fund Management activities, as you can see here.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Simon has talked in detail about the new Private Equity investments we made in 2013.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We remain cautious and selective investors in these markets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In Private Equity, we made one new investment in a U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","business, now named Dynatect, and we also took an opportunity to acquire a small LP stake in Eurofund V, which increases our exposure to assets that we know very well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","After the period end, we completed a further Eurofund V investment, a German jewelry business called Christ, and another new U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","deal, Q Holdings.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Together, these investments put another GBP 196 million of shareholder capital to work.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Finally, the success of the Debt Management business in raising new CLOs in Europe and the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","has led to further equity investment of EUR 27 million and $10 million, respectively, as well as continued support for warehouses to build portfolios ahead of future CLO raises.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now in the light of the current market conditions, we remain happy being more active sellers than buyers and continuing to generate net divestment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As a result, the balance sheet continues to strengthen.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Gross debt fell as we bought back our B shares in June, and we had some benefit from euro translation of the 2017 bond.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As I said previously, it doesn't really make economic sense to reduce our gross debt further at this stage.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our credit is attractive, and investors have no obvious alternative.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So any restructure would be fully priced.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have taken advantage of financing conditions for our own revolving credit facilities.",1395
18511,"2014m11","At the beginning of September, we replaced our existing facilities of GBP 500 million, which were due to mature in 2016, with a new facility of GBP 350 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That new facility will mature at 2019 at the earliest, and improved terms and the lower amount mean that we'll save about GBP 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5 million on our annual interest bill.",1395
18511,"2014m11","With gearing at 5%, there's clearly no constraint on our ability to pay additional shareholder distributions under the policy that we've been operating since May 2012.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As a reminder, provided gross debt is less than GBP 1 billion and gearing is less than 20%, we will distribute 15% to 20% of gross realization proceeds.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That gives shareholders a direct participation in our success.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The total distribution will always be at least 8.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We call that our base dividend.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've said that levels of investments will determine whether we pay at the 15% end of the range or the 20% end of the range.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This time last year, we had an unusually clear view of the likely outturn of realizations for the full year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That view was supported by the very strong first half sales and our decision to bring forward GBP 220 million of proceeds from the previous year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This allowed us to confirm a total dividend of 20p at the half year results.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This time, we've had another strong start to the financial year with over GBP 500 million of proceeds received or on their way.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we're well on track to at least meet our previous guidance that realizations for the year would be about the same level as last year or about GBP 700 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In setting the interim dividend today, we've taken the following approach: Firstly, investment levels are improving, but they remain below our longer-term par rate.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Market conditions mean we remain cautious about investment outlook.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Therefore, we expect to be paying 20% of proceeds this year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So with GBP 542 million proceeds received so far, we will pay 20% of that, which is a pot of GBP 108 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Secondly, the cost of the base dividend is about GBP 77 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That means that the 8.",1395
18511,"2014m11","1p is already fully covered by the GBP 108 million, and we paid the base dividend 1/3, 2/3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Thirdly, this leaves GBP 31 million in the pot, funding an additional dividend to date of 3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So the 6p declared today is made up of 1/3 of 8.",1395
18511,"2014m11","1p, which is 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","7p, topped up by the 3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","3p additional.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Looking forward to the final, we'll pay the remaining 2/3 of the base, being 5.",1395
18511,"2014m11","4p, and 20% of further realizations.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And considering the visibility that we have on the realizations pipeline and subject to market conditions outside our control, we expect the total dividend for FY 2015 to be at least 15p per share, including the 6p declared today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So to sum up.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We are building value for our investors in the way that we said we would.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have excellent earnings momentum in the Private Equity portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We continue to exit well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our disciplined focus on costs means we have a positive operating cash profit again.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have made some careful new investments, and we expect our full year dividend of at least 15p, with 6p of that today declared as an interim.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Thank you very much, and we'll now go over to Q&A.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Philip? Okay.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Let me try and answer those 2 questions.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I think in -- my words of caution are really focused on the macro in certain countries and the volatility in the financial markets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","They're not focused on the performance of our companies in buckets 1 and 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have very good momentum in most of those companies, and as I said in my words, they're the sort of companies who can cope with a difficult environment, and that's what we're seeing.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So there's no stock warning about that aspect of our portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","To the second point, the bigger and the newer companies tend to be heavily represented in buckets 1 and 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So that's where the value is.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That's where the stronger momentum is.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A lot of the '07, '08 type companies are in buckets 3 and 4, if I were to generalize in that way.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Nothing we've bought recently is in bucket 4.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I can assure you of that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Thanks, Julia.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have some mics for Q&A, so if you -- this is being recorded, so if you could wait for a mic and then say your name and give us your question.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Daniel? Well, I think we've put some general caution out there about the economies across Europe, in particular.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And maybe if I can touch on that and then talk about the investments specifically.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We're seeing quite a mixed bag of performance.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we find that our portfolios in Germany and Benelux are doing well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Germany, we think the economy and the shape of the companies we have, has proved quite resilient.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In Benelux, we're very exposed to the discount sector.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So whether it's Basic-Fit or whether it's Action, it's the right part of that market to be in because it's quite a tough market at the time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Scandinavia is a mixed bag.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We think Sweden is pretty strong at the moment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's quite like the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11",", we would suggest, whereas Finland is really struggling.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So Finland, we think, is really weak and has deteriorated as has France.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There's been a marked deterioration, in our view, in France this year, particularly from late spring, early summer, and we don't see any change in that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So that's why we were particularly pleased to come out of Vedici in the way that we did.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Spain, we still think, is a difficult economy.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's better than it was, but nothing's easy in Spain.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Two strong economies would be North America, in particular, and the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","-- and the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And in terms of looking at where we're putting money to the work, what we're seeing at the moment is more attractive pricing generally in North America than in Europe because there is a better balance of supply of targets in the States than there is here at the moment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we can hunt in the middle of America for these nice industrial companies that we're quite good at and find those processes are very much less competitive than anything good that happens to come up in Continental Europe.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Christ played to us because people could see we had a degree of synergy with our existing jewelry investment in Germany and, therefore, were put off competing with us for that asset.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So that was a very sensible purchase, at this time, of a very good business.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it's harder to find stuff of value in Europe at the moment, I would say, and it's more attractive in the States.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it's still sensible to assume high single-digit to low double-digit earnings growth? Thank you, Simon.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I am delighted to be reporting another set of strong results.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Today's numbers demonstrate that we're continuing to do what we said we would do in the way we build value for our investors.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We delivered excellent momentum in our Private Equity portfolio, with value-weighted earnings growth of 17%.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've made further progress on realizations at an average money multiple of 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We're sustaining an annual cash profit, with GBP 16 million in the first half.",1395
18511,"2014m11","During the period, we invested GBP 104 million of our Proprietary Capital in Private Equity and GBP 95 million to support further fund-raising in Debt Management, and we've confirmed that we expect to pay a total dividend this year of at least 15p, with 6p of that being declared today as an interim.",1395
18511,"2014m11","NAV at the 30th of September 2014, is 358p per share.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The strong earnings momentum in Private Equity, together with realized and operating profits, increased NAV per share by 36p.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The volatility in currencies and strength in sterling continue to be a drag on the accounting return, reducing NAV by 8p, and we also paid the final dividend for financial year 2014 in July of 13.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So the corresponding movements for the second quarter are shown on this slide, which shows a very similar story.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Simon spent some time talking about investment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I'm going to focus on other aspects of the Value Build, starting with the performance of the Private Equity portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Here's our current view on the top 20 Private Equity investments, which now account for 77% of the total Proprietary Capital invested in Private Equity.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As you can see, in the significant majority of cases, current performance is positive with some strong progression in our larger assets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now obviously, we can't be entirely immune to the economic conditions in some of the markets where we operate.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So, in particular, we stay cautious on investments in France and Spain.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The earnings growth is particularly strong at 17% on a value-weighted basis.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A key driver in that statistic is the performance of our largest asset, Action, which continues to show solid progression in its store rollout program and strong like-for-likes.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Excluding Action, the value-weighted earnings growth is still very good at 11%.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we're seeing good performance across the portfolio as a whole, and that solid performance is reflected in unrealized value growth of GBP 308 million in the first half for our Private Equity investments.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Here's the breakdown of Private Equity value growth.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As well as earnings growth, the performance category reflects movements in net debt.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The value-weighted net debt for companies valued on an earnings basis was stable at 3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Within that, we have taken the opportunity to refinance investments, such as Element and Amor, plus Action has completed a sale and leaseback of its new distribution center.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Equity markets in our principal countries for investment were down in the second quarter and over the half as well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it may seem surprising that we have GBP 13 million of value growth from multiple movements.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The weighted average multiple moved up from 9.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've held Action at 12.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5x on a post-discount level, but since its value has increased, so has its weight in the average.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Excluding Action, the weighted average multiple is broadly flat at 9.",1395
18511,"2014m11","1x, and within that, we've also taken a small number of multiples up to reflect derisking, such as refinancing or progress with an acquisition, for example.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I've talked previously about how we moderate our choice of multiples to value the portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You will recall we look at company-specific factors and our longer-term view of expectations, and we felt for some time that market multiples were trading ahead of long-term average transaction multiples.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This means that the multiples that we've used are generally lower by some margin than the straightforward comparable set would imply, and that margin acts as a cushion in volatile markets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our monthly portfolio dashboard monitoring continues to play a fundamental role in our asset management strategy.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It allows us to identify when a portfolio company is not on track so we can tackle potential issues quickly.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Of course, that doesn't mean that all our companies will always be on track, and to recognize that, as a matter of policy, we use forecast earnings to value a company if they are lower than the last 12 months' management accounts.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Reflecting our more cautious outlook in Continental Europe, the number of companies that we've used forecast earnings for has gone up from 4 in March to 7.",1395
18511,"2014m11","By value, 69% of the Private Equity portfolio is valued on an earnings basis, and these 7 companies account for 12% of that value.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The imminent sale component includes Hilite and LHi.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Both of these sales completed in October and have, therefore, been converted into cash of GBP 189 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Finally, the DCF category relates mainly to our investment in Scandlines, which has also continued to perform well since we made our further investment last year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The very good realizations we've achieved in the period have validated the strong performance of our portfolio of companies.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our exit from Vedici, a French health care business, is a good example.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The uplift to opening book of 48% reflects the uncertainty that existed at the year-end about achieving this result, which was subject to French government clearance.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we're very pleased with this outcome.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We also took the opportunity to sell a number of investments, which would not be part of our investment strategy today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A patient approach means we have still generated good money multiples in a wide range of situations, 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5x following the IPO and partial exit of Phibro, a U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","animal health care business in which we held a minority stake; 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","8x on the sale of Foster + Partners, where we've had a minority stake since 2007 and in which we've kept a loan investment; and 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","9x on the sale of the minority stake in John Hardy, a Hong Kong Chinese jewelry design and distribution business and another 2007 asset.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As I mentioned earlier, we also took advantage of positive financing markets to refinance some of our best investments, creating the opportunity for cash distribution.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You can see some of them here in Action, Element and Amor.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And since the end of the period, the completion of the Hilite and LHi exits have delivered returns of 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","9x, respectively, and we've sold 20% of our investments in Quintiles above its quoted price at the 30th of September and adding another GBP 29 million of proceeds.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A feature of this half is the lower uplift to sale than we've seen in recent periods.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As you can see from the money multiples on this slide, the 12% does not mean we're doing less successful exits.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There are 2 factors having an influence.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The Phibro, Foster + Partners and John Hardy exits were very well progressed at the 31st of March and closed early in this period.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So there's no further uplift to recognize.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And when we refinance an investment, it often results in the repayment of a portion of our original shareholder loans.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This will not result in a meaningful uplift.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It does concentrate value in the remaining equity.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now as I talked about in May, a consequence of this good realized and unrealized value growth is the need to recognize the potential for carry that's payable to our investing teams.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We're through the performance hurdles from an accounting perspective.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we accrue carry payable between 10% and 15% on our gross investment returns.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This has continued in this first half as we accrued a further GBP 45 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Again, cash paid is much lower at GBP 7 million in the period.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Importantly, strong performance from Refresco, Quintiles and a number of other assets in the growth capital fund means that we're recognizing carry receivable on that fund for the first time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've also seen strong performance from assets owned by 3i Infrastructure plc and are recognizing a performance fee there, too.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You can see the details on this slide.",1395
18511,"2014m11","One of our key targets in restructuring the business was to achieve an operating profit on a cash basis.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We achieved that key milestone in March, recording our first operating cash profit of GBP 5 million for the year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now this is not an easy target.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I'm delighted that we have made another profit in the first half of GBP 16 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I say it isn't easy because it needs continued focus on keeping costs under control whilst investing to develop fee income as well as finding sensible ways to generate cash income from a portfolio that principally delivers capital returns.",1395
18511,"2014m11","On costs, having taken the significant steps to reduce the March 2002 run rate of GBP 185 million by GBP 70 million, actual costs are now only 1% of assets under management.",1395
18511,"2014m11","With restructuring behind us, we're investing in people.",1395
18511,"2014m11","For example, we have recently recruited a number of investors in our Private Equity and Infrastructure teams and in fund investor relations in Debt Management, and we have launched our graduate program in the last 6 months.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now I've talked a lot about Private Equity so far.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This slide shows why Infrastructure and Debt Management are also important constituents of our strategic model.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The Debt Management team have had a very successful period of fund-raising in the first half, and that will underpin their excellent contribution to the operating profit from fee income, and the equity that we invest in the CLOs raised also generates a good cash yield.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our investment in 3i Infrastructure plc generates good cash dividend income, and we provide advisory services to that business.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The agreement for those services was renegotiated and agreed in July, and that agreement secures further advisory and performance fees for at least another 5 years.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The combination of Private Equity, Infrastructure and Debt Management is important from a cash operating perspective.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's also important with respect to our Fund Management platform.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have made further improvement in the operating margin and absolute profitability of our Fund Management activities, as you can see here.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Simon has talked in detail about the new Private Equity investments we made in 2013.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We remain cautious and selective investors in these markets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In Private Equity, we made one new investment in a U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","business, now named Dynatect, and we also took an opportunity to acquire a small LP stake in Eurofund V, which increases our exposure to assets that we know very well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","After the period end, we completed a further Eurofund V investment, a German jewelry business called Christ, and another new U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","deal, Q Holdings.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Together, these investments put another GBP 196 million of shareholder capital to work.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Finally, the success of the Debt Management business in raising new CLOs in Europe and the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","has led to further equity investment of EUR 27 million and $10 million, respectively, as well as continued support for warehouses to build portfolios ahead of future CLO raises.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now in the light of the current market conditions, we remain happy being more active sellers than buyers and continuing to generate net divestment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As a result, the balance sheet continues to strengthen.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Gross debt fell as we bought back our B shares in June, and we had some benefit from euro translation of the 2017 bond.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As I said previously, it doesn't really make economic sense to reduce our gross debt further at this stage.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our credit is attractive, and investors have no obvious alternative.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So any restructure would be fully priced.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have taken advantage of financing conditions for our own revolving credit facilities.",1395
18511,"2014m11","At the beginning of September, we replaced our existing facilities of GBP 500 million, which were due to mature in 2016, with a new facility of GBP 350 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That new facility will mature at 2019 at the earliest, and improved terms and the lower amount mean that we'll save about GBP 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5 million on our annual interest bill.",1395
18511,"2014m11","With gearing at 5%, there's clearly no constraint on our ability to pay additional shareholder distributions under the policy that we've been operating since May 2012.",1395
18511,"2014m11","As a reminder, provided gross debt is less than GBP 1 billion and gearing is less than 20%, we will distribute 15% to 20% of gross realization proceeds.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That gives shareholders a direct participation in our success.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The total distribution will always be at least 8.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We call that our base dividend.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've said that levels of investments will determine whether we pay at the 15% end of the range or the 20% end of the range.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This time last year, we had an unusually clear view of the likely outturn of realizations for the full year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That view was supported by the very strong first half sales and our decision to bring forward GBP 220 million of proceeds from the previous year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This allowed us to confirm a total dividend of 20p at the half year results.",1395
18511,"2014m11","This time, we've had another strong start to the financial year with over GBP 500 million of proceeds received or on their way.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we're well on track to at least meet our previous guidance that realizations for the year would be about the same level as last year or about GBP 700 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In setting the interim dividend today, we've taken the following approach: Firstly, investment levels are improving, but they remain below our longer-term par rate.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Market conditions mean we remain cautious about investment outlook.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Therefore, we expect to be paying 20% of proceeds this year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So with GBP 542 million proceeds received so far, we will pay 20% of that, which is a pot of GBP 108 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Secondly, the cost of the base dividend is about GBP 77 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That means that the 8.",1395
18511,"2014m11","1p is already fully covered by the GBP 108 million, and we paid the base dividend 1/3, 2/3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Thirdly, this leaves GBP 31 million in the pot, funding an additional dividend to date of 3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So the 6p declared today is made up of 1/3 of 8.",1395
18511,"2014m11","1p, which is 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","7p, topped up by the 3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","3p additional.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Looking forward to the final, we'll pay the remaining 2/3 of the base, being 5.",1395
18511,"2014m11","4p, and 20% of further realizations.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And considering the visibility that we have on the realizations pipeline and subject to market conditions outside our control, we expect the total dividend for FY 2015 to be at least 15p per share, including the 6p declared today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So to sum up.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We are building value for our investors in the way that we said we would.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have excellent earnings momentum in the Private Equity portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We continue to exit well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our disciplined focus on costs means we have a positive operating cash profit again.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have made some careful new investments, and we expect our full year dividend of at least 15p, with 6p of that today declared as an interim.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Thank you very much, and we'll now go over to Q&A.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Caz.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Just on the new investments, to what extent did your new co-investors take part in those? Yes, it's one of my favorite jobs, is tracking the FX movements on a daily basis, and we have recouped quite a bit since the end of September.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The last time I looked, it was -- about GBP 27 million had reversed.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have given you the sensitivity, again, in the pack.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I think it's on Slide 51, where you can see what a 1% movement in the currency does based on the net assets at the 30th of September.",1395
18511,"2014m11","On the multiples, as you said, excluding Action, which -- as I explained, we didn't move the multiple.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's one of our highest multiples in the valuations at 12.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5x on a post-discount basis and it's our largest Private Equity asset.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So holding that flat with the value going up pushes up the multiple average including it.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Elsewhere, we have been doing this for a while.",1395
18511,"2014m11","When we set -- when we look at the comp sets that we're choosing, we're looking at a number of factors, things that you'd expect, the right sector, the absolute size of the company, its relative performance, the levels of leverage.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And they're pretty bespokely chosen now in terms of how we then adjust that comp set to the asset that we're trying to value.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's all the more important because the top 20 is 77% of the value.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it makes sense to be quite precise in the way that we do that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Because of that, I can't really give you sort of a thematic ""in this sector we have taken this approach.",1395
18511,"2014m11",""" We have absolutely looked at some of our businesses, where we have a view about likely exit multiple.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And as we've seen, the market move away at the beginning of this calendar year, we've effectively capped that multiple.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It doesn't mean we hold the multiples completely flat, and as I mentioned in a couple of stronger cases of our assets, we've tweaked the multiples up slightly, where they completed refinancing or made some progress with the transformation.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've had a number of multiples that have gone flat down in the period as well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So it's quite a mixture, but the strong performance has kept the multiples overall flat.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Do you want to do both? On what we're seeing at the moment, I would certainly think so.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I think the caution around the environment is more about realizations and refinancings.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There's confidences required for those things.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have a lot of stuff in train.",1395
18511,"2014m11","If things don't change, that will be great, but if we have another October rolling out for 3 or 4 months, then it will obviously impact all sorts of markets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Any others? Okay, thanks for coming along today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Much appreciated.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I mean, we all know that with various complexions, Continental Europe is struggling.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So are you saying that the opportunities that are being pushed away don't fully reflect what is going on in underlying economies? In terms of Christ, it's actually deemed a further investment in Eurofund V.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we did that together with the LPs in Eurofund V.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The other 2 investments, the North American investments, were 3i investments.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Philip? Okay.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Let me try and answer those 2 questions.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I think in -- my words of caution are really focused on the macro in certain countries and the volatility in the financial markets.",1395
18511,"2014m11","They're not focused on the performance of our companies in buckets 1 and 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have very good momentum in most of those companies, and as I said in my words, they're the sort of companies who can cope with a difficult environment, and that's what we're seeing.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So there's no stark warning about that aspect of our portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","To the second point, the bigger and the newer companies tend to be heavily represented in buckets 1 and 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So that's where the value is.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That's where the stronger momentum is.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A lot of the '07, '08 type companies are in buckets 3 and 4, if I were to generalize in that way.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Nothing we've bought recently is in bucket 4.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I can assure you of that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I think it was reflective of the asset value at March and under the asset value at September.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Any more questions? Yes, one at the front here.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Two questions from me.",1395
18511,"2014m11","There was an 8p hit to the NAV from negative FX in the first half.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I wonder if you track how much of that might have reversed in sort of October, November, if you could give us any color on that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And the second question, the x Action, the average multiple barely changed, 9.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I wonder if you could provide any more color on the size of discounts that you're using to calculate that and how much that might have varied in the period.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You have discretion over which companies to benchmark in your averages.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Are there some sort of sectors where you're actually sort of capped on multiple that you use on the upside that then gives you cushion on the way downside? And were there any sectors actually where the multiples did go down that's just dwarfed by the -- hidden by the average of being flat.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to 3i's Interim Results.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've had another good first half, with solid results across the group.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Despite the tricky macro and volatile stock markets, we're building real value growth across our investment portfolios.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've seen a good level of realization activity, and we've made some important new investments in North America and Germany.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And we have made good progress with group KPIs, with further reductions in operating and interest costs.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've also delivered a growing base of cash realizations to underpin this year's dividend.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We secured GBP 324 million of realizations in the first half and another GBP 218 million of cash since then, including the successful placing of some of our stock in Quintiles last week.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The portfolio has performed well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In fact, we've seen GBP 360 million of value growth and income based on strong earnings momentum in our larger investments, such as Action and Element.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Operating costs are now running at 1% of AUM compared to 1.",1395
18511,"2014m11","6% in 2012.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That's very much in line with or better than industry benchmarks, and this has helped in increasing our first half Fund Management profit of GBP 13 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now as you know, I took over as CEO in May 2012, and we announced a new strategy for the group in June 2012.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Well, we've come a long a way since then, and I'm pleased to say there is very strong momentum in the group today.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Even with adverse foreign currency markets, we've produced a good recovery in total returns underpinned by strong asset management and realization performance, a substantial reduction in costs and much improved cash flow.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That's the stuff that pays dividends to shareholders and cash back to LPs.",1395
18511,"2014m11","You should now all be familiar with our strategy.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's simple and it includes all 3 of our businesses.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The combination of our complementary asset management capabilities across 3 platforms, together with our permanent capital, gives our shareholders a clearly differentiated and attractive value proposition.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now I'd like to use the 3i Value Build, which we first presented in 2012, as the structure for today's presentation.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I'll comment on each of the steps, starting with portfolio earnings.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Here are the 4 3i buckets, which I used to analyze the Private Equity portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I've set down some examples for each bucket and the percentage of value using the 30th September values that each bucket accounts for.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Back in May 2012, 3i had 130 investments, with too many in buckets 3 and 4.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we've been on a journey with the aim of reducing that number of investments down to 40 or less, with those 40 comprising the 2 stronger buckets, 1 and 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've had another good run of realizations, and the majority of which have come from our non-core buckets 3 and 4.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So the overall portfolio is increasingly dominated by our keepers or higher-value potential assets in bucket 1 or our strong performers in bucket 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","In fact, the value weighted average LTM earnings growth of 17% across the portfolio is driven by the strong growth we are seeing across our larger investments in buckets 1 and 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","While our companies in the top 2 buckets are more able to cope with the challenging macro climate, it is not always the case for those companies in buckets 3 and 4, but the strong market for realizations, which is underpinned by QE and lots of dry powder potential buyers, has meant we have been able to trade out a number of our weaker or non-core companies at attractive valuations.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our mid-market PE portfolio has good earnings momentum, which compares very favorably with stock market comparables or, indeed, other PE portfolios and will underpin significant cash distributions from the group over the coming years.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've overhauled our approach to asset management in 2012 and introducing 6 new initiatives and much greater proactivity across the portfolio.",1395
18511,"2014m11","These changes, which encompassed our monthly dashboard monitoring and more rigorous exit planning, are an important factor in the resilient performance of the portfolio we're seeing today, and I thought this would be a useful time to look at the investments we made last year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We made 4 investments, 3 new and 1 large follow-on in Scandlines, and despite the competition for good assets, we bought them well at attractive entry multiples, an average across the 4 of 8x EBITDA.",1395
18511,"2014m11","All are performing in line or ahead of plan, with average earnings growth of 23% over the last 12 months.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And I'd now like to give you a look at each of those investments.",1395
18511,"2014m11","GIF is a German testing and engineering business focused on transmission systems in the automotive sector.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We know the testing and automotive sectors extremely well, and GIF is a classic German Mittelstand business.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our long-term plan is to reposition the business as much more of a pure-play testing business with the value-added engineering capability and to continue its drive for international expansion.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The plan is going well, with the business expecting to generate EBITDA growth of 25% for the current financial year and a good buildup of sales in the China operation, in particular.",1395
18511,"2014m11","JMJ is a global leader in safety consultancy and works for major oil, industrial and aerospace companies around the world.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The business is based out of Austin, Texas, but it has a U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It is a sector leader and is capable of significant international expansion as well as growing through entering new sectors.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It enjoys strong levels of organic growth and has a very blue-chip roster of major clients, such as Chevron, Shell and Lend Lease.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The business was introduced to us by the Chairman of Element, which gave us the chance to buy the company away from an auction process.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now I talked about Basic-Fit and its founder, Rene Moos, last year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's our discount gym format in the Benelux.",1395
18511,"2014m11","If you like, it's our Action of the gym world.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Again, we purchased Basic-Fit away from a competitive process and have enjoyed some spectacular growth in the company's first year under our ownership, with 42 new clubs and a likely increase of over 50% in EBITDA this year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We are now the market leader in both Holland and Belgium and have just started to open gyms in France and Spain.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So our new investments are performing well, and we have sensible in prices against which to target our money multiple returns.",1395
18511,"2014m11","GIF and JMJ are classic bucket 2 investments, and it's already pretty clear that Basic-Fit is more likely to be a bucket 1 candidate.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've delivered another good run of realizations and refinancings in the first half, and Julia will be giving you more detail on this in her section.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've continued to focus on disposals of non-core assets, with just one sale from bucket 2 in the first half and another 2, Hilite and LHi, closing last month.",1395
18511,"2014m11","At the 30th of September, we had reduced the number of investments to 72.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now I'd also like to talk about 2 of those bucket 2 disposals, Vedici and Hilite.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Vedici, a French hospital group, was sold in September to CVC, netting 3i GBP 83 million of proceeds and a 2x money multiple in 4 years.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now France is a very difficult market at present, and our Paris team did a great job in securing this exit on these terms.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We made a 48% profit over our March '14 book value on this sale.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Hilite, a German automotive group which we bought in 2011, was another classic bucket 2 asset.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We refocused the group, investing in R&D and expanding geographic sales through China, in particular.",1395
18511,"2014m11","1x our money through a very competitive auction process, eventually selling to a Chinese company, AVIC Electromechanical Systems, at the end of October.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now moving to the group.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our operating cash profit continued its improving trajectory in the first half at GBP 16 million.",1395
18511,"2014m11","That reflects a further reduction in the cost base and improving income performance across our 3 businesses.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Debt Management has made a good contribution to that income.",1395
18511,"2014m11","To date, they have issued 4 CLOs, 2 in the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and 2 in Europe, as well as growing their U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Senior Loan Fund and achieving a first close on a European Middle Market Loan Fund at EUR 250 million this week.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The Infrastructure team has also had a productive first half, seeing strong growth in its core European portfolio and securing a steady flow of primary PPP investment opportunities as well as developing a pipeline of potential new core infrastructure projects.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The India Fund has remained challenging despite the election this year, but we did manage to sell some of our holding in Adani Power in firmer markets around the time of the election there.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Importantly, the Infrastructure team agreed an extension to the investment advisory agreement with 3iN at the beginning of the financial year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our strong balance sheet has facilitated further investments this year, which will provide good capital growth as well as income going forward.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've made 2 new PE investments in the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","this year as well as a further investment in Germany.",1395
18511,"2014m11","These are 2 of the stronger economies we're operating in today, and I am pleased we're increasing the group's exposure to the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and Germany at this time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","All 3 investments are decent-sized businesses, where we are confident of meeting our 2x return target on in prices of between 8.",1395
18511,"2014m11","5 and 9x EBITDA.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We took an opportunity to purchase an LP position in Eurofund V, increasing 3i's ownership to 57% of a fund that is now recovering very strongly, and on the income front, we have seeded 4 new CLOs as well as establishing new warehouse facilities for the further CLO launches.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We purchased Dynatect in August this year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Dynatect is a U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","-based manufacturer of protective equipment, with operations in the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and Germany.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The industrial sector has been 3i's most consistent performer over many years, and the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and Germany have been key to that performance.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've also signed an agreement to buy Q Holdings, another U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","group focused on the manufacture of precision-molded rubber and silicone components.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It has 6 manufacturing plants across the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and China as well as sales offices in Germany and Mexico.",1395
18511,"2014m11","A key part of our plan is to help the business grow organically and by acquisition in Europe.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've also announced the purchase of Christ, a leading retailer of watches and jewelry in Germany.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We have an existing presence in this segment through Amor, our existing jewelry business, and we've been tracking Christ for some time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So far, realization progress has been good, with over GBP 540 million of cash from sales and refinancings, and we have a good number of sales and refinancings in progress at the moment.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So today, we're announcing an interim dividend of 2.",1395
18511,"2014m11","7p and an additional dividend of 3.",1395
18511,"2014m11","3p, making 6p in total, as well as committing to at least a 15p total dividend for the year given the projects and refinancings that we have in hand.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I'm pleased with this outcome, and Julia will give you more detail in a few minutes.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Now when we first put the new plan together in June 2012, we expected FY '15 to be a relatively weak year for realizations, but subject to markets -- and that's a big but, it now looks like it could turn out to be very much better than we originally planned.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We're continuing to see a very positive shift in capital efficiency and allocation as our operating costs come down further and we reduce our interest bill.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So this is the fifth results presentation since we announced our restructuring and new strategy, and we have made material strides over that time.",1395
18511,"2014m11","After the deep restructuring in FY '13 and the resulting reduction in costs, we are now looking like a proper business, and all 3 of our divisions are performing well in terms of income this year.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The asset management initiatives are having a profound impact on the performance of our portfolio of PE investments.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We continue to see significant value growth and momentum even after allowing for the rise in sterling over the last 12 months or so, and the investments we have made in recent years are performing particularly well and demonstrating the power of the 3i model in the international mid-market.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We aim to buy at sensible prices and grow our businesses to generate consistent alpha for shareholders and investors.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Our strategic priorities for this year very much remain more of the same: thoughtful and well-executed asset management, careful new investment and tight cost control.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's a tough environment out there, and there is no question the macro environment across much of Europe is becoming more difficult, but I now have confidence that 3i is in a far stronger position to meet any of those challenges.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So let me close by saying another thank you to the team of 3i for all their good work in the first half and pass over to Julia.",1395
18511,"2014m11","It's Justin Thomson from T.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Rowe Price.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I guess, in both yours and Julia's presentation, the thread was talking about new investments of caution.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I'm just wondering what informs that view.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I think in the Debt Management business, we're moving through, what I would call, the low point in that, if you like, CLO -- old CLOs are coming off as we write new CLOs.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I think we're moving into net positive territory.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So you will see decent growth going forward if we remain at the same rate of issuance, and we'll also see good growth coming from non-CLO funds.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I referred to 2 in the results today, the U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Senior Loan Fund and the new Middle Market Fund in Europe, where they've just done a first close.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we're investing in that business to grow that, and providing we can stay at the same rate of issuance that we've seen, we do expect those numbers to move forward quite well.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Chris? Up at the front here.",1395
18511,"2014m11","We've probably bailed out of half a dozen processes at least this year, where the pricing has got away from us fairly quickly and we've just been uncomfortable with that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So I would say, average pricing in the mid-market, where we're looking, is above 10x in Europe, and the better stuff is going for even higher than that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","And I'm just not convinced that 2x on that sort of level is going to be that easy with the outlook that we have.",1395
18511,"2014m11","So we are running out in those processes quite quickly.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Over at the back.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I wonder if you could say a little bit about the Fund Management business, in particular the economics of that and the operating leverage in that.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Do you feel you've got the Infrastructure you need in place here, and therefore, new CLO launches, et cetera, just add top line and profitability? Or do you still think you need to do some investing in that business? It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Just a couple of questions.",1395
18511,"2014m11","The first one is with regards to the earnings growth of the company, obviously, there's been quite a lot of caution today in your remarks.",1395
18511,"2014m11","I'm just trying to think, x Action, it was 11% earnings growth.",1395
18511,"2014m11","Obviously, 75% of the portfolio is U.",1395
18511,"2014m11","and Europe.",1395
18511,"2014m11","How should -- what's your sort of expectation for the next 12 months in terms of earnings growth for those sort of companies? And then the way you kind of split the buckets, 1 to 4, could you give us a sense of the vintages in each of those buckets now? And just another question, would you be able to disclose what sort of price relative to asset value was paid for the stake in Eurofund V?",1395
18511,"2014m5","It's very much on price.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have the best pipeline of potential new investments that I've seen since I've joined 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we're getting a good look at quite a lot of stuff.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But we're discarding quite a lot because of the relationship of price and expectation.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Any more? One at the front.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So there was a refinancing in Action in the first half, and actually because that restructure, that came back as proceeds to us.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we received GBP 59 million of proceeds in the first half.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As I said, it's got very good free cash flow, and post that refinancing, it's net debt, it's now down to 3.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we will obviously continue to look at ways of making sure that that's the most efficient, and could be looking at for the refinancings in the future.",1473
18511,"2014m5","To give you a rough guidance, and I'll give it to you, from March to March, the value at March was 280 [PH], and as you correctly say, the value at the end of this month actually, it was 501 [PH].",1473
18511,"2014m5","There are -- the really important dynamic in Action is the strong earnings growth that we see, both in very good like-for-likes but also, the store rollout program that they've got.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And as I've talked about, they have just gotten earnings of these valuations by adding a sort of pro forma on stores being opened and that's the run rate basis that we're using.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And then as I've said, we've also taken decision to step up the multiple to recognize that growth rate.",1473
18511,"2014m5","If you look at the movement from March to March, there is more benefit coming from the earnings growth than the multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's a shape beyond -- the 50% comes from earnings, there's probably, about 55, 45 something like that.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Thanks, Simon, and good morning, everybody.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This has been a year of strong delivery, and we've generated real momentum.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And you can see the evidence in the results that Simon and I are talking about today.",1473
18511,"2014m5","One point I want to note, just at the start, this year, we've adopted in a new accounting standards.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It has no effect on the results, but it changes the components of our returns, balance sheets and cash flow, and that means that the audited financial statutory statements actually look very different.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And it's a bit hard to see the detailed picture.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we decided that it would be more helpful to present the numbers today on the basis that's consistent with previous periods.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We believe that this makes our results easier to understand, and we're calling this our investment basis.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that's what we used in our press release this morning as well.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'm not going to go through the change in detail here today.",1473
18511,"2014m5","There's an explanation and the reconciliation in the press release, and some explanatory slides in the back of your packs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Of course, I'm happy to take any questions at the end of the presentation.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But enough of the technicalities.",1473
18511,"2014m5","3% total return we have delivered is a great result.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And almost so, because the numbers are after the headwind of Sterling's strength, which I'll come onto in a minute.",1473
18511,"2014m5","At a group level, we have achieved an annual cash operating profit of GBP 5 [PH] million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is an important milestone.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It demonstrates that our financial model is far more sustainable, and that we can make capital allocation decisions without leakage from our cost base.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As you know and Simon confirmed a minute ago, we've made good progress in reducing our costs, but staying focused on the cash operating profit, means we won't lose sight of this operational efficiency.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As well as efficiency, we've built momentum for growth during the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have put up the proprietary capital to work, making cash investment of GBP 337 million in Private Equity and Debt Management.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we've continued to strengthen the balance sheet.",1473
18511,"2014m5","With the realizations of GBP 677 million of good money multiples, and a further reduction in gross debt to GBP 857 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're now giving more information about the profitability of our fund management platform, and this is for the first time.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'm going to take you through that in more detail later, but note here, the fee income is stable, and we've improved both profitability and margin.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We closed the period with NAV per share of 348p.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And you can see here how that has progressed since December, and over the course of the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Very strong performance from our Private Equity portfolio in realizations and portfolio value growth, significant reductions in our cost base and interest bill, mean that the dilution of those returns is dramatically lower.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But there is a reduction, from the increase in our carry provision because of the strong portfolio performance, and in FX translation loss as sterling ha strengthened.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Finally, we paid 1/3 of our proposed 20p dividend in January, and together with last year's final dividend, that gives you the 12.",1473
18511,"2014m5","1p that you can see here.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So first, let's look at the performance of our Private Equity business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The GBP 647 million gross investment return that we've generated, is 24% over opening portfolio valuation of GBP 2.",1473
18511,"2014m5","7 billion, and within that, the return from the core Northern European and North American portfolio was excellent, at 30%.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that now accounts the 90% of the total portfolio value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Simon talked about some of the significant realizations that that have driven very nice profits of GBP 201 million, and the uplift of 43% over opening value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Just to note, as you may have already seen in the press release, we're now reporting gross investment return after foreign exchange movements on the portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So the GBP 647 million that you can see here, is net of a translation loss of GBP 100 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So what are the drivers of the unrealized value growth? 
The weighted average 12 months earnings growth for those companies that we value using earnings was 19%, driven particularly by the assets in our keepers bucket, such as Action an Element.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We talked a lot around the Q3 [PH] IMS, about cautioned and following the market up, when we set our valuation multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is still the case, but we will re-rate the companies, if we think the performance and our expectations about exit potential merit it.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'm going to show separately about how we valued Action in a minute, because it has a big affect on the numbers that you can see here.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Before I do, please also note, the low level of companies that are being valued using forecast earnings.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We do that then earnings are lower than the last 12 months to anticipate a downturn in performance.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So a low number here, just 3% by value, is a good metric.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Net debt in the portfolio stayed low at an average of 3.",1473
18511,"2014m5","1x, and 79% of that debt is now due up to 2016, as we've taken opportunities to refinance.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So there's been quite a lot of focus on our investment in Action.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It is clearly immaterial part of the book, so I'm going to give you some more specific details about how we valued it.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've been using the run rate adjusted earning since 
[Audio Gap]
to reflect the significant growth in the business from store openings.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The success of the management team in that store rollout and strong like-for-likes, now gives us the confidence to reset the comparable multiples, and to include high-growth companies which we've previously excluded.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And of course, the recent IPO of pound [PH] land has given us any data point.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we've increased the post discount multiple from 10x to 12.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Action generates very good free cash flow, and after the refinancing that we did last summer, it's net debt is only 3.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Having made these changes, we now hold Action in our books at a value of GBP 501 million, which is 14.",1473
18511,"2014m5","1% of our portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","All other things being equal, at the 31st of March, an increase in the multiple from 12.",1473
18511,"2014m5","15x [PH] to 13.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5x, would increase our book value by GBP 50 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And by the way, this is one of the reasons why we're putting a resolution at the AGM to amend our investment policy.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Since our keeper assets demonstrate strong growth, we have a so-called nice problem to have, that a single asset could account for more than 15% [PH] of portfolio value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that's a limit in our current investment policy.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now we don't think it makes sense for us to have to reduce an investment if we think there is better shareholder value to be had by keeping the investment for longer.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we're proposing to change the limit to apply it to investment costs rather than value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Coming back to the valuations in total, you can see here how the earnings growth and stable net debt in the portfolio as a whole, means strong growth of GBP 182 million from performance.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The single biggest driver of the GBP 216 million increase in value from multiples is that decision to increase the Action multiple.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Valuation of Scandlines is included in the DCF line, and since the further investment and appointment of the new Chairman, we're positive about the outlook for this business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The combined value of the old and new money has increased by GBP 21 million since that acquisition.",1473
18511,"2014m5","In the credit [PH] portfolio, particularly Quintiles, and Gain Capital in the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5",", have performed very well in the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But this strong performance overall, the top 20 Private Equity assets, now accounts for 76% of the total Private Equity portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Here they are.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And you can see there's only a few exceptions where our view is not positive on performance.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that is generally true in the remainder of the portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As we've had another year with no provisions or material write-downs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","A consequence of this strong performance is that the provision to remain for carry payable has stepped up materially in the last quarter.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we pay carry on our proprietary capital investment to the investment teams at rates of between 10% and 15%, in schemes set the 2 years.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Every quarter, we test each scheme ot see whether it would've hit its performance hurdle, if it's sold on the assets of the balance sheet value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And if it has, they make accrue carry as if assets are being sold.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But we discount it to reflect the actual payment date maybe many years into the future.",1473
18511,"2014m5","When a scheme hits the hurdle for the first time, there's also catch-up effect.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The 2010 [PH] to 2012 assets have performed particularly strongly.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This scheme includes Action, and it's hit its hurdle for the first time this year on a accruals basis.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Rate on the scheme is just below 15%, and the provision for this scheme makes up the biggest part of the charge.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We received carry on third-party capital over the life of the relevant fund, some of which is then shared with the investment teams.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The performance of Eurofund V has improved dramatically, with the current fund multiple increasing to 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","13x at the 31st of March.",1473
18511,"2014m5","However, that's not a strong enough recovery, to let it start accruing for carry receivable on this month.",1473
18511,"2014m5","In fact, the drag from the 2007 to 2009 investments in this bond, means we haven't recognized it's carry receivable yet.",1473
18511,"2014m5","In cash terms, carry paid and carry received on cash realizations schemes actually there hurdles was much lower at GBP 25 million and GBP 5 million, respectively.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Let me now turn in infrastructure, where it has been comparatively quieter year, although as you have seen from our infrastructure the results last week, there have been some good developments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're building our PPP capability, and progress on the renewal of our advisory agreement with 3iN.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our 34% shareholding in 3iN delivers good dividend income.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We received GBP 21 million this year, a very important underpin to our cash profit metric.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The core European portfolio continues to perform well, but the performance of the Indian portfolio has been disappointing.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The value of our direct holding in these investments fell by 25%, and that includes the significant rupee and dollar depreciation in the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The PPP platform already covers its costs and Further fundraising by that team might also make a positive contribution to the cash profit metric and the group's fund management profitability.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our debt management business has the biggest contributor to that fund management profitability.",1473
18511,"2014m5","During the year, it closed 2 new CLOs in Europe, and 2 in the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that added GBP 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","2 billion assets under management, and offset the run off of the older funds.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We finished the year with assets under management of GBP 6.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Fee income was stable at GBP 32 million, but as I said at the half-year, the catch-up fees on older funds contributed GBP 6 million last year, and they no longer feature.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Excluding these catch-up fees, fee income grew by GBP 7 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So an overall improvement in the quality of earnings.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Bringing together fund management contributions from all our businesses, you can see the profitability of 3i's platform.",1473
18511,"2014m5","When we look at the fund management businesses' profitability, we recognized that it should receive a notional fee on the proprietary capital that it is managing on behalf of 3i Group's shareholders.",1473
18511,"2014m5","These synthetic fees are set with reference to our third-party bond mandates.",1473
18511,"2014m5","For this year and last, they're set at 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5% on our capital invested in Private Equity and infrastructure, and 0.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5% on Debt Management capital.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've also allocated operating expenses between the fund management platform and to the proprietary capital investment business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The positive impact from cost savings, as Simon talked about earlier, flow through here, with the reduction from GBP 140 million last year to GBP 108 million this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So with stable combined fee income, the fund management platform became profitable for the first time at an absolute level.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And when we take our restructuring and amortization costs, underlying profit was GBP 33 million, and as a respectable margin of 26%.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our proprietary capital business, has also seen an improvement year-on-year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I've already talked about good realized profit and strong value growth.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The majority portfolio is invested outside the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's 51% denominated in euros, and 16% in dollars.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So revaluing this portfolio in a period where sterling has strengthened does result in significant differences.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're talking about a translation loss of GBP 113 million, against a GBP 52 million gain last year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And this is how that movement is made up.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And based on the balance sheet at the 3st of March, a further 1% movement in the euro or dollar, will change returns by GBP 13 million and GBP 6 million, respectively.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Proprietary capital business has the balance sheet funding costs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You can see here the very positive impact of our gross debt reduction, with interest payable, down 47% to GBP 54 million in the year, well ahead of our GBP 60 million target.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Most significant aspects of proprietary investments was the increase in momentum in Private Equity.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Although we remain highly selective about opportunities.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As Simon talked about, we made cash investment of GBP 276 million in Private Equity, including 3 new investments, Basic Fit, GIF and JMJ, and the furthe investments in Scandlines with Eurofund V.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our proprietary capital lets us support the growth of our Debt Management business through warehouse vehicles, which are used to build up credit portfolios in order to see CLO launches and to avoid cash drag on returns.",1473
18511,"2014m5","At the 31st of March, we had a total of GBP 21 million invested in our European and U.",1473
18511,"2014m5","warehouse vehicles, ahead of the next CLO launches in these regions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We also invest in the equity of a CLO when it is launched.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is particularly important, because new regulatory developments require fund managers to have the skin in the game.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our proprietary capital means that we can do that.",1473
18511,"2014m5","During the year, we invested GBP 40 million into the 4 new CLOs raised.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Core infrastructure investment is principally funded by 3i infrastructure plc, and we've have no other calls on the proprietary capital for that business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Bringing all this together on the group balance sheet, investment momentum has improved in the year but market conditions mean that it's a better time for realizations.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we finished the year with net cash divestment of GBP 340 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The portfolio value increased to GBP 3.",1473
18511,"2014m5","6 billion, because of the effect of the net divestment, was offset by strong value growth.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We used proceeds from realizations to reduce gross debt.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Gross debts reduced to GBP 857 million, and net debt to GBP 160 million, with gearing of only 5%.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we have clearly satisfied the criteria to operate our enhanced distribution policy.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we indicated at the half-year, that we expected to pay a dividend of 20p in total for this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Realizations have been good, investment levels having improved, but as Simon talked about, the environment for midmarket Private Equity investing remains very competitive.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Taking these factors into account, we have confirmed the 20p dividend today.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Subject to shareholder approval, we declared a final dividend of 13.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As for the year that we're now in, we expect to pay above our 8.",1473
18511,"2014m5","1p base level dividend again, but the level of additional dividend will be a bit lower in financial year 2014.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So to sum up.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our performance in financial year 2014 has been strong, and shows the benefit of our restructuring coming through.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It has been underpinned by excellent performance in the Private Equity business, achieving an annual cash operating profit, a significant milestone for the group, and an outperformance against all the strategic targets that we set out in June 2012.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The momentum in the business continues, and we are well-placed to build further value to shareholders in the next year of transition and delivery.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So thank you.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And Simon and I will now be happy to take questions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I think we -- the 15% cost is clearly the new policy.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I think as a company, we would, in general, like to work well within that figure, because I would expect as we reshape the portfolio, we'll come down to a natural number of say, 30 investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We'll have hopefully, in that 30, no bucket 4 investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We'll have very few bucket 3, so it will be bucket 1 or 2, so it will be a more balanced value across the 30 assets.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But w we have a truly special investment, like in Action, we need to be able to run that sort of winner, take a leap out of Warren Buffet's book, and that's what we do.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We want the flexibility to do that if we find such a thing.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And there are other examples of that round of Private Equity world, where people have run winners for a very long time.",1473
18511,"2014m5","one of Chris' favorites stocks, they ran -- how long did they own [indiscernible], was it 10 years, or something? Do you want to take that? I mean I would just add on Action, when you look at it, because it's been a subject of significant discussion within 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Clearly, the IPO on Pound land has had an impact, and there are quite strong signals at BNM and other hard discounts in the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5","is coming to the market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But if you just reference pound, and we put this thing on a 12.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5x EBITDA multiple on these run rate earnings, compared to something like pound [PH] land that's trading on 18x to 19x on a perspective EBITDA multiple.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So there's plenty of room there.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The difference between the 2, is that Action is growing strongly in 4 big economies, Germany, France, Holland and Belgium, it has maturity higher like-for-likes.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's opening over 100 new stores this year, and it's gotten very high returns on equity.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So this is quite, quite an interesting business in our portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Yes? [indiscernible] Thanks, Julia.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Daniel? Okay, I think, let's start.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Good morning, everyone.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Welcome to 3i's results for the year 31ST March, 2014.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Well, as you can see, the momentum in the business has continued and we've had an excellent 6 months since our interim presentation last November.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've made some very promising Private Equity investments, the portfolio is developing well, realizations and cash flow have been strong, and both infrastructure and Debt Management have achieved important milestones.",1473
18511,"2014m5","These results clearly show the very significant benefits from our restructuring and financial year '13, as well as from our new asset management initiatives.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I'd like to start by focusing on our strategic objectives on our progress over the last year and gross with some comments about our business model before handing over to Julia.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's been another good year to be a shareholder in 3i, with a total shareholder return of 30%, including a 20p dividend, which gives a 6% yield on the share price in the beginning of our financial year 2014.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've achieved the second year of 40%-plus returns on our Private Equity realizations, and we have returned to the new investment market with GBP 372 million in 3 new and 1 large follow-on investment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've again, materially outperformed our second year cost-saving targets of GBP 60 million, by coming in at GBP 70 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And as you can see, the operational linkages we have suffered from, are now a thing of the past, with cash income in the year exceeding our new reduced cost base by GBP 5 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You're familiar with our model, so I'd like to start by focusing on our strategic objectives and our progress over the year and those with some comments about our business model before handing over to Julia.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's important to note at this stage that we have made good progress in our 2  smaller businesses: Infrastructure and Debt Management, as well as Private Equity.",1473
18511,"2014m5","These results we've delivered reflect every aspect of 3i's value build.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is not just to jam tomorrow's story, this is jam today, as well as jam tomorrow.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The portfolios delivering growth in earnings in value, and has been another strong year of realizations.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Cash flow relative to costs has been strong, and we've made good progress in fund management profits.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've made some excellent new investments, as well as a strategic acquisition in the infrastructure sector, and we've significantly raised our share holder distributions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are now more than halfway through the plan I set out in June 2012, and we now have real momentum in the face of transition and delivery.",1473
18511,"2014m5","After our fundamental restructuring in financial year 2013, we had 6 strategic priorities for financial year 2014, and we've either exceeded our met every single one, as you can see here.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's been a great year for Private Equity, and I'd like to say well done to the 3i team.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've seen strong growth in our proprietary portfolio through both earnings and valuation multiples, and we've seen a good flow of realizations at excellent uplifts and decent said cash on cash multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Julia will give you a couple of examples in a minute.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Once again, we've not been selling any of our keeper assets but we have sold the mix from our buckets 2, 3 and 4.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Those disposals have given us a meaningful reduction in the number of smaller problem investments in our portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","New investment has picked up, but we've been very careful to be disciplined on price and careful to be consistent with our strategic focus.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've added 5 new executives in the last 6 months, bringing our total number of investors to 59, and we've a stable core parter team, balanced across our key geographies and they are focusing on our core sectors of industrial consumer and business services.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've seen very strong returns across our European and U.",1473
18511,"2014m5","businesses, and the 2011 onwards investments have performed particularly well.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'm delighted to see how the team has embraced the asset management initiatives, which we put in place during 2012.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are monitoring the portfolio closely, and we're focusing hard on those situations where performance is below our expectations.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Right at the start, I said that it has been another excellent year for realizations, and here's how they look.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've delivered proceeds of GBP 669 million at a 43% uplift to opening values.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The money multiple of 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","8x is very good, especially, when we've sold a decent number of our smaller or underperforming investments during the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now I'd like to talk briefly about portfolio segmentation, or what I call the buckets.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're seeing excellent earnings growth in our keepers bucket, which now accounts for over 40% of the PE portfolio value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Action is the standout investment here.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But we have a number of other promising investments, which have to prove the potential to drive cash on cash returns, significantly above 2x over the medium-term.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And they include a number of our most recent investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Of our 24 realizations, 6 were either partially realizations or from bucket 2, and 18 were from buckets 3 and 4.",1473
18511,"2014m5","That shows you the extent of the tidying up exercises here, and how we have now reduced the portfolio to 81 company from over 100.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I expect the value of our keepers bucket to continue to grow well over the next 12 months, and we will also see a further reduction in the number of overall investments in the portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And I'm very excited about the PE investments we've made this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We made a significant follow-on investment in Sandlines, which has already been already a strong investment for 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is our large keeper bucket asset, and we're anticipating a strong value growth over the medium-term Steve Ridgeway, the new Chairman and former CEO of Virgin Atlantic, works with the existing management team at Scandlines.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Basic Fit, JMJ and GIF, are all new investments, which are consistent with our strategic focus on local origination of international companies.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They maintain our price disciplined over this assets, buying all of them at attractive multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now looking around the room, I can see there's a number of you who are fitness fanatics.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Don't worry, Bill, I wasn't looking at you.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I want to tell you about my day with Rene Moose, the CEO of Basic Fit.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This was last September, and this was before we bought the business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And I think it shows how we find deals and the power of 3i's international franchise.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Basic Fit is the largest discount fitness operator in Europe.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We know the business for several years and have attracted since 2011.",1473
18511,"2014m5","To give you an idea of its scale, it had 64,000 new members in January this year alone.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Rene is a former professional tennis player.",1473
18511,"2014m5","He's highly competitive and he's a gifted businessman.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We first approached Rene, the founder and CEO of Basic Fit, in 2011, after our consumer team had identified discount as a winning theme in retail and the retail services sector.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Rene had 3 businesses at the time, a golf course business, an up market gym business, and Basic Fit.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We approached him at roughly the same time we approached and purchased Action.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But Rene wasn't interested in our approach.",1473
18511,"2014m5","He didn't accept that the discount format was his best business, and was unconvinced by arguments that the discount business of scale up, and make his fortune in.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But after reading about and seeing the success of Action, Rene contracted our Amsterdam team in early 2003 -- 2013, and after a meeting to discuss the success of Action and our current thoughts on Basic Fit fit.",1473
18511,"2014m5","When I met Rene in September and toward Basic Fit, I was impressed by his energy and detailed understanding of the Basic Fit business and the broader fitness market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","At the washup meeting with him at the end of the tour and the day, and before I supported the investment proposal, I asked him why he was dealing with 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I haven't talked to any other buyout firms, and I liked what I heard.",1473
18511,"2014m5","He said your PE team has educated me on the protection of Basic Fit on where I would succeed.",1473
18511,"2014m5","For too long, I've been dazzled by the upmarket gym business without really understanding the power of a large scale value-for-money discount franchise.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And your team is Dutch, which is important to me.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They've been investing in Dutch companies for decades.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They speak my language.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And they have a great track record in this market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I would rather work with your local Dutch team than deal with Brits or Americans who fly in and out of ship hold on an irregular basis.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This was an interesting comment given 5 minutes earlier, I'd ask him to ask his PA to print my boarding card.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But anyway, as you can say, Rene can be very direct, and is a classic entrepreneur.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now that's what I call competitive advantage.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are on the ground and we have the skills to identify companies with strong potential, and we can provide financial and operational support.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It was the same for Action, and it gives us the opportunity to invest in these strong businesses away from the froth of hotly contested auctions in London.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Infrastructure has continued to make good contribution to the group's annual cash income, and the European portfolio has performed well.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The new leadership team has settled in quickly and has agreed with 3iN to further extend the advisory agreement.",1473
18511,"2014m5","India had a challenging time again, and we saw further pullback in the valuations, although we did see a more stable second half.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've also broadened our platform through the acquisition of a PPP-focused team form Barclays.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They have a strong pipeline of deals, and we are now focusing on the next fundraising.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We now have 25 investors in London and Paris, and 6 investors in Mumbai.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Debt Management has delivered another productive year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They've raised 4 new CLOs in the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5","and in the newly-opened European market, and they manage GBP 6.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5 billion of AUM.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And they're now in the top 10 global CLO managers.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You'll be pleased to hear that we significantly overreached on cost savings for our second year in a row.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our cost metrics are now very much in line with the rest of the industry, including the 2 acquisitions of Fraser, Sullivan and BIFM, the group's now got operating cost of about GBP 129 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our cash income actually exceeded operating cost in financial year 2014, and that something the group has not achieved for a very long time, that outcome was a direct result of our cost-reduction program.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is a tight metric for 3i because of our preponderance of proprietary capital, so I'm particularly pleased by this step this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've also significantly cut our interest bill by repaying debt, it's now down to GBP 54 million from GBP 101 million in our last financial year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we've now fully implemented our new compensation arrangements, and they've closely aligned senior staff to our key strategic objectives.",1473
18511,"2014m5","3i shares now make up a significant Element of variable compensation, and that gives us further alignment with the shareholders.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now I'd like to move to financial year '15, the second year of our transition and delivery phase.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Here are our strategic priorities for the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","h They're clear, but fundamentally, they remain focused on thoughtful and well executed asset management, careful new investments and tight cost control.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And if we achieve that, we will deliver another year of marked improvement in capital efficiency and allocation, as we did this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This shift you can see in capital allocations is increasing cash for new investments and the shareholder distributions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now let me turn to the group's business model.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have a hybrid model, we have a large portfolio of proprietary investments, as well as acting as a fund manager for third-party capital.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The weight of our proprietary capital in midmarket private equity is the fundamental driver of our results, and gives us a competitive advantage in closing and investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're an active owner of investments, as well as being manager of third-party funds.",1473
18511,"2014m5","In our Private Equity and infrastructure vehicles, we are the single largest investor.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We back our analysis and judgment with 3i cash, alongside the cash of our external LPs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The revenues and profits from our fund management activities contribute  to the cost of running our investment platforms, and they create another source of value for 3i shareholders, especially as our fund management franchise grows.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We want you to be able to track our progress in proprietary capital investing and as a fund manager.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We think this greater transparency will be helpful in judging just how well we're doing.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Going forward, we'll be using this core set of KPIs, so that you can track our progress and performance at group level in our returns on proprietary capital and from our fund management activities.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'd like to close by saying we had a very good year where we have a see the clear benefits of our restructuring and from our new asset management initiatives in Private Equity.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've also been clearing up our Private Equity portfolio, and we've put out the fires.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've good earnings momentum across the portfolio and cash flow is strong, particularly in our larger investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have some very special investments in our keeper bucket of assets.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And as I said, a minute ago, they now account for over 40% of portfolio value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We think they are capable of very strong growth over the medium-term.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are of course, hostage to broader economic and political trends.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But subject to those broader trends, I would expect to see another strong year for 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As the portfolio moves forward, we take advantage of bouyant realization markets, and we remain energetic but selective when finding new investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So on that note, I'd like to pass over to Julia to give you more details and color on the results.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Just a couple of questions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The first one is, the example you gave about, I just wanted to flip it off its head, because obviously, in the last couple of years, you've done a lot of restructuring particularly in sort of Southern Europe.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So are there any sort of investments you're actually missing out on, because of your footprints are not kind of not big enough anymore? And then my second question, would just be around sort of Action again -- you mentioned youve done a refinancing, and correct me, if I'm wrong, a large portion of that refinancing comes back to 3i' as a dividend, so I'm just trying to think, when is the next refinancing due, and should we be expecting kind of another kind of big dividend? Okay.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Let me take the first 2, and then Julia can deal with the Action question.",1473
18511,"2014m5","On realizations, I think it's -- I would probably choose to modify my view a little.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Looking at our pipeline at the moment, and this is always subject to what might happen out there.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I think we'll be at a similar level to the year just finished.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So it's a bit stronger in terms of the realization pipeline I would suggest.",1473
18511,"2014m5","On pricing and the environment, in general, I think we're at a -- we are at a very interesting place.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are clearly, benefiting from buoyant conditions in the realization program.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we are getting very good prices, sometimes on even quite mediocre investments that we're selling.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The flipside of that is the competitive and high-priced nature of the investment environment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we have been using and focusing on our platform very hard to find stuff away from these very busy auctions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But that is clearly harder to do than just asking for book on everything that's being sold.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And if you look back over statistics for Private Equity, and as I've said before, 3i has its own library on this, given how long it's been around.",1473
18511,"2014m5","While we all like to feel we're geniuses in Private Equity, Vintage is the biggest determinant of returns.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And therefore, you need to moderate your excitement and compulsion to invest when banks are banging on your door with large debt packages and other things, because it's generally a pretty good sign that this might not be one of the finer vintages for investing.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that in reality, accounts for an awful lot of returns, both going up and going down in the Private Equity sector.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I think the smart people who are really smart, will be quite careful about investing in this environment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And I'm pretty glad we don't have a fun with lots of money burning a hole in our pocket, because we might feel under more pressure to buy stuff than we actually do.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we'll continue to make investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We'll continue to use our platform, but we are going to be very careful about the end prices, because the end prices would be the biggest determinants of the returns we're making in these investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Do you want to pick that 1 up? Okay.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So would it be fair to say, it's largely on price that you're not investing more? So I would say that the increase in the average multiple in the year, clearly, the Action multiple has an impact, and we've given you the numbers, excluding the Action impact.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So that's a 9.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We talked at the Q3 trading statement that we would cap multiples, taking into account a number of factors -- we thought the market was moving up.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've got good performance in a number of our assets and so we had to tweak some multiples up as we go through.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I mean to answer your specific question about new investments, no, the investments that we've done, have been lower than those sort of averages that we've just been talking about.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So it's then of the impact.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's more market driven and Action driven.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And then on the CLO equity performance, yes, we've seen some good returns coming out of that.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have a relatively small modest amount of capital in the business, but it can generate good, double digit returns for us.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Do you want to do with the actual one, first? Yes.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I think it's very likely there will be an Action refinancing this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I think on -- are we missing out, because we're no longer proactively investing in say, Southern Europe, we don't feel we are.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We still you there's a lot of issues in that market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And in the sort of sectors that we're looking in, we think there are better opportunities where we have the core teams at the moment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we don't think we're losing out materially.",1473
18511,"2014m5","From Numis.",1473
18511,"2014m5","With the disposal of some of the noncore investments and the focused on the keeper assets, what sort of level of portfolio concentration are you happy with going forward, how big do we see the largest investments? It's Ian from Oriel Securities.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I've got a couple.",1473
18511,"2014m5","First is obviously, quite a big increase in the multiples used on the valuation over the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Did the inclusion of new investments of presumably relatively high multiples, have much of an impact on this number? The second one, is the CLO portfolios, I was wondering if you can just talk about the performance of that, there seem to be a number of gains coming through there? Thank you.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Good morning.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Daniel here from Barclays.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Simon, a question for you first, and then one for Julia.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You mentioned a couple of times the sort of strong external environment, what you achieved in full year '14, before then, accelerating again in 2016, 2017.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Have your thoughts changed from that kind of outlook because of what you're seeing around the external environment? And in the outlook, you kind of the pricing for new investments remains quite difficult.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You're indicating you've done 4 deals in sort of recent months.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We could see a sort of a slower, cautious approach there on the investment side? And then a question for Julia on what exactly you done on Action, you looked -- so GBP 500 million valuation of Action of March and September, now I think the equivalent figure was GBP 300 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The split of that, from what you said around the sensitivity, it strikes me -- about 60% of that is the multiple uplift and about 40% is earnings growth.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Am I right, ballpark in that estimation? Thank you.",1473
18511,"2014m5","15, their best investment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","CBC, they're going to be holding Formula 1 for a long time.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I mean, there are plenty of examples of running winners in this industry if they produce a lot of cash and produce a lot of value, and we will be no different.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Any more before we wind up? Okay, well, thanks for coming.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Happy to mingle afterwards.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So there was a refinancing in Action in the first half.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And actually, because of the way that was structured, that came back as proceeds to us.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we received GBP 59 million of proceeds in the first half.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As I said, it's got very good free cash flow.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And post that refinancing, net debt is now down to 3.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we will obviously continue to look at ways of making sure that that's the most efficient, and we could be looking at further refinancings in the future.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Daniel Garrod, Barclays.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Simon, a question for you first, and then one for Julia.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You mentioned a couple of times the sort of strong external environment, what you achieved in full year '14, before then accelerating again in 2016, 2017.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Have your thoughts changed from that kind of outlook because of what you're seeing around the external environment? And in the outlook, you kind of read the pricing for new investments remains quite difficult.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You're indicating there you've done 4 deals in sort of recent months, that we could see a sort of slow and cautious approach there on the investment side.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And then a question for Julia on what exactly you've done on Action.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It looked -- so GBP 500 million valuation of Action at March.",1473
18511,"2014m5","At September, I think that equivalent figure was GBP 300 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The split of that, it -- from what you've said around the sensitivity, it strikes me about 60% of that is the multiple uplift, and about 40% is earnings growth.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Am I right, ballpark, in that estimation? The multiples one.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I would say that the increase in the average multiple in the year, clearly, the Action multiple has an impact, and we've given you the numbers, excluding the Action impact.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So that's a 9.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We talked at the Q3 trading statement that we would cap multiples, taking into account a number of factors.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We thought the market was moving up.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've got good performance in a number of our assets, and so we have tweaked some multiples up as we go through.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I mean, to answer your specific question about new investments, no, the investments that we've been -- we've done have been lower than those sort of averages that we've just been talking about, so it's not -- they're not cause of the impact.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's more market driven and Action driven.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And then on the CLO equity performance, yes, we've seen some good returns coming out of that.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have a relatively modest amount of capital in the business, but it can generate good, double-digit returns for us.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I mean, I would just add on Action, when you look at it, because it's been a subject of significant discussion within 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Clearly, the IPO of Poundland has had an impact, and there are quite strong signals that B&M, another hard discounter in the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5",", is coming to the market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But if you just reference Poundland, we've put this thing on a 12.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5x EBITDA multiple on these run rate earnings compared to something like Poundland that's trading on 18x to 19x on a prospective EBITDA multiple.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So there's plenty of room there.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The difference between the 2 is that Action is growing strongly in 4 big economies: Germany, France, Holland and Belgium.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It has materially higher like-for-likes.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's opening over 100 new stores this year, and it's gotten very high returns on equity.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So this is quite, quite an interesting business in our portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Iain Scouller.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Do you want to take this? Okay.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So would it be fair to say it's largely on price, that you're not investing more? Do you want to deal with the Action one first? It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Just a couple of questions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The first one is the example you gave about investment [ph], I just wanted to kind of flip it on its head because, obviously, in the last couple years, you've done quite a lot of restructuring, particularly in sort of the Southern Europe.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So are there any sort of investments you're actually missing out on because your footprint's kind of not big enough anymore? And then my second question would just be around sort of Action again.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You've mentioned you've just done a refinancing, and correct me if I'm wrong, a large portion of that refinancing comes back to 3i as a dividend.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I'm just trying to think, when is the next refinancing due and should we be expecting another kind of big dividend? It's very much on price.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have the best pipeline of potential new investments that I've seen since I joined 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we're getting a good look at quite a lot of stuff, but we're discarding quite a lot because of the relationship with price and expectation.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Any more? One at the front.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I've got a couple.",1473
18511,"2014m5","First, there's obviously quite a big increase in the multiples used on the valuation over the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Did the inclusion of new investments of presumably relatively higher multiples have much of an impact on this number? And the second one is the CLO portfolios.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about the performance of that.",1473
18511,"2014m5","There seemed to be a number of gains coming through there.",1473
18511,"2014m5","To give you a rough guidance, and I'll give it to you, from March to March, the value at March was GBP 280 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And as you correctly say, the value at the end of this financial year was GBP 501 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","There are -- the really important dynamic in Action is the strong earnings growth that we see both in very good like-for-likes but also the store rollout program that they've got.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And as I've talked about, we adjust for that in the earnings of these valuations by adding a sort of pro forma on stores being opened, and that's the run rate basis that we're using.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And then as I've said, we've also taken decision to step up the multiple to recognize that growth rate.",1473
18511,"2014m5","If you look at the movement from March to March, there is more benefit coming from the earnings growth than the multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's a shape beyond the 50% comes from earnings, it's probably about 55%, 45%, something like that.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I think we -- the 15% cost is clearly the new policy.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I think, as a company, we would, in general, like to work well within that figure because I would expect, as we reshape the portfolio, we'll come down to a natural number of, say, 30 investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We'll have, hopefully, in that 30 no bucket 4 investments, we'll have very few bucket 3, so it'll be bucket 1 or 2.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So it will be a more balanced value across the 30 assets.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But when we have a truly special investment, like an Action, we need to be able to run that sort of winner, take a leaf out of Warren Buffett's book, and that's what we'd do, and we want the flexibility to do that if we find such a thing.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And there are other examples of that round of Private Equity world, where people have run winners for a very long time.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I know like for one of Chris's [ph] favorites stocks, they ran -- how long did they handle [ph] Flex4 [ph], was it 10 years or something? Okay, I think, let's start.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Good morning, everyone.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Welcome to 3i's results for the year to 31st March, 2014.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Well, as you can see, the momentum in the business has continued, and we've had an excellent 6 months since our interim presentation last November.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've made some very promising Private Equity investments, the portfolio is developing well, realizations and cash flow have been strong, and both Infrastructure and Debt Management have achieved important milestones.",1473
18511,"2014m5","These results clearly show the very significant benefits from our restructuring in financial year '13, as well as from our new asset management initiatives.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I'd like to start by focusing on our strategic objectives and our progress over the last year and close with some comments about our business model before handing over to Julia.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's been another good year to be a shareholder in 3i, with a total shareholder return of 30%, including a 20p dividend, which gives a 6% yield on the share price at the beginning of our financial year 2014.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've achieved the second year of 40%-plus returns on our Private Equity realizations.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we have returned to the new investment market with GBP 372 million in 3 new and 1 large follow-on investment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've again materially outperformed our second year cost-saving targets of GBP 60 million by coming in at GBP 70 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And as you can see, the operational leakages we have suffered from are now a thing of the past, with cash income in the year exceeding our new reduced cost base by GBP 5 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You're familiar with our model, so I'd like to start by focusing on our strategic objectives and our progress over the year and close with some comments about our business model before handing over to Julia.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's important to note at this stage that we have made good progress in our 2 smaller businesses: Infrastructure and Debt Management, as well as Private Equity.",1473
18511,"2014m5","These results we've delivered reflect every aspect of 3i's value build.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is not just to jam tomorrow's story, this is jam today, as well as jam tomorrow.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The portfolio is delivering growth in earnings and value and has been another strong year of realizations.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Cash flow relative to costs has been strong, and we've made good progress in Fund Management profits.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've made some excellent new investments, as well as a strategic acquisition in the infrastructure sector.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we've significantly raised our shareholder distributions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are now more than halfway through the plan I set out in June 2012.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we now have real momentum in the face of transition and delivery after our fundamental restructuring in financial year 2013.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We had 6 strategic priorities for financial year 2014, and we've either exceeded or met every single one, as you can see here.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's been a great year for Private Equity, and I'd like to say well done to the 3i PE team.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've seen strong growth in our proprietary portfolio through both earnings and valuation multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we've seen a good flow of realizations at excellent uplifts and decent cash on cash multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Julia will give you a couple of examples in a minute.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Once again, we've not been selling any of our keeper assets, but we have sold the mix from our buckets 2, 3 and 4.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Those disposals have given us a meaningful reduction in the number of smaller problem investments in our portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","New investment has picked up, but we've been very careful to be disciplined on price and careful to be consistent with our strategic focus.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've added 5 new executives in the last 6 months, bringing our total number of investors to 59.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we have a stable core partner team balanced across our key geographies, and they are focusing on our core sectors of industrial consumer and business services.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've seen very strong returns across our European and U.",1473
18511,"2014m5","businesses, and the 2011 onwards investments have performed particularly well.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'm delighted to see how the team has embraced the asset management initiatives, which we put in place during 2012.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are monitoring the portfolio closely, and we're focusing hard on those situations where performance is below our expectations.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Right at the start, I said that it has been another excellent year for realizations, and here's how they look.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've delivered proceeds of GBP 669 million at a 43% uplift to opening values.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The money multiple is 1 -- of 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","8x is very good, especially when we've sold a decent number of our smaller or underperforming investments during the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now I'd like to talk briefly about portfolio segmentation or what I call the buckets.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're seeing excellent earnings growth in our keepers bucket, which now accounts for over 40% of the PE portfolio value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Action is the standout investment here.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But we have a number of other promising investments, which have the potential to drive cash on cash returns significantly above 2x over the medium term.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And they include a number of our most recent investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Of our 24 realizations, 6 were either partial realizations or from bucket 2, and 18 were from buckets 3 and 4.",1473
18511,"2014m5","That shows you the extent of the tidying-up exercises here and how we have now reduced the portfolio to 81 companies from over 100.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I expect the value of our keepers bucket to continue to grow well over the next 12 months.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we will also see a further reduction in the number of overall investments in the portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And I'm very excited about the PE investments we've made this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We made a significant follow-on investment in Scandlines, which has already been a strong investment for 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is a large keeper bucket asset, and we're anticipating a strong value growth over the medium term, as Steve Ridgway, the new Chairman and former CEO of Virgin Atlantic, works with the existing management team of Scandlines.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Basic-Fit, JMJ and GIF are all new investments, which are consistent with our strategic focus on local origination of international companies.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We maintained our price discipline on these assets, buying all of them at attractive multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now looking around the room, I can see there's a number of you who are fitness fanatics.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Don't worry, Bill, I wasn't looking at you.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I want to tell you about my day with Rene Moos, the CEO of Basic-Fit.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This was last September, and this was before we bought the business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And I think it shows how we find deals and the power of 3i's international franchise.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Basic-Fit is the largest discount fitness operator in Europe.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've known the business for several years and have tracked it since 2011.",1473
18511,"2014m5","To give you an idea of its scale, it had 64,000 new members in January this year alone.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Rene is a former professional tennis player.",1473
18511,"2014m5","He's highly competitive, and he's a gifted businessman.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We first approached Rene, the Founder and CEO of Basic-Fit, in 2011, after our consumer team had identified discount as the winning theme in retail and the retail services sector.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Rene had 3 businesses at the time: a golf course business, an upmarket gym business and Basic-Fit.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We approached him at roughly the same time we approached and purchased Action.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But Rene wasn't interested in our approach.",1473
18511,"2014m5","He didn't accept that the discount format was his best business and was unconvinced by our arguments that discount was a business to scale up and make his fortune in.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But after reading about and seeing the success of Action, Rene contacted our Amsterdam team in early 2003 -- 2013 and asked for a meeting to discuss the success of Action and our current thoughts on Basic-Fit.",1473
18511,"2014m5","When I met Rene in September toward [ph] Basic-Fit, I was impressed by his energy and detailed understanding of the Basic-Fit business and the broader fitness market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","At the washup meeting with him at the end of it all and the day and before I supported the investment proposal, I asked him why he was dealing with 3i and haven't talked to any other buyout firms, and I liked what I heard.",1473
18511,"2014m5","He said, ""Your PE team has educated me on the potential of Basic-Fit, on where I would succeed.",1473
18511,"2014m5","For too long, I've been dazzled by the upmarket gym business without really understanding the power of a large-scale, value-for-money discount franchise.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And your team is Dutch, which is important to me.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They've been investing in Dutch companies for decades, they speak my language, and they have a great track record in this market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I would rather work with your local Dutch team than deal with Brits or Americans, who fly in and out of ship hold on an irregular basis.",1473
18511,"2014m5",""" This was an interesting comment, given 5 minutes earlier, I'd ask him to ask his PA to print my boarding card.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But anyway, as you can say, Rene can be very direct and is a classic entrepreneur.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now that's what I'd call competitive advantage.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are on the ground, and we have the skills to identify companies with strong potential, and we can provide financial and operational support.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It was the same for Action, and it gives us the opportunity to invest in these strong businesses away from the froth of hotly contested auctions in London.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Infrastructure has continued to make good contribution to the group's annual cash income.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And the European portfolio has performed well.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The new leadership team has settled in quickly and has agreed with 3iN to further extend the advisory agreement.",1473
18511,"2014m5","India had a challenging time again, and we saw a further pullback in the valuations, although we did see a more stable second half.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've also broadened our platform through the acquisition of a PPP-focused team from Barclays.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They have a strong pipeline of deals, and we are now focusing on the next fundraising.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We now have 25 investors in London and Paris and 6 investors in Mumbai.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Debt Management has delivered another productive year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They've raised 4 new CLOs in the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5","and in the newly opened European market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And they manage GBP 6.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5 billion of AUM.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And they're now in the top 10 global CLO managers.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You'll be pleased to hear that we significantly overreached on cost savings for our second year in a row.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our cost metrics are now very much in line with the rest of the industry.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Including the 2 acquisitions, Fraser Sullivan and BIFM, the group's now got operating costs of about GBP 129 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our cash income actually exceeded operating costs in financial year 2014, and that's something the group has not achieved for a very long time.",1473
18511,"2014m5","That outcome was a direct result of our cost-reduction program.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is a tight metric for 3i because of our preponderance of Proprietary Capital, so I'm particularly pleased by this step this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've also significantly cut our interest bill.",1473
18511,"2014m5","By repaying debt, it's now down to GBP 54 million from GBP 101 million in our last financial year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we've now fully implemented our new compensation arrangements, and they've closely aligned senior staff to our key strategic objectives.",1473
18511,"2014m5","3i shares now make up a significant element of variable compensation, and that gives us further alignment with the shareholders.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now I'd like to move to financial year '15, the second year of our transition and delivery phase.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Here are our strategic priorities for the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They're clear, but fundamentally, they remain focused on thoughtful and well-executed asset management, careful new investments and tight cost control.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And if we achieve that, we will deliver another year of marked improvement in capital efficiency and allocation, as we did this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This shift you can see in capital allocations is increasing cash for new investments and shareholder distributions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now let me turn to the group's business model.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have a hybrid model.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have a large portfolio of proprietary investments, as well as acting as a fund manager for third-party capital.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The weight of our Proprietary Capital in mid-market Private Equity is the fundamental driver of our results and gives us the competitive advantage in closing new investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're an active owner of investments, as well as being manager of third-party funds.",1473
18511,"2014m5","In our Private Equity and Infrastructure vehicles, we are the single largest investor.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We back our analysis and judgment with 3i cash, alongside the cash of our external LPs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The revenues and profits from our Fund Management activities contribute to the cost of running our investment platforms, and they create another source of value for 3i shareholders, especially as our Fund Management franchise grows.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We want you to be able to track our progress in Proprietary Capital investing and as a fund manager.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We think this greater transparency will be helpful in judging just how well we're doing.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Going forward, we'll be using this core set of KPIs so that you can track our progress and performance at group level in our returns on Proprietary Capital and from our Fund Management activities.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'd like to close by saying we've had a very good year, where we have seen the clear benefits from our restructuring and from our new asset management initiatives in Private Equity.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've also been clearing up our Private Equity portfolio, and we've put out the fires.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have good earnings momentum across the portfolio, and cash flow is strong, particularly in our larger investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have some very special investments in our keeper bucket of assets, and as I said a minute ago, they now account for over 40% of portfolio value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We think they are capable of very strong growth over the medium term.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are, of course, hostage to broader economic and political trends.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But subject to those broader trends, I would expect to see another strong year for 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As the portfolio moves forward, we take advantage of bouyant realization markets, and we remain energetic but selective when finding new investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So on that note, I'd like to pass over to Julia to give you more detailed color on the results.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Yes, I think it's very likely there'll be an Action refinancing this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I think on are we missing out because we're no longer proactively investing in, say, Southern Europe, we don't feel we are.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We still feel there's a lot of issues in that market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And in the sort of sectors that we're looking in, we think there are better opportunities where we have the core teams at the moment, so we don't think we're losing out materially.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Thanks, Julia.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Daniel? Thanks, Simon, and good morning, everybody.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This has been a year of strong delivery, and we've generated real momentum, and you can see the evidence in the results that Simon and I are talking about today.",1473
18511,"2014m5","One point I want to note just at the start, this year, we've adopted a new accounting consolidation standard.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It has no effect on the results, but it changes the components of our returns, balance sheet and cash flow, and that means that the audited financial statutory statements actually look very different.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And it's a bit hard to see the detailed picture, so we decided that it would be more helpful to present the numbers today on the basis that's consistent with previous periods.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We believe that this makes our results easier to understand, and we're calling this our investment basis.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that's what we used in our press release this morning as well.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'm not going to go through the change in detail here today.",1473
18511,"2014m5","There's an explanation and reconciliation in the press release and some explanatory slides in the back of your packs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Of course, I'm happy to take any questions at the end of the presentation, but enough of the technicalities.",1473
18511,"2014m5","3% total return we have delivered is a great result and all the more so because the numbers are after the headwind of sterling's strength, which I'll come onto in a minute.",1473
18511,"2014m5","At a group level, we have achieved an annual cash operating profit of GBP 5 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is an important milestone.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It demonstrates that our financial model is far more sustainable and that we can make capital allocation decisions without leakage from our cost base.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As you know and as Simon confirmed a minute ago, we've made great progress in reducing our costs, but staying focused on the cash operating profit means we won't lose sight of this operational efficiency.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But as well as efficiency, we've built momentum for growth during the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have put our Proprietary Capital to work, making cash investment of GBP 337 million in Private Equity and Debt Management.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we've continued to strengthen the balance sheet, with the realizations of GBP 677 million of good money multiples and a further reduction in gross debt to GBP 857 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're now giving more information about the profitability of our Fund Management platform, and this is for the first time.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'm going to take you through that in more detail later, but note here that fee income is stable, and we've improved both profitability and margin.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We closed the period with NAV per share of 348p.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And you can see here how that has progressed since December and over the course of the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Very strong performance from our Private Equity portfolio in realizations and portfolio value growth, significant reductions in our cost base and interest bill mean that the dilution of those returns is dramatically lower.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But there is a reduction from the increase in our carry provision because of the strong portfolio performance and in FX translation loss as sterling has strengthened.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Finally, we paid 1/3 of our proposed 20p dividend in January, and together with last year's final dividend, that gives you the 12.",1473
18511,"2014m5","1p that you can see here.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So first, let's look at the performance of our Private Equity business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The GBP 647 million gross investment return that we've generated is 24% over opening portfolio valuation of GBP 2.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And within that, the return from the core Northern European and North American portfolio was excellent at 30%, and that now accounts for 90% of the total portfolio value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Simon talked about some of the significant realizations that have driven the realized profits of GBP 201 million and the uplift of 43% over opening value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Just to note, as you may have already seen in the press release, we're now reporting gross investment return after foreign exchange movements on the portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So the GBP 647 million that you can see here is net of the translation loss of GBP 100 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So what are the drivers of the unrealized value growth? The weighted average 12 months earnings growth for those companies that we value using earnings was 19%, driven particularly by the assets in our keepers bucket, such as Action and Element.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We talked a lot around the Q3 IMS about our cautioned in following the market up when we set our valuation multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is still the case, but we will re-rate companies if we think that their performance and our expectations about exit potential merit it.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'm going to talk separately about how we valued Action in a minute because it has a big affect on the numbers that you can see here.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Before I do, please also note the low level of companies that are being valued using forecast earnings.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We do that when earnings are lower than the last 12 months to anticipate a downturn in performance, so a low number here, just 3% by value, is a good metric.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Net debt in the portfolio stayed low at an average of 3.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And 79% of that debt is now due up to 2016, as we've taken opportunities to refinance.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So there's been quite a lot of focus on our investment in Action.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It is clearly a material part of the book, so I'm going to give you some more specific detail about how we valued it.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've been using the run rate adjusted earning since this time last year to reflect the significant growth in the business from store openings.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The success of the management team in that store rollout and strong like-for-likes now gives us the confidence to reset the comparable multiples and to include high-growth companies which we've previously excluded.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And of course, the recent IPO of Poundland has given us a new data point.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we've increased the post-discount multiple from 10x to 12.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Action generates very good free cash flow.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And after the refinancing that we did last summer, its net debt is only 3.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Having made these changes, we now hold Action in our books at a value of GBP 501 million, which is 14.",1473
18511,"2014m5","1% of our portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","All other things being equal, at the 31st of March, an increase in the multiple from 12.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5x would increase our book value by GBP 50 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And by the way, this is one of the reasons why we're putting a resolution at the AGM to amend our investment policy.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Since our keeper assets demonstrate strong growth, we have a so-called nice problem to have, that single asset could account for more than 15% of portfolio value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that's a limit in our current investment policy.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now we don't think it makes sense for us to have to reduce an investment if we think there is better shareholder value to be had by keeping the investment for longer.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we're proposing to change the limit to apply it to investment costs rather than value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Coming back to the valuations in total, you can see here how the earnings growth and stable net debt in the portfolio as a whole means strong growth of GBP 182 million from performance.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The single biggest driver of the GBP 216 million increase in value from multiples is that decision to increase the Action multiple.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Valuation of Scandlines is included in the DCF line.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And since the further investments and appointment to the new Chairman, we're positive about the outlook for this business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The combined value of the old and new money has increased by GBP 21 million since that acquisition.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And the Equity [ph] portfolio, particularly Quintiles and GAIN Capital in the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5",", have performed very well in the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","With this strong performance overall, the top 20 Private Equity assets now account for 76% of the total Private Equity portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Here they are.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And you can see there's only a few exceptions, where our view is not positive on performance.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that is generally true in the remainder of the portfolio, as we've had another year with no provisions or material write-downs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","A consequence of this strong performance is that the provision that we make for carry payable has stepped up materially in the last quarter.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we pay carry on our Proprietary Capital investment to the investment teams at rates of between 10% and 15% in schemes set every 2 years.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Every quarter, we test each scheme to see whether it would've hit its performance hurdle if we'd sold all the assets at the balance sheet value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And if it has, they may accrue carry as if the asset is being sold, but we discount it to reflect that the actual payment date may be many years into the future.",1473
18511,"2014m5","When a scheme hits the hurdle for the first time, there's also a catch-up effect.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The 2010 to 2012 assets have performed particularly strongly.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This scheme includes Action.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And it's hit its hurdle for the first time this year on an accruals basis.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Rate on the scheme is just below 15%, and the provision for this scheme makes up the biggest part of the charge.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We received carry on third-party capital over the life of the relevant funds, some of which is then shared with the investment teams.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The performance of Eurofund V has improved dramatically, with the current fund multiple increasing to 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","13x at the 31st of March.",1473
18511,"2014m5","However, that's not a strong enough recovery to let it start accruing for carry receivable on this fund.",1473
18511,"2014m5","In fact, the drag from the 2007 to 2009 investments in this fund means we haven't recognized its carry receivable yet.",1473
18511,"2014m5","In cash terms, carry paid and carry received on cash realizations in schemes actually through their hurdles was much lower at GBP 25 million and GBP 5 million, respectively.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Let me now turn to Infrastructure, where it's been comparatively quieter year, although, as you have seen from 3i Infrastructure plc's results last week, there have been some good developments, with building our PPP capability and progress on the renewal of our advisory agreement with 3iN.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our 34% shareholding in 3iN delivers good dividend income.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We received GBP 21 million this year, a very important underpin to our cash profit metric.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The core European portfolio continues to perform well, but the performance of the Indian portfolio has been disappointing.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The value of our direct holding in these investments fell by 25%.",1473
18511,"2014m5","That includes the significant rupee and dollar depreciation in the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The PPP platform already covers its costs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And further fundraising by that team will also make a positive contribution to the cash profit metric and the group's Fund Management profitability.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our Debt Management business has the biggest contributor to that Fund Management profitability.",1473
18511,"2014m5","During the year, it closed 2 new CLOs in Europe and 2 in the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5",", and that added GBP 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","2 million -- GBP 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","2 billion assets under management and offset the run-off of the older funds.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We finished the year with assets under management of GBP 6.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Fee income was stable at GBP 32 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But as I said at the half year, the catch-up fees on older funds contributed GBP 6 million last year, and they no longer feature.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Excluding these catch-up fees, fee income grew by GBP 7 million, so an overall improvement in the quality of earnings.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Bringing together Fund Management contributions from all our businesses, you can see here the profitability of 3i's platform.",1473
18511,"2014m5","When we look at the Fund Management business's profitability, we recognize that it should receive a notional fee on the Proprietary Capital that it's managing on behalf of 3i Group's shareholders.",1473
18511,"2014m5","These synthetic fees are set with reference to our third-party bond mandates.",1473
18511,"2014m5","For this year and last, they're set at 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5% on our capital invested in Private Equity and Infrastructure and 0.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5% on Debt Management capital.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've also allocated operating expenses between the Fund Management platform and to the Proprietary Capital investment business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The positive impact from cost savings, as Simon talked about earlier, flow through here, with the reduction from GBP 140 million last year to GBP 108 million this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So with stable combined fee income, the Fund Management platform became profitable for the first time at an absolute level.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And when we take out restructuring and amortization costs, underlying profit was GBP 33 million, and that's a respectable margin of 26%.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our Proprietary Capital business has also seen an improvement year-on-year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I've already talked about good realized profit and strong value growth.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The majority of
[Audio Gap] 
portfolio is invested outside the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5",", with 51% denominated in euros and 16% in dollars.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So revaluing this portfolio in a period where sterling has strengthened does result in significant differences.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're talking about a translation loss of GBP 113 million against a GBP 52 million gain last year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is how that movement is made up.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And based on the balance sheet at the 3st of March, a further 1% movement in the euro or dollar would change returns by GBP 13 million and GBP 6 million, respectively.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Proprietary Capital business has the balance sheet funding costs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You can see here the very positive impact of our gross debt reduction, with interest payable down 47% to GBP 54 million in the year, well ahead of our GBP 60 million target.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The most significant aspect of Proprietary Capital investments was the increase in momentum in Private Equity, although we remain highly selective about opportunities.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As Simon talked about, we made cash investment of GBP 276 million in Private Equity, including 3 new investments: Basic-Fit, GIF and JMJ, and the further investment in Scandlines with Eurofund V.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our Proprietary Capital lets us support the growth of our Debt Management business through warehouse vehicles, which are used to build up credit portfolios in order to cede CLO launches and to avoid cash drag on returns.",1473
18511,"2014m5","At the 31st of March, we had a total of GBP 21 million invested in our European and U.",1473
18511,"2014m5","warehouse vehicles, ahead of the next CLO launches in these regions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We also invest in the equity of a CLO when it is launched.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is particularly important because new regulatory developments require fund managers to have skin in the game.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our Proprietary Capital means that we can do that.",1473
18511,"2014m5","During the year, we invested GBP 40 million into the 4 new CLOs raised.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Core Infrastructure investment is principally funded by 3i Infrastructure plc, and we've had no other calls on the Proprietary Capital for that business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Bringing all this together on the group balance sheet, investment momentum has improved in the year, but market conditions mean that it's a better time for realizations.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we finished the year with net cash divestment of GBP 340 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The portfolio value increased to GBP 3.",1473
18511,"2014m5","6 billion because of the effect of the net divestment was offset by strong value growth.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We used proceeds from realizations to reduce gross debt.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Gross debt reduced to GBP 857 million, and net debt to GBP 160 million, with gearing that's only 5%.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we have clearly satisfied the criteria to operate our enhanced distribution policy.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we indicated at the half year that we expected to pay a dividend of 20p in total for this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Realizations have been good.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Investment levels have improved.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But as Simon talked about, the environment for mid-market Private Equity investing remains very competitive.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Taking these factors into account, we have confirmed the 20p dividend today.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Subject to shareholder approval, we declared a final dividend of 13.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As for the year that we're now in, we expect to pay above our 8.",1473
18511,"2014m5","1p base level dividend again, but the level of additional dividend will be a bit lower than financial year 2014.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So to sum up, our performance in financial year 2014 has been strong and shows the benefits of our restructuring coming through.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It has been underpinned by excellent performance in the Private Equity business, achieving an annual cash operating profit, a significant milestone for the group, and an outperformance against all the strategic targets that we set out in June 2012.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The momentum in the business continues, and we are well placed to build further value for shareholders in the next year of transition and delivery.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So thank you, and Simon and I would now be happy to take questions Okay, let me take the first 2, and then Julia can deal with the Action question.",1473
18511,"2014m5","On realizations, I think it's -- I would probably choose to modify my view a little.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Looking at our pipeline at the moment, and this is always subject to what might happen out there, I think we'll be at a similar level to the year just finished.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So it's a bit stronger in terms of the realization pipeline, I would suggest.",1473
18511,"2014m5","On pricing and the environment in general, I think we're at a -- we are at a very interesting place.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are clearly benefiting from buoyant conditions in the realization program.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we are getting very good prices, sometimes on even quite mediocre investments that we're selling.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The flip side of that is the competitive and high-priced nature of the investment environment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we have been using and focusing on our platform very hard to find stuff away from these very busy auctions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But that is clearly harder to do than just asking for a book on everything that's being sold.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And if you look back over statistics for Private Equity, and as I've said before, 3i has its own library on this, given how long it's been around, while we all like to feel we're geniuses in Private Equity, vintage is the biggest determinant of returns, and therefore, you need to moderate your excitement and compulsion to invest when banks are banging on your door with large debt packages and other things because it's generally a pretty good sign that this might not be one of the finer vintages for investing.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that in reality, meter [ph] accounts for an awful lot of returns, both going up and going down in the Private Equity sector.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I think the smart people who are really smart will be quite careful about investing in this environment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And I'm pretty glad we don't have a fund with lots of money burning a hole in our pocket because we might feel under more pressure to buy stuff than we actually do.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we'll continue to make investments, we'll continue to use our platform, but we are going to be very careful about the end prices because the end prices will be the biggest determinants of the returns we'll make on these investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Do you want to pick up on Action? 15, their best investment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","CVC, they're going to be holding Formula One for a long time.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I mean, there are plenty of examples of running winners in this industry if they produce a lot of cash and produce a lot of value, and we will be no different.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Any more before we wind up? Okay, well, thanks for coming.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Happy to mingle afterwards.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Ewan Lovett-Turner from Numis.",1473
18511,"2014m5","With the disposal of some of the sort of noncore investments and the focus on the keeper assets, what sort of level of portfolio concentration are you happy with going forward, how big would we see, the largest investments? It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Just a couple of questions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The first one is the example you gave about Vespa [ph], I just wanted to kind of flip it on its head because, obviously, in the last couple years, you've done quite a lot of restructuring, particularly in sort of the Southern Europe.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So are there any sort of investments you're actually missing out on because your footprint's kind of not big enough anymore? And then my second question would just be around sort of Action again.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You've mentioned you've just done a refinancing, and correct me if I'm wrong, a large portion of that refinancing comes back to 3i as a dividend.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I'm just trying to think, when is the next refinancing due and should we be expecting another kind of big dividend? Okay, I think, let's start.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Good morning, everyone.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Welcome to 3i's results for the year to 31st March, 2014.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Well, as you can see, the momentum in the business has continued, and we've had an excellent 6 months since our interim presentation last November.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've made some very promising Private Equity investments, the portfolio is developing well, realizations and cash flow have been strong, and both Infrastructure and Debt Management have achieved important milestones.",1473
18511,"2014m5","These results clearly show the very significant benefits from our restructuring in financial year '13, as well as from our new asset management initiatives.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I'd like to start by focusing on our strategic objectives and our progress over the last year and close with some comments about our business model before handing over to Julia.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's been another good year to be a shareholder in 3i, with a total shareholder return of 30%, including a 20p dividend, which gives a 6% yield on the share price at the beginning of our financial year 2014.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've achieved the second year of 40%-plus returns on our Private Equity realizations.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we have returned to the new investment market with GBP 372 million in 3 new and 1 large follow-on investment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've again materially outperformed our second year cost-saving targets of GBP 60 million by coming in at GBP 70 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And as you can see, the operational leakages we have suffered from are now a thing of the past, with cash income in the year exceeding our new reduced cost base by GBP 5 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You're familiar with our model, so I'd like to start by focusing on our strategic objectives and our progress over the year and close with some comments about our business model before handing over to Julia.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's important to note at this stage that we have made good progress in our 2 smaller businesses: Infrastructure and Debt Management, as well as Private Equity.",1473
18511,"2014m5","These results we've delivered reflect every aspect of 3i's value build.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is not just to jam tomorrow's story, this is jam today, as well as jam tomorrow.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The portfolio is delivering growth in earnings and value and it's been another strong year of realizations.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Cash flow relative to costs has been strong, and we've made good progress in Fund Management profits.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've made some excellent new investments, as well as a strategic acquisition in the infrastructure sector.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we've significantly raised our shareholder distributions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are now more than halfway through the plan I set out in June 2012.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we now have real momentum in the face of transition and delivery after our fundamental restructuring in financial year 2013.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We had 6 strategic priorities for financial year 2014, and we've either exceeded or met every single one, as you can see here.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's been a great year for Private Equity, and I'd like to say well done to the 3i PE team.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've seen strong growth in our proprietary portfolio through both earnings and valuation multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we've seen a good flow of realizations at excellent uplifts and decent cash on cash multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Julia will give you a couple of examples in a minute.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Once again, we've not been selling any of our keeper assets, but we have sold the mix from our buckets 2, 3 and 4.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Those disposals have given us a meaningful reduction in the number of smaller problem investments in our portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","New investment has picked up, but we've been very careful to be disciplined on price and careful to be consistent with our strategic focus.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've added 5 new executives in the last 6 months, bringing our total number of investors to 59.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we have a stable core partner team balanced across our key geographies, and they are focusing on our core sectors of industrial consumer and business services.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've seen very strong returns across our European and U.",1473
18511,"2014m5","businesses, and the 2011 onwards investments have performed particularly well.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'm delighted to see how the team has embraced the asset management initiatives, which we put in place during 2012.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are monitoring the portfolio closely, and we're focusing hard on those situations where performance is below our expectations.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Right at the start, I said that it has been another excellent year for realizations, and here's how they look.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've delivered proceeds of GBP 669 million at a 43% uplift to opening values.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The money multiple is 1 -- of 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","8x is very good, especially when we've sold a decent number of our smaller or underperforming investments during the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now I'd like to talk briefly about portfolio segmentation or what I call the buckets.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're seeing excellent earnings growth in our keepers bucket, which now accounts for over 40% of the PE portfolio value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Action is the standout investment here.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But we have a number of other promising investments, which have the potential to drive cash on cash returns significantly above 2x over the medium term.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And they include a number of our most recent investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Of our 24 realizations, 6 were either partial realizations or from bucket 2, and 18 were from buckets 3 and 4.",1473
18511,"2014m5","That shows you the extent of the tidying-up exercises here and how we have now reduced the portfolio to 81 companies from over 100.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I expect the value of our keepers bucket to continue to grow well over the next 12 months.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we will also see a further reduction in the number of overall investments in the portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And I'm very excited about the PE investments we've made this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We made a significant follow-on investment in Scandlines, which has already been a strong investment for 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is a large keeper bucket asset, and we're anticipating a strong value growth over the medium term, as Steve Ridgway, the new Chairman and former CEO of Virgin Atlantic, works with the existing management team of Scandlines.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Basic-Fit, JMJ and GIF are all new investments, which are consistent with our strategic focus on local origination of international companies.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We maintained our price discipline on these assets, buying all of them at attractive multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now looking around the room, I can see there's a number of you who are fitness fanatics.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Don't worry, Bill, I wasn't looking at you.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I want to tell you about my day with Rene Moos, the CEO of Basic-Fit.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This was last September, and this was before we bought the business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And I think it shows how we find deals and the power of 3i's international franchise.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Basic-Fit is the largest discount fitness operator in Europe.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've known the business for several years and have tracked it since 2011.",1473
18511,"2014m5","To give you an idea of its scale, it had 64,000 new members in January this year alone.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Rene is a former professional tennis player.",1473
18511,"2014m5","He's highly competitive, and he's a gifted businessman.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We first approached Rene, the Founder and CEO of Basic-Fit, in 2011, after our consumer team had identified discount as the winning theme in retail and the retail services sector.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Rene had 3 businesses at the time: a golf course business, an upmarket gym business and Basic-Fit.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We approached him at roughly the same time we approached and purchased Action.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But Rene wasn't interested in our approach.",1473
18511,"2014m5","He didn't accept that the discount format was his best business and was unconvinced by our arguments that discount was a business to scale up and make his fortune in.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But after reading about and seeing the success of Action, Rene contacted our Amsterdam team in early 2003 -- 2013 and asked for a meeting to discuss the success of Action and our current thoughts on Basic-Fit.",1473
18511,"2014m5","When I met Rene in September and toured Basic-Fit, I was impressed by his energy and detailed understanding of the Basic-Fit business and the broader fitness market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","At the washup meeting with him at the end of it all and the day and before I supported the investment proposal, I asked him why he was dealing with 3i and haven't talked to any other buyout firms, and I liked what I heard.",1473
18511,"2014m5","He said, ""Your PE team has educated me on the potential of Basic-Fit, on where I would succeed.",1473
18511,"2014m5","For too long, I've been dazzled by the upmarket gym business without really understanding the power of a large-scale, value-for-money discount franchise.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And your team is Dutch, which is important to me.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They've been investing in Dutch companies for decades, they speak my language, and they have a great track record in this market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I would rather work with your local Dutch team than deal with Brits or Americans, who fly in and out of ship hold on an irregular basis.",1473
18511,"2014m5",""" This was an interesting comment, given 5 minutes earlier, I'd ask him to ask his PA to print my boarding card.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But anyway, as you can say, Rene can be very direct and is a classic entrepreneur.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now that's what I'd call competitive advantage.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are on the ground, and we have the skills to identify companies with strong potential, and we can provide financial and operational support.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It was the same for Action, and it gives us the opportunity to invest in these strong businesses away from the froth of hotly contested auctions in London.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Infrastructure has continued to make good contribution to the group's annual cash income.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And the European portfolio has performed well.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The new leadership team has settled in quickly and has agreed with 3iN to further extend the advisory agreement.",1473
18511,"2014m5","India had a challenging time again, and we saw a further pullback in the valuations, although we did see a more stable second half.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've also broadened our platform through the acquisition of a PPP-focused team from Barclays.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They have a strong pipeline of deals, and we are now focusing on the next fundraising.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We now have 25 investors in London and Paris and 6 investors in Mumbai.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Debt Management has delivered another productive year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They've raised 4 new CLOs in the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5","and in the newly opened European market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And they manage GBP 6.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5 billion of AUM.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And they're now in the top 10 global CLO managers.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You'll be pleased to hear that we significantly overreached on cost savings for our second year in a row.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our cost metrics are now very much in line with the rest of the industry.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Including the 2 acquisitions, Fraser Sullivan and BIFM, the group's now got operating costs of about GBP 129 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our cash income actually exceeded operating costs in financial year 2014, and that's something the group has not achieved for a very long time.",1473
18511,"2014m5","That outcome was a direct result of our cost-reduction program.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is a tight metric for 3i because of our preponderance of Proprietary Capital, so I'm particularly pleased by this step this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've also significantly cut our interest bill.",1473
18511,"2014m5","By repaying debt, it's now down to GBP 54 million from GBP 101 million in our last financial year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we've now fully implemented our new compensation arrangements, and they've closely aligned senior staff to our key strategic objectives.",1473
18511,"2014m5","3i shares now make up a significant element of variable compensation, and that gives us further alignment with the shareholders.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now I'd like to move to financial year '15, the second year of our transition and delivery phase.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Here are our strategic priorities for the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They're clear, but fundamentally, they remain focused on thoughtful and well-executed asset management, careful new investments and tight cost control.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And if we achieve that, we will deliver another year of marked improvement in capital efficiency and allocation, as we did this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This shift you can see in capital allocations is increasing cash for new investments and shareholder distributions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now let me turn to the group's business model.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have a hybrid model.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have a large portfolio of proprietary investments, as well as acting as a fund manager for third-party capital.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The weight of our Proprietary Capital in mid-market Private Equity is the fundamental driver of our results and gives us the competitive advantage in closing new investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're an active owner of investments, as well as being manager of third-party funds.",1473
18511,"2014m5","In our Private Equity and Infrastructure vehicles, we are the single largest investor.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We back our analysis and judgment with 3i cash, alongside the cash of our external LPs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The revenues and profits from our Fund Management activities contribute to the cost of running our investment platforms, and they create another source of value for 3i shareholders, especially as our Fund Management franchise grows.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We want you to be able to track our progress in Proprietary Capital investing and as a fund manager.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We think this greater transparency will be helpful in judging just how well we're doing.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Going forward, we'll be using this core set of KPIs so that you can track our progress and performance at group level in our returns on Proprietary Capital and from our Fund Management activities.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'd like to close by saying we've had a very good year, where we have seen the clear benefits from our restructuring and from our new asset management initiatives in Private Equity.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've also been clearing up our Private Equity portfolio, and we've put out the fires.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have good earnings momentum across the portfolio, and cash flow is strong, particularly in our larger investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have some very special investments in our keeper bucket of assets, and as I said a minute ago, they now account for over 40% of portfolio value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We think they are capable of very strong growth over the medium term.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are, of course, hostage to broader economic and political trends.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But subject to those broader trends, I would expect to see another strong year for 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As the portfolio moves forward, we take advantage of bouyant realization markets, and we remain energetic but selective when finding new investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So on that note, I'd like to pass over to Julia to give you more detailed color on the results.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So would it be fair to say it's largely on price, that you're not investing more? Yes.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So there was a refinancing in Action in the first half.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And actually, because of the way that was structured, that came back as proceeds to us.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we received GBP 59 million of proceeds in the first half.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As I said, it's got very good free cash flow.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And post that refinancing, net debt is now down to 3.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we will obviously continue to look at ways of making sure that that's the most efficient, and we could be looking at further refinancings in the future.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Okay, let me take the first 2, and then Julia can deal with the Action question.",1473
18511,"2014m5","On realizations, I think it's -- I would probably choose to modify my view a little.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Looking at our pipeline at the moment, and this is always subject to what might happen out there, I think we'll be at a similar level to the year just finished.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So it's a bit stronger in terms of the realization pipeline, I would suggest.",1473
18511,"2014m5","On pricing and the environment in general, I think we're at a -- we are at a very interesting place.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are clearly benefiting from buoyant conditions in the realization program.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we are getting very good prices, sometimes on even quite mediocre investments that we're selling.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The flip side of that is the competitive and high-priced nature of the investment environment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we have been using and focusing on our platform very hard to find stuff away from these very busy auctions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But that is clearly harder to do than just asking for a book on everything that's being sold.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And if you look back over statistics for Private Equity, and as I've said before, 3i has its own library on this, given how long it's been around, while we all like to feel we're geniuses in Private Equity, vintage is the biggest determinant of returns, and therefore, you need to moderate your excitement and compulsion to invest when banks are banging on your door with large debt packages and other things because it's generally a pretty good sign that this might not be one of the finer vintages for investing.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that in reality, meter [ph] accounts for an awful lot of returns, both going up and going down in the Private Equity sector.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I think the smart people who are really smart will be quite careful about investing in this environment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And I'm pretty glad we don't have a fund with lots of money burning a hole in our pocket because we might feel under more pressure to buy stuff than we actually do.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we'll continue to make investments, we'll continue to use our platform, but we are going to be very careful about the end prices because the end prices will be the biggest determinants of the returns we'll make on these investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Do you want to pick up on Action? Do you want to deal with the Action one first? Daniel Garrod, Barclays.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Simon, a question for you first, and then one for Julia.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You mentioned a couple of times the sort of strong external environment, what you achieved in full year '14, before then accelerating again in 2016, 2017.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Have your thoughts changed from that kind of outlook because of what you're seeing around the external environment? And in the outlook, it kind of reads the pricing for new investments remains quite difficult.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You're indicating there you've done 4 deals in sort of recent months, that we could see a sort of slow and cautious approach there on the investment side.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And then a question for Julia on what exactly you've done on Action.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It looked -- so GBP 500 million valuation of Action at March.",1473
18511,"2014m5","At September, I think that equivalent figure was GBP 300 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The split of that, it -- from what you've said around the sensitivity, it strikes me about 60% of that is the multiple uplift, and about 40% is earnings growth.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Am I right, ballpark, in that estimation? I mean, I would just add on Action, when you look at it, because it's been a subject of significant discussion within 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Clearly, the IPO of Poundland has had an impact, and there are quite strong signals that B&M, another hard discounter in the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5",", is coming to the market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But if you just reference Poundland, we've put this thing on a 12.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5x EBITDA multiple on these run rate earnings compared to something like Poundland that's trading on 18x to 19x on a prospective EBITDA multiple.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So there's plenty of room there.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The difference between the 2 is that Action is growing strongly in 4 big economies: Germany, France, Holland and Belgium.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It has materially higher like-for-likes.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's opening over 100 new stores this year, and it's gotten very high returns on equity.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So this is quite, quite an interesting business in our portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Iain Scouller.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The multiples one.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I would say that the increase in the average multiple in the year, clearly, the Action multiple has an impact, and we've given you the numbers, excluding the Action impact.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So that's a 9.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We talked at the Q3 trading statement that we would cap multiples, taking into account a number of factors.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We thought the market was moving up.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've got good performance in a number of our assets, and so we have tweaked some multiples up as we go through.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I mean, to answer your specific question about new investments, no, the investments that we've been -- we've done have been lower than those sort of averages that we've just been talking about, so it's not -- they're not a cause of the impact.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's more market driven and Action driven.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And then on the CLO equity performance, yes, we've seen some good returns coming out of that.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have a relatively modest amount of capital in the business, but it can generate good, double-digit returns for us.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I've got a couple.",1473
18511,"2014m5","First, there's obviously quite a big increase in the multiples used on the valuation over the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Did the inclusion of new investments at presumably relatively higher multiples have much of an impact on this number? And the second one is the CLO portfolios.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about the performance of that.",1473
18511,"2014m5","There seemed to be a number of gains coming through there.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Do you want to take this? Thanks, Simon, and good morning, everybody.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This has been a year of strong delivery, and we've generated real momentum, and you can see the evidence in the results that Simon and I are talking about today.",1473
18511,"2014m5","One point I want to note just at the start, this year, we've adopted a new accounting consolidation standard.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It has no effect on the results, but it changes the components of our returns, balance sheet and cash flow, and that means that the audited financial statutory statements actually look very different.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And it's a bit hard to see the detailed picture, so we decided that it would be more helpful to present the numbers today on the basis that's consistent with previous periods.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We believe that this makes our results easier to understand, and we're calling this our investment basis.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that's what we used in our press release this morning as well.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'm not going to go through the change in detail here today.",1473
18511,"2014m5","There's an explanation and reconciliation in the press release and some explanatory slides in the back of your packs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Of course, I'm happy to take any questions at the end of the presentation, but enough of the technicalities.",1473
18511,"2014m5","3% total return we have delivered is a great result and all the more so because the numbers are after the headwind of Sterling's strength, which I'll come onto in a minute.",1473
18511,"2014m5","At a group level, we have achieved an annual cash operating profit of GBP 5 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is an important milestone.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It demonstrates that our financial model is far more sustainable and that we can make capital allocation decisions without leakage from our cost base.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As you know and as Simon confirmed a minute ago, we've made great progress in reducing our costs, but staying focused on the cash operating profit means we won't lose sight of this operational efficiency.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But as well as efficiency, we've built momentum for growth during the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have put our Proprietary Capital to work, making cash investment of GBP 337 million in Private Equity and Debt Management.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we've continued to strengthen the balance sheet, with the realizations of GBP 677 million of good money multiples and a further reduction in gross debt to GBP 857 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're now giving more information about the profitability of our Fund Management platform, and this is for the first time.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'm going to take you through that in more detail later, but note here that fee income is stable, and we've improved both profitability and margin.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We closed the period with NAV per share of 348p.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And you can see here how that has progressed since December and over the course of the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Very strong performance from our Private Equity portfolio in realizations and portfolio value growth, significant reductions in our cost base and interest bill mean that the dilution of those returns is dramatically lower.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But there is a reduction from the increase in our carry provision because of the strong portfolio performance and in FX translation loss as sterling has strengthened.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Finally, we paid 1/3 of our proposed 20p dividend in January, and together with last year's final dividend, that gives you the 12.",1473
18511,"2014m5","1p that you can see here.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So first, let's look at the performance of our Private Equity business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The GBP 647 million gross investment return that we've generated is 24% over opening portfolio valuation of GBP 2.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And within that, the return from the core Northern European and North American portfolio was excellent at 30%, and that now accounts for 90% of the total portfolio value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Simon talked about some of the significant realizations that have driven the realized profits of GBP 201 million and the uplift of 43% over opening value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Just to note, as you may have already seen in the press release, we're now reporting gross investment return after foreign exchange movements on the portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So the GBP 647 million that you can see here is net of the translation loss of GBP 100 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So what are the drivers of the unrealized value growth? The weighted average 12 months earnings growth for those companies that we value using earnings was 19%, driven particularly by the assets in our keepers bucket, such as Action and Element.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We talked a lot around the Q3 IMS about our cautioned in following the market up when we set our valuation multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is still the case, but we will re-rate companies if we think that their performance and our expectations about exit potential merit it.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'm going to talk separately about how we valued Action in a minute because it has a big affect on the numbers that you can see here.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Before I do, please also note the low level of companies that are being valued using forecast earnings.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We do that when earnings are lower than the last 12 months to anticipate a downturn in performance, so a low number here, just 3% by value, is a good metric.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Net debt in the portfolio stayed low at an average of 3.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And 79% of that debt is now due up to 2016, as we've taken opportunities to refinance.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So there's been quite a lot of focus on our investment in Action.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It is clearly a material part of the book, so I'm going to give you some more specific detail about how we valued it.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've been using the run rate adjusted earning since this time last year to reflect the significant growth in the business from store openings.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The success of the management team in that store rollout and strong like-for-likes now gives us the confidence to reset the comparable multiples and to include high-growth companies which we've previously excluded.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And of course, the recent IPO of Poundland has given us a new data point.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we've increased the post-discount multiple from 10x to 12.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Action generates very good free cash flow.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And after the refinancing that we did last summer, its net debt is only 3.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Having made these changes, we now hold Action in our books at a value of GBP 501 million, which is 14.",1473
18511,"2014m5","1% of our portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","All other things being equal, at the 31st of March, an increase in the multiple from 12.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5x would increase our book value by GBP 50 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And by the way, this is one of the reasons why we're putting a resolution at the AGM to amend our investment policy.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Since our keeper assets demonstrate strong growth, we have a so-called nice problem to have, that single asset could account for more than 15% of portfolio value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that's a limit in our current investment policy.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now we don't think it makes sense for us to have to reduce an investment if we think there is better shareholder value to be had by keeping the investment for longer.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we're proposing to change the limit to apply it to investment cost rather than value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Coming back to the valuations in total, you can see here how the earnings growth and stable net debt in the portfolio as a whole means strong growth of GBP 182 million from performance.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The single biggest driver of the GBP 216 million increase in value from multiples is that decision to increase the Action multiple.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Valuation of Scandlines is included in the DCF line.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And since the further investments and appointment to the new Chairman, we're positive about the outlook for this business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The combined value of the old and new money has increased by GBP 21 million since that acquisition.",1473
18511,"2014m5","In the [indiscernible] portfolio, particularly Quintiles and GAIN Capital in the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5",", have performed very well in the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","With this strong performance overall, the top 20 Private Equity assets now account for 76% of the total Private Equity portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Here they are.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And you can see there's only a few exceptions, where our view is not positive on performance.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that is generally true in the remainder of the portfolio, as we've had another year with no provisions or material write-downs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","A consequence of this strong performance is that the provision that we make for carry payable has stepped up materially in the last quarter.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we pay carry on our Proprietary Capital investment to the investment teams at rates of between 10% and 15% in schemes set every 2 years.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Every quarter, we test each scheme to see whether it would've hit its performance hurdle if we'd sold all the assets at the balance sheet value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And if it has, they may accrue carry as if the asset is being sold, but we discount it to reflect that the actual payment date may be many years into the future.",1473
18511,"2014m5","When a scheme hits the hurdle for the first time, there's also a catch-up effect.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The 2010 to 2012 assets have performed particularly strongly.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This scheme includes Action.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And it's hit its hurdle for the first time this year on an accruals basis.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Rate on the scheme is just below 15%, and the provision for this scheme makes up the biggest part of the charge.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We received carry on third-party capital over the life of the relevant funds, some of which is then shared with the investment teams.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The performance of Eurofund V has improved dramatically, with the current fund multiple increasing to 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","13x at the 31st of March.",1473
18511,"2014m5","However, that's not a strong enough recovery to let us start accruing for carry receivable on this fund.",1473
18511,"2014m5","In fact, the drag from the 2007 to 2009 investments in this fund means we haven't recognized its carry receivable yet.",1473
18511,"2014m5","In cash terms, carry paid and carry received on cash realizations in schemes actually through their hurdles was much lower at GBP 25 million and GBP 5 million, respectively.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Let me now turn to Infrastructure, where it's been comparatively quieter year, although, as you have seen from 3i Infrastructure plc's results last week, there have been some good developments, with building our PPP capability and progress on the renewal of our advisory agreement with 3iN.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our 34% shareholding in 3iN delivers good dividend income.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We received GBP 21 million this year, a very important underpin to our cash profit metric.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The core European portfolio continues to perform well, but the performance of the Indian portfolio has been disappointing.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The value of our direct holding in these investments fell by 25%.",1473
18511,"2014m5","That includes the significant rupee and dollar depreciation in the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The PPP platform already covers its costs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And further fundraising by that team will also make a positive contribution to the cash profit metric and the group's Fund Management profitability.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our Debt Management business has the biggest contributor to that Fund Management profitability.",1473
18511,"2014m5","During the year, it closed 2 new CLOs in Europe and 2 in the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5",", and that added GBP 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","2 million -- GBP 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","2 billion assets under management and offset the run-off of the older funds.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We finished the year with assets under management of GBP 6.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Fee income was stable at GBP 32 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But as I said at the half year, the catch-up fees on older funds contributed GBP 6 million last year, and they no longer feature.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Excluding these catch-up fees, fee income grew by GBP 7 million, so an overall improvement in the quality of earnings.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Bringing together Fund Management contributions from all our businesses, you can see here the profitability of 3i's platform.",1473
18511,"2014m5","When we look at the Fund Management business's profitability, we recognize that it should receive a notional fee on the Proprietary Capital that it's managing on behalf of 3i Group's shareholders.",1473
18511,"2014m5","These synthetic fees are set with reference to our third-party fund mandates.",1473
18511,"2014m5","For this year and last, they're set at 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5% on our capital invested in Private Equity and Infrastructure and at 0.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5% on Debt Management capital.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've also allocated operating expenses between the Fund Management platform and to the Proprietary Capital investment business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The positive impact from cost savings, as Simon talked about earlier, flow through here, with the reduction from GBP 140 million last year to GBP 108 million this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So with stable combined fee income, the Fund Management platform became profitable for the first time at an absolute level.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And when we take out restructuring and amortization costs, underlying profit was GBP 33 million, and that's a respectable margin of 26%.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our Proprietary Capital business has also seen an improvement year-on-year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I've already talked about good realized profit and strong value growth.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The majority of
[Audio Gap] 
portfolio is invested outside the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5",", with 51% denominated in euros and 16% in dollars.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So revaluing this portfolio in a period where sterling has strengthened does result in significant differences.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're talking about a translation loss of GBP 113 million against a GBP 52 million gain last year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is how that movement is made up.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And based on the balance sheet at the 3st of March, a further 1% movement in the euro or dollar would change returns by GBP 13 million and GBP 6 million, respectively.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Proprietary Capital business has the balance sheet funding costs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You can see here the very positive impact of our gross debt reduction, with interest payable down 47% to GBP 54 million in the year, well ahead of our GBP 60 million target.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The most significant aspect of Proprietary Capital investments was the increase in momentum in Private Equity, although we remain highly selective about opportunities.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As Simon talked about, we made cash investment of GBP 276 million in Private Equity, including 3 new investments: Basic-Fit, GIF and JMJ, and the further investment in Scandlines with Eurofund V.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our Proprietary Capital lets us support the growth of our Debt Management business through warehouse vehicles, which are used to build up credit portfolios in order to cede CLO launches and to avoid cash drag on returns.",1473
18511,"2014m5","At the 31st of March, we had a total of GBP 21 million invested in our European and U.",1473
18511,"2014m5","warehouse vehicles, ahead of the next CLO launches in these regions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We also invest in the equity of a CLO when it is launched.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is particularly important because new regulatory developments require fund managers to have skin in the game.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our Proprietary Capital means that we can do that.",1473
18511,"2014m5","During the year, we invested GBP 40 million into the 4 new CLOs raised.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Core Infrastructure investment is principally funded by 3i Infrastructure plc, and we've had no other calls on the Proprietary Capital for that business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Bringing all this together on the group balance sheet, investment momentum has improved in the year, but market conditions mean that it's a better time for realizations.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we finished the year with net cash divestment of GBP 340 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The portfolio value increased to GBP 3.",1473
18511,"2014m5","6 billion because of the effect of the net divestment was offset by strong value growth.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We used proceeds from realizations to reduce gross debt.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Gross debt reduced to GBP 857 million, and net debt to GBP 160 million, with gearing that's only 5%.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we have clearly satisfied the criteria to operate our enhanced distribution policy.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we indicated at the half year that we expected to pay a dividend of 20p in total for this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Realizations have been good.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Investment levels have improved.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But as Simon talked about, the environment for mid-market Private Equity investing remains very competitive.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Taking these factors into account, we have confirmed the 20p dividend today.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Subject to shareholder approval, we declared a final dividend of 13.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As for the year that we're now in, we expect to pay above our 8.",1473
18511,"2014m5","1p base level dividend again, but the level of additional dividend will be a bit lower than financial year 2014.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So to sum up, our performance in financial year 2014 has been strong and shows the benefits of our restructuring coming through.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It has been underpinned by excellent performance in the Private Equity business, achieving an annual cash operating profit, a significant milestone for the group, and an outperformance against all the strategic targets that we set out in June 2012.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The momentum in the business continues, and we are well placed to build further value for shareholders in the next year of transition and delivery.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So thank you, and Simon and I would now be happy to take questions Thanks, Julia.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Daniel? I think we -- the 15% cost is clearly the new policy.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I think, as a company, we would, in general, like to work well within that figure because I would expect, as we reshape the portfolio, we'll come down to a natural number of, say, 30 investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We'll have, hopefully, in that 30 no bucket 4 investments, we'll have very few bucket 3, so it'll be bucket 1 or 2.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So it will be a more balanced value across the 30 assets.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But when we have a truly special investment, like an Action, we need to be able to run that sort of winner, take a leaf out of Warren Buffett's book, and that's what we'd do, and we want the flexibility to do that if we find such a thing.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And there are other examples of that around the Private Equity world, where people have run winners for a very long time.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I know Electra [ph] one of Chris's [ph] favorites stocks, they ran -- how long did they handle [ph] Flex 4, was it 10 years or something? Yes, I think it's very likely there'll be an Action refinancing this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I think on are we missing out because we're no longer proactively investing in, say, Southern Europe, we don't feel we are.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We still feel there's a lot of issues in that market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And in the sort of sectors that we're looking in, we think there are better opportunities where we have the core teams at the moment, so we don't think we're losing out materially.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Ewan Lovett-Turner from Numis.",1473
18511,"2014m5","With the disposal of some of the sort of noncore investments and the focus on the keeper assets, what sort of level of portfolio concentration are you happy with going forward, how big would we see, the largest investments? 15, their best investment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","CVC, they're going to be holding Formula One for a long time.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I mean, there are plenty of examples of running winners in this industry if they produce a lot of cash and produce a lot of value, and we will be no different.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Any more before we wind up? Okay, well, thanks for coming.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Happy to mingle afterwards.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's very much on price.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have the best pipeline of potential new investments that I've seen since I joined 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we're getting a good look at quite a lot of stuff, but we're discarding quite a lot because of the relationship with price and expectation.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Any more? One at the front.",1473
18511,"2014m5","To give you a rough guidance, and I'll give it to you, from March to March, the value at March was GBP 280 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And as you correctly say, the value at the end of this financial year was GBP 501 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","There are -- the really important dynamic in Action is the strong earnings growth that we see both in very good like-for-likes but also the store rollout program that they've got.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And as I've talked about, we adjust for that in the earnings of these valuations by adding a sort of pro forma on stores being opened, and that's the run rate basis that we're using.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And then as I've said, we've also taken the decision to step up the multiple to recognize that growth rate.",1473
18511,"2014m5","If you look at the movement from March to March, there is more benefit coming from the earnings growth than the multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's a shade beyond the 50% comes from earnings, it's probably about 55%, 45%, something like that.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I think we -- the 15% cost is clearly the new policy.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I think, as a company, we would, in general, like to work well within that figure because I would expect, as we reshape the portfolio, we'll come down to a natural number of, say, 30 investments.",1473

18511,"2014m5","I know Electra [ph] one of Chris's [ph] favorites stocks, they ran -- how long did they handle [ph] Flex4 [ph], was it 10 years or something? I mean, I would just add on Action, when you look at it, because it's been a subject of significant discussion within 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Clearly, the IPO of Poundland has had an impact, and there are quite strong signals that B&M, another hard discounter in the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5",", is coming to the market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But if you just reference Poundland, we've put this thing on a 12.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5x EBITDA multiple on these run rate earnings compared to something like Poundland that's trading on 18x to 19x on a prospective EBITDA multiple.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So there's plenty of room there.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The difference between the 2 is that Action is growing strongly in 4 big economies: Germany, France, Holland and Belgium.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It has materially higher like-for-likes.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's opening over 100 new stores this year, and it's gotten very high returns on equity.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So this is quite, quite an interesting business in our portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Iain Scouller.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Do you want to deal with the Action one first? It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Just a couple of questions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The first one is the example you gave about Vespa [ph], I just wanted to kind of flip it on its head because, obviously, in the last couple years, you've done quite a lot of restructuring, particularly in sort of the Southern Europe.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So are there any sort of investments you're actually missing out on because your footprint's kind of not big enough anymore? And then my second question would just be around sort of Action again.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You've mentioned you've just done a refinancing, and correct me if I'm wrong, a large portion of that refinancing comes back to 3i as a dividend.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I'm just trying to think, when is the next refinancing due and should we be expecting another kind of big dividend? Thanks, Simon, and good morning, everybody.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This has been a year of strong delivery, and we've generated real momentum, and you can see the evidence in the results that Simon and I are talking about today.",1473
18511,"2014m5","One point I want to note just at the start, this year, we've adopted a new accounting consolidation standard.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It has no effect on the results, but it changes the components of our returns, balance sheet and cash flow, and that means that the audited financial statutory statements actually look very different.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And it's a bit hard to see the detailed picture, so we decided that it would be more helpful to present the numbers today on the basis that's consistent with previous periods.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We believe that this makes our results easier to understand, and we're calling this our investment basis.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that's what we used in our press release this morning as well.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'm not going to go through the change in detail here today.",1473
18511,"2014m5","There's an explanation and reconciliation in the press release and some explanatory slides in the back of your packs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Of course, I'm happy to take any questions at the end of the presentation, but enough of the technicalities.",1473
18511,"2014m5","3% total return we have delivered is a great result and all the more so because the numbers are after the headwind of sterling's strength, which I'll come onto in a minute.",1473
18511,"2014m5","At a group level, we have achieved an annual cash operating profit of GBP 5 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is an important milestone.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It demonstrates that our financial model is far more sustainable and that we can make capital allocation decisions without leakage from our cost base.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As you know and as Simon confirmed a minute ago, we've made great progress in reducing our costs, but staying focused on the cash operating profit means we won't lose sight of this operational efficiency.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But as well as efficiency, we've built momentum for growth during the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have put our Proprietary Capital to work, making cash investment of GBP 337 million in Private Equity and Debt Management.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we've continued to strengthen the balance sheet, with the realizations of GBP 677 million of good money multiples and a further reduction in gross debt to GBP 857 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're now giving more information about the profitability of our Fund Management platform, and this is for the first time.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'm going to take you through that in more detail later, but note here that fee income is stable, and we've improved both profitability and margin.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We closed the period with NAV per share of 348p.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And you can see here how that has progressed since December and over the course of the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Very strong performance from our Private Equity portfolio in realizations and portfolio value growth, significant reductions in our cost base and interest bill mean that the dilution of those returns is dramatically lower.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But there is a reduction from the increase in our carry provision because of the strong portfolio performance and in FX translation loss as sterling has strengthened.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Finally, we paid 1/3 of our proposed 20p dividend in January, and together with last year's final dividend, that gives you the 12.",1473
18511,"2014m5","1p that you can see here.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So first, let's look at the performance of our Private Equity business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The GBP 647 million gross investment return that we've generated is 24% over opening portfolio valuation of GBP 2.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And within that, the return from the core Northern European and North American portfolio was excellent at 30%, and that now accounts for 90% of the total portfolio value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Simon talked about some of the significant realizations that have driven the realized profits of GBP 201 million and the uplift of 43% over opening value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Just to note, as you may have already seen in the press release, we're now reporting gross investment return after foreign exchange movements on the portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So the GBP 647 million that you can see here is net of the translation loss of GBP 100 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So what are the drivers of the unrealized value growth? The weighted average 12 months earnings growth for those companies that we value using earnings was 19%, driven particularly by the assets in our keepers bucket, such as Action and Element.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We talked a lot around the Q3 IMS about our cautioned in following the market up when we set our valuation multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is still the case, but we will re-rate companies if we think that their performance and our expectations about exit potential merit it.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'm going to talk separately about how we valued Action in a minute because it has a big effect on the numbers that you can see here.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Before I do, please also note the low level of companies that are being valued using forecast earnings.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We do that when earnings are lower than the last 12 months to anticipate a downturn in performance, so a low number here, just 3% by value, is a good metric.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Net debt in the portfolio stayed low at an average of 3.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And 79% of that debt is now due up to 2016, as we've taken opportunities to refinance.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So there's been quite a lot of focus on our investment in Action.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It is clearly a material part of the book, so I'm going to give you some more specific detail about how we valued it.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've been using the run rate adjusted earning since this time last year to reflect the significant growth in the business from store openings.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The success of the management team in that store rollout and strong like-for-likes now gives us the confidence to reset the comparable multiples and to include high-growth companies which we've previously excluded.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And of course, the recent IPO of Poundland has given us a new data point.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we've increased the post-discount multiple from 10x to 12.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Action generates very good free cash flow.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And after the refinancing that we did last summer, its net debt is only 3.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Having made these changes, we now hold Action in our books at a value of GBP 501 million, which is 14.",1473
18511,"2014m5","1% of our portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","All other things being equal, at the 31st of March, an increase in the multiple from 12.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5x would increase our book value by GBP 50 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And by the way, this is one of the reasons why we're putting a resolution at the AGM to amend our investment policy.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Since our keeper assets demonstrate strong growth, we have a so-called nice problem to have, that single asset could account for more than 15% of portfolio value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that's a limit in our current investment policy.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now we don't think it makes sense for us to have to reduce an investment if we think there is better shareholder value to be had by keeping the investment for longer.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we're proposing to change the limit to apply it to investment cost rather than value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Coming back to the valuations in total, you can see here how the earnings growth and stable net debt in the portfolio as a whole means strong growth of GBP 182 million from performance.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The single biggest driver of the GBP 216 million increase in value from multiples is that decision to increase the Action multiple.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Valuation of Scandlines is included in the DCF line.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And since the further investments and appointment to the new Chairman, we're positive about the outlook for this business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The combined value of the old and new money has increased by GBP 21 million since that acquisition.",1473
18511,"2014m5","In the equities [ph]] portfolio, particularly Quintiles and GAIN Capital in the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5",", have performed very well in the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","With this strong performance overall, the top 20 Private Equity assets now account for 76% of the total Private Equity portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Here they are.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And you can see there's only a few exceptions, where our view is not positive on performance.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that is generally true in the remainder of the portfolio, as we've had another year with no provisions or material write-downs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","A consequence of this strong performance is that the provision that we make for carry payable has stepped up materially in the last quarter.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we pay carry on our Proprietary Capital investment to the investment teams at rates of between 10% and 15% in schemes set every 2 years.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Every quarter, we test each scheme to see whether it would've hit its performance hurdle if we'd sold all the assets at the balance sheet value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And if it has, they may accrue carry as if the asset is being sold, but we discount it to reflect that the actual payment date may be many years into the future.",1473
18511,"2014m5","When a scheme hits the hurdle for the first time, there's also a catch-up effect.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The 2010 to 2012 assets have performed particularly strongly.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This scheme includes Action.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And it's hit its hurdle for the first time this year on an accruals basis.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Rate on the scheme is just below 15%, and the provision for this scheme makes up the biggest part of the charge.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We received carry on third-party capital over the life of the relevant funds, some of which is then shared with the investment teams.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The performance of Eurofund V has improved dramatically, with the current fund multiple increasing to 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","13x at the 31st of March.",1473
18511,"2014m5","However, that's not a strong enough recovery to let us start accruing for carry receivable on this fund.",1473
18511,"2014m5","In fact, the drag from the 2007 to 2009 investments in this fund means we haven't recognized its carry receivable yet.",1473
18511,"2014m5","In cash terms, carry paid and carry received on cash realizations in schemes actually through their hurdles was much lower at GBP 25 million and GBP 5 million, respectively.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Let me now turn to Infrastructure, where it's been comparatively quieter year, although, as you have seen from 3i Infrastructure plc's results last week, there have been some good developments, with building our PPP capability and progress on the renewal of our advisory agreement with 3iN.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our 34% shareholding in 3iN delivers good dividend income.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We received GBP 21 million this year, a very important underpin to our cash profit metric.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The core European portfolio continues to perform well, but the performance of the Indian portfolio has been disappointing.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The value of our direct holding in these investments fell by 25%.",1473
18511,"2014m5","That includes the significant rupee and dollar depreciation in the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The PPP platform already covers its costs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And further fundraising by that team will also make a positive contribution to the cash profit metric and the group's Fund Management profitability.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our Debt Management business has the biggest contributor to that Fund Management profitability.",1473
18511,"2014m5","During the year, it closed 2 new CLOs in Europe and 2 in the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5",", and that added GBP 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","2 million -- GBP 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","2 billion assets under management and offset the run-off of the older funds.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We finished the year with assets under management of GBP 6.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Fee income was stable at GBP 32 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But as I said at the half year, the catch-up fees on older funds contributed GBP 6 million last year, and they no longer feature.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Excluding these catch-up fees, fee income grew by GBP 7 million, so an overall improvement in the quality of earnings.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Bringing together Fund Management contributions from all our businesses, you can see here the profitability of 3i's platform.",1473
18511,"2014m5","When we look at the Fund Management business's profitability, we recognize that it should receive a notional fee on the Proprietary Capital that it's managing on behalf of 3i Group's shareholders.",1473
18511,"2014m5","These synthetic fees are set with reference to our third-party fund mandates.",1473
18511,"2014m5","For this year and last, they're set at 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5% on our capital invested in Private Equity and Infrastructure and at 0.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5% on Debt Management capital.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've also allocated operating expenses between the Fund Management platform and to the Proprietary Capital investment business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The positive impact from cost savings, as Simon talked about earlier, flow through here, with the reduction from GBP 140 million last year to GBP 108 million this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So with stable combined fee income, the Fund Management platform became profitable for the first time at an absolute level.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And when we take out restructuring and amortization costs, underlying profit was GBP 33 million, and that's a respectable margin of 26%.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our Proprietary Capital business has also seen an improvement year-on-year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I've already talked about good realized profit and strong value growth.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The majority of
[Audio Gap] 
portfolio is invested outside the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5",", with 51% denominated in euros and 16% in dollars.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So revaluing this portfolio in a period where sterling has strengthened does result in significant differences.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're talking about a translation loss of GBP 113 million against a GBP 52 million gain last year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is how that movement is made up.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And based on the balance sheet at the 3st of March, a further 1% movement in the euro or dollar would change returns by GBP 13 million and GBP 6 million, respectively.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Proprietary Capital business has the balance sheet funding costs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You can see here the very positive impact of our gross debt reduction, with interest payable down 47% to GBP 54 million in the year, well ahead of our GBP 60 million target.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The most significant aspect of Proprietary Capital investments was the increase in momentum in Private Equity, although we remain highly selective about opportunities.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As Simon talked about, we made cash investment of GBP 276 million in Private Equity, including 3 new investments: Basic-Fit, GIF and JMJ, and the further investment in Scandlines with Eurofund V.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our Proprietary Capital lets us support the growth of our Debt Management business through warehouse vehicles, which are used to build up credit portfolios in order to cede CLO launches and to avoid cash drag on returns.",1473
18511,"2014m5","At the 31st of March, we had a total of GBP 21 million invested in our European and U.",1473
18511,"2014m5","warehouse vehicles, ahead of the next CLO launches in these regions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We also invest in the equity of a CLO when it is launched.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is particularly important because new regulatory developments require fund managers to have skin in the game.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our Proprietary Capital means that we can do that.",1473
18511,"2014m5","During the year, we invested GBP 40 million into the 4 new CLOs raised.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Core Infrastructure investment is principally funded by 3i Infrastructure plc, and we've had no other calls on the Proprietary Capital for that business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Bringing all this together on the group balance sheet, investment momentum has improved in the year, but market conditions mean that it's a better time for realizations.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we finished the year with net cash divestment of GBP 340 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The portfolio value increased to GBP 3.",1473
18511,"2014m5","6 billion because of the effect of the net divestment was offset by strong value growth.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We used proceeds from realizations to reduce gross debt.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Gross debt reduced to GBP 857 million, and net debt to GBP 160 million, with gearing that's only 5%.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we have clearly satisfied the criteria to operate our enhanced distribution policy.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we indicated at the half year that we expected to pay a dividend of 20p in total for this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Realizations have been good.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Investment levels have improved.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But as Simon talked about, the environment for mid-market Private Equity investing remains very competitive.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Taking these factors into account, we have confirmed the 20p dividend today.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Subject to shareholder approval, we declared a final dividend of 13.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As for the year that we're now in, we expect to pay above our 8.",1473
18511,"2014m5","1p base level dividend again, but the level of additional dividend will be a bit lower than financial year 2014.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So to sum up, our performance in financial year 2014 has been strong and shows the benefits of our restructuring coming through.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It has been underpinned by excellent performance in the Private Equity business, achieving an annual cash operating profit, a significant milestone for the group, and an outperformance against all the strategic targets that we set out in June 2012.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The momentum in the business continues, and we are well placed to build further value for shareholders in the next year of transition and delivery.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So thank you, and Simon and I would now be happy to take questions Ewan Lovett-Turner from Numis.",1473
18511,"2014m5","With the disposal of some of the sort of noncore investments and the focus on the keeper assets, what sort of level of portfolio concentration are you happy with going forward, how big would we see, the largest investments? It's very much on price.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have the best pipeline of potential new investments that I've seen since I joined 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we're getting a good look at quite a lot of stuff, but we're discarding quite a lot because of the relationship with price and expectation.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Any more? One at the front.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Thanks, Julia.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Daniel? 15, their best investment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","CVC, they're going to be holding Formula One for a long time.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I mean, there are plenty of examples of running winners in this industry if they produce a lot of cash and produce a lot of value, and we will be no different.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Any more before we wind up? Okay, well, thanks for coming.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Happy to mingle afterwards.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So would it be fair to say it's largely on price, that you're not investing more? Daniel Garrod, Barclays.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Simon, a question for you first, and then one for Julia.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You mentioned a couple of times the sort of strong external environment, what you achieved in full year '14, before then accelerating again in 2016, 2017.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Have your thoughts changed from that kind of outlook because of what you're seeing around the external environment? And in the outlook, it kind of reads the pricing for new investments remains quite difficult.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You're indicating there you've done 4 deals in sort of recent months, that we could see a sort of slow and cautious approach there on the investment side.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And then a question for Julia on what exactly you've done on Action.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It looked -- so GBP 500 million valuation of Action at March.",1473
18511,"2014m5","At September, I think that equivalent figure was GBP 300 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The split of that, it -- from what you've said around the sensitivity, it strikes me about 60% of that is the multiple uplift, and about 40% is earnings growth.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Am I right, ballpark, in that estimation? Okay, I think, let's start.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Good morning, everyone.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Welcome to 3i's results for the year to 31st March, 2014.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Well, as you can see, the momentum in the business has continued, and we've had an excellent 6 months since our interim presentation last November.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've made some very promising Private Equity investments, the portfolio is developing well, realizations and cash flow have been strong, and both Infrastructure and Debt Management have achieved important milestones.",1473
18511,"2014m5","These results clearly show the very significant benefits from our restructuring in financial year '13, as well as from our new asset management initiatives.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I'd like to start by focusing on our strategic objectives and our progress over the last year and close with some comments about our business model before handing over to Julia.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's been another good year to be a shareholder in 3i, with a total shareholder return of 30%, including a 20p dividend, which gives a 6% yield on the share price at the beginning of our financial year 2014.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've achieved the second year of 40%-plus returns on our Private Equity realizations.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we have returned to the new investment market with GBP 372 million in 3 new and 1 large follow-on investment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've again materially outperformed our second year cost-saving targets of GBP 60 million by coming in at GBP 70 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And as you can see, the operational leakages we have suffered from are now a thing of the past, with cash income in the year exceeding our new reduced cost base by GBP 5 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You're familiar with our model, so I'd like to start by focusing on our strategic objectives and our progress over the year and close with some comments about our business model before handing over to Julia.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's important to note at this stage that we have made good progress in our 2 smaller businesses: Infrastructure and Debt Management, as well as Private Equity.",1473
18511,"2014m5","These results we've delivered reflect every aspect of 3i's value build.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is not just to jam tomorrow's story, this is jam today, as well as jam tomorrow.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The portfolio is delivering growth in earnings and value and it's been another strong year of realizations.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Cash flow relative to costs has been strong, and we've made good progress in Fund Management profits.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've made some excellent new investments, as well as a strategic acquisition in the infrastructure sector.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we've significantly raised our shareholder distributions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are now more than halfway through the plan I set out in June 2012.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we now have real momentum in the face of transition and delivery after our fundamental restructuring in financial year 2013.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We had 6 strategic priorities for financial year 2014, and we've either exceeded or met every single one, as you can see here.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's been a great year for Private Equity, and I'd like to say well done to the 3i PE team.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've seen strong growth in our proprietary portfolio through both earnings and valuation multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we've seen a good flow of realizations at excellent uplifts and decent cash on cash multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Julia will give you a couple of examples in a minute.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Once again, we've not been selling any of our keeper assets, but we have sold the mix from our buckets 2, 3 and 4.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Those disposals have given us a meaningful reduction in the number of smaller problem investments in our portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","New investment has picked up, but we've been very careful to be disciplined on price and careful to be consistent with our strategic focus.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've added 5 new executives in the last 6 months, bringing our total number of investors to 59.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we have a stable core partner team balanced across our key geographies, and they are focusing on our core sectors of industrial consumer and business services.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've seen very strong returns across our European and U.",1473
18511,"2014m5","businesses, and the 2011 onwards investments have performed particularly well.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'm delighted to see how the team has embraced the asset management initiatives, which we put in place during 2012.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are monitoring the portfolio closely, and we're focusing hard on those situations where performance is below our expectations.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Right at the start, I said that it has been another excellent year for realizations, and here's how they look.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've delivered proceeds of GBP 669 million at a 43% uplift to opening values.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The money multiple is 1 -- of 1.",1473
18511,"2014m5","8x is very good, especially when we've sold a decent number of our smaller or underperforming investments during the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now I'd like to talk briefly about portfolio segmentation or what I call the buckets.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're seeing excellent earnings growth in our keepers bucket, which now accounts for over 40% of the PE portfolio value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Action is the standout investment here.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But we have a number of other promising investments, which have the potential to drive cash on cash returns significantly above 2x over the medium term.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And they include a number of our most recent investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Of our 24 realizations, 6 were either partial realizations or from bucket 2, and 18 were from buckets 3 and 4.",1473
18511,"2014m5","That shows you the extent of the tidying-up exercises here and how we have now reduced the portfolio to 81 companies from over 100.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I expect the value of our keepers bucket to continue to grow well over the next 12 months.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we will also see a further reduction in the number of overall investments in the portfolio.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And I'm very excited about the PE investments we've made this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We made a significant follow-on investment in Scandlines, which has already been a strong investment for 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is a large keeper bucket asset, and we're anticipating a strong value growth over the medium term, as Steve Ridgway, the new Chairman and former CEO of Virgin Atlantic, works with the existing management team of Scandlines.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Basic-Fit, JMJ and GIF are all new investments, which are consistent with our strategic focus on local origination of international companies.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We maintained our price discipline on these assets, buying all of them at attractive multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now looking around the room, I can see there's a number of you who are fitness fanatics.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Don't worry, Bill, I wasn't looking at you.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I want to tell you about my day with Rene Moos, the CEO of Basic-Fit.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This was last September, and this was before we bought the business.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And I think it shows how we find deals and the power of 3i's international franchise.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Basic-Fit is the largest discount fitness operator in Europe.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've known the business for several years and have tracked it since 2011.",1473
18511,"2014m5","To give you an idea of its scale, it had 64,000 new members in January this year alone.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Rene is a former professional tennis player.",1473
18511,"2014m5","He's highly competitive, and he's a gifted businessman.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We first approached Rene, the Founder and CEO of Basic-Fit, in 2011, after our consumer team had identified discount as the winning theme in retail and the retail services sector.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Rene had 3 businesses at the time: a golf course business, an upmarket gym business and Basic-Fit.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We approached him at roughly the same time we approached and purchased Action.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But Rene wasn't interested in our approach.",1473
18511,"2014m5","He didn't accept that the discount format was his best business and was unconvinced by our arguments that discount was a business to scale up and make his fortune in.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But after reading about and seeing the success of Action, Rene contacted our Amsterdam team in early 2003 -- 2013 and asked for a meeting to discuss the success of Action and our current thoughts on Basic-Fit.",1473
18511,"2014m5","When I met Rene in September and toured Basic-Fit, I was impressed by his energy and detailed understanding of the Basic-Fit business and the broader fitness market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","At the washup meeting with him at the end of it all and the day and before I supported the investment proposal, I asked him why he was dealing with 3i and haven't talked to any other buyout firms, and I liked what I heard.",1473
18511,"2014m5","He said, ""Your PE team has educated me on the potential of Basic-Fit, on where I would succeed.",1473
18511,"2014m5","For too long, I've been dazzled by the upmarket gym business without really understanding the power of a large-scale, value-for-money discount franchise.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And your team is Dutch, which is important to me.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They've been investing in Dutch companies for decades, they speak my language, and they have a great track record in this market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I would rather work with your local Dutch team than deal with Brits or Americans, who fly in and out of ship hold on an irregular basis.",1473
18511,"2014m5",""" This was an interesting comment, given 5 minutes earlier, I'd ask him to ask his PA to print my boarding card.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But anyway, as you can say, Rene can be very direct and is a classic entrepreneur.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now that's what I'd call competitive advantage.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are on the ground, and we have the skills to identify companies with strong potential, and we can provide financial and operational support.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It was the same for Action, and it gives us the opportunity to invest in these strong businesses away from the froth of hotly contested auctions in London.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Infrastructure has continued to make good contribution to the group's annual cash income.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And the European portfolio has performed well.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The new leadership team has settled in quickly and has agreed with 3iN to further extend the advisory agreement.",1473
18511,"2014m5","India had a challenging time again, and we saw a further pullback in the valuations, although we did see a more stable second half.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've also broadened our platform through the acquisition of a PPP-focused team from Barclays.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They have a strong pipeline of deals, and we are now focusing on the next fundraising.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We now have 25 investors in London and Paris and 6 investors in Mumbai.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Debt Management has delivered another productive year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They've raised 4 new CLOs in the U.",1473
18511,"2014m5","and in the newly opened European market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And they manage GBP 6.",1473
18511,"2014m5","5 billion of AUM.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And they're now in the top 10 global CLO managers.",1473
18511,"2014m5","You'll be pleased to hear that we significantly overreached on cost savings for our second year in a row.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our cost metrics are now very much in line with the rest of the industry.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Including the 2 acquisitions, Fraser Sullivan and BIFM, the group's now got operating costs of about GBP 129 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Our cash income actually exceeded operating costs in financial year 2014, and that's something the group has not achieved for a very long time.",1473
18511,"2014m5","That outcome was a direct result of our cost-reduction program.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This is a tight metric for 3i because of our preponderance of Proprietary Capital, so I'm particularly pleased by this step this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've also significantly cut our interest bill.",1473
18511,"2014m5","By repaying debt, it's now down to GBP 54 million from GBP 101 million in our last financial year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we've now fully implemented our new compensation arrangements, and they've closely aligned senior staff to our key strategic objectives.",1473
18511,"2014m5","3i shares now make up a significant element of variable compensation, and that gives us further alignment with the shareholders.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now I'd like to move to financial year '15, the second year of our transition and delivery phase.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Here are our strategic priorities for the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","They're clear, but fundamentally, they remain focused on thoughtful and well-executed asset management, careful new investments and tight cost control.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And if we achieve that, we will deliver another year of marked improvement in capital efficiency and allocation, as we did this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","This shift you can see in capital allocations is increasing cash for new investments and shareholder distributions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Now let me turn to the group's business model.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have a hybrid model.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have a large portfolio of proprietary investments, as well as acting as a fund manager for third-party capital.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The weight of our Proprietary Capital in mid-market Private Equity is the fundamental driver of our results and gives us the competitive advantage in closing new investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We're an active owner of investments, as well as being manager of third-party funds.",1473
18511,"2014m5","In our Private Equity and Infrastructure vehicles, we are the single largest investor.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We back our analysis and judgment with 3i cash, alongside the cash of our external LPs.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The revenues and profits from our Fund Management activities contribute to the cost of running our investment platforms, and they create another source of value for 3i shareholders, especially as our Fund Management franchise grows.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We want you to be able to track our progress in Proprietary Capital investing and as a fund manager.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We think this greater transparency will be helpful in judging just how well we're doing.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Going forward, we'll be using this core set of KPIs so that you can track our progress and performance at group level in our returns on Proprietary Capital and from our Fund Management activities.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I'd like to close by saying we've had a very good year, where we have seen the clear benefits from our restructuring and from our new asset management initiatives in Private Equity.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've also been clearing up our Private Equity portfolio, and we've put out the fires.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have good earnings momentum across the portfolio, and cash flow is strong, particularly in our larger investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have some very special investments in our keeper bucket of assets, and as I said a minute ago, they now account for over 40% of portfolio value.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We think they are capable of very strong growth over the medium term.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are, of course, hostage to broader economic and political trends.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But subject to those broader trends, I would expect to see another strong year for 3i.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As the portfolio moves forward, we take advantage of buoyant realization markets, and we remain energetic but selective when finding new investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So on that note, I'd like to pass over to Julia to give you more detailed color on the results.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Do you want to take this? It's Iain Scouller from Oriel Securities.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I've got a couple.",1473
18511,"2014m5","First, there's obviously quite a big increase in the multiples used on the valuation over the year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Did the inclusion of new investments at presumably relatively higher multiples have much of an impact on this number? And the second one is the CLO portfolios.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about the performance of that.",1473
18511,"2014m5","There seemed to be a number of gains coming through there.",1473
18511,"2014m5","To give you a rough guidance, and I'll give it to you, from March to March, the value at March was GBP 280 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And as you correctly say, the value at the end of this financial year was GBP 501 million.",1473
18511,"2014m5","There are -- the really important dynamic in Action is the strong earnings growth that we see both in very good like-for-likes but also the store rollout program that they've got.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And as I've talked about, we adjust for that in the earnings of these valuations by adding a sort of pro forma on stores being opened, and that's the run rate basis that we're using.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And then as I've said, we've also taken the decision to step up the multiple to recognize that growth rate.",1473
18511,"2014m5","If you look at the movement from March to March, there is more benefit coming from the earnings growth than the multiples.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's a shade beyond the 50% comes from earnings, it's probably about 55%, 45%, something like that.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So there was a refinancing in Action in the first half.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And actually, because of the way that was structured, that came back as proceeds to us.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we received GBP 59 million of proceeds in the first half.",1473
18511,"2014m5","As I said, it's got very good free cash flow.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And post that refinancing, net debt is now down to 3.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we will obviously continue to look at ways of making sure that that's the most efficient, and we could be looking at further refinancings in the future.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Okay, let me take the first 2, and then Julia can deal with the Action question.",1473
18511,"2014m5","On realizations, I think it's -- I would probably choose to modify my view a little.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Looking at our pipeline at the moment, and this is always subject to what might happen out there, I think we'll be at a similar level to the year just finished.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So it's a bit stronger in terms of the realization pipeline, I would suggest.",1473
18511,"2014m5","On pricing and the environment in general, I think we're at a -- we are at a very interesting place.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We are clearly benefiting from buoyant conditions in the realization program.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we are getting very good prices, sometimes on even quite mediocre investments that we're selling.",1473
18511,"2014m5","The flip side of that is the competitive and high-priced nature of the investment environment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And we have been using and focusing on our platform very hard to find stuff away from these very busy auctions.",1473
18511,"2014m5","But that is clearly harder to do than just asking for a book on everything that's being sold.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And if you look back over statistics for Private Equity, and as I've said before, 3i has its own library on this, given how long it's been around, while we all like to feel we're geniuses in Private Equity, vintage is the biggest determinant of returns, and therefore, you need to moderate your excitement and compulsion to invest when banks are banging on your door with large debt packages and other things because it's generally a pretty good sign that this might not be one of the finer vintages for investing.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And that in reality, meter [ph] accounts for an awful lot of returns, both going up and going down in the Private Equity sector.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I think the smart people who are really smart will be quite careful about investing in this environment.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And I'm pretty glad we don't have a fund with lots of money burning a hole in our pocket because we might feel under more pressure to buy stuff than we actually do.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So we'll continue to make investments, we'll continue to use our platform, but we are going to be very careful about the end prices because the end prices will be the biggest determinants of the returns we'll make on these investments.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Do you want to pick up on Action? The multiples one.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So I would say that the increase in the average multiple in the year, clearly, the Action multiple has an impact, and we've given you the numbers, excluding the Action impact.",1473
18511,"2014m5","So that's a 9.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We talked at the Q3 trading statement that we would cap multiples, taking into account a number of factors.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We thought the market was moving up.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We've got good performance in a number of our assets, and so we have tweaked some multiples up as we go through.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I mean, to answer your specific question about new investments, no, the investments that we've been -- we've done have been lower than those sort of averages that we've just been talking about, so it's not -- they're not a cause of the impact.",1473
18511,"2014m5","It's more market driven and Action driven.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And then on the CLO equity performance, yes, we've seen some good returns coming out of that.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We have a relatively modest amount of capital in the business, but it can generate good, double-digit returns for us.",1473
18511,"2014m5","Yes, I think it's very likely there'll be an Action refinancing this year.",1473
18511,"2014m5","I think on are we missing out because we're no longer proactively investing in, say, Southern Europe, we don't feel we are.",1473
18511,"2014m5","We still feel there's a lot of issues in that market.",1473
18511,"2014m5","And in the sort of sectors that we're looking in, we think there are better opportunities where we have the core teams at the moment, so we don't think we're losing out materially.",1473
18511,"2015m11","We are a cornerstone investor in the new Global Fund, which is another big chunk of it.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean it's worth bundling a bit on Debt Management, we have seen quite choppy markets there, particularly in the U.",801
18511,"2015m11",", actually more so than Europe.",801
18511,"2015m11","But again, I think in line with 3i's current behaviors, we have encouraged the credit team there to really take care of any loans we are worried about and move them out of the portfolio as quickly.",801
18511,"2015m11","So we've been quite aggressive at addressing those problems so we don't have problems down the road, and encouraging those teams to then build back value in loans where they see better promise going forward.",801
18511,"2015m11","So again, I think we are being a little ahead of the curve in heading off some of the problems that might come through in that market in the states.",801
18511,"2015m11","And we have a relatively light exposure to oil and gas compared to most of the CLO issues in the States.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's not a sector that we've ever liked and it's a big sector.",801
18511,"2015m11","Richard? Simon, sorry, it's Iain Scouller from Stifel.",801
18511,"2015m11","Simon, I note the British comments on bucket 1, what multiple is bucket 1 valued as of the end of September? Okay.",801
18511,"2015m11","Just a follow-up quickly, and then on the debt management side, would there be any implication, for example, Dublin some of the fund manager or anything like that? Thank you, Simon.",801
18511,"2015m11","So another half year of solid performance, with all 3 of our businesses making important progress.",801
18511,"2015m11","And it's another set of results which give you the evidence of how 3i is a business with the sound fundamentals it takes to perform well against a difficult economic and political backdrop.",801
18511,"2015m11","We are continuing to build value for our shareholders through strong development of earnings growth in the Private Equity portfolio.",801
18511,"2015m11","Constructed markets, particularly in the first quarter, led to realizations of GBP 359 million and further progress on reshaping the Private Equity portfolio.",801
18511,"2015m11","We remain focused on our operating cash profitability.",801
18511,"2015m11","That way, we can make sure we have a sustainable and sound operating platform.",801
18511,"2015m11","And all of this is supported by maintaining a strong balance sheet so that our investment teams can invest well at sensible prices and to support enhanced distributions to our investors.",801
18511,"2015m11","Now as you are all aware, this has been a volatile 6 months.",801
18511,"2015m11","And this slide shows you how our NAV share developed over the 2 quarters to the 30th of September.",801
18511,"2015m11","You can see that our Proprietary Capital made a strong contribution to NAV, both through realized profits and through value growth.",801
18511,"2015m11","Material interperiod swings on FX more or less canceled each other out over the 6 months.",801
18511,"2015m11","And after the payment of the final dividend of 14p in July, NAV pence per share was 401p at the 30th of September.",801
18511,"2015m11","So we delivered a total return of 4.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have said that all 3 businesses made important progress in the period.",801
18511,"2015m11","I'm now going to take you through the financial contribution each business made to our results.",801
18511,"2015m11","I'd like to start with Private Equity, which accounts for 81% of the Proprietary Capital portfolio at the end of September.",801
18511,"2015m11","Strong portfolio earnings growth supported growth investment return of GBP 246 million.",801
18511,"2015m11","The impact from multiple movements was lower than you might expect given the fall in global equity markets in August and September, and I'll come on to talk about valuations in a minute.",801
18511,"2015m11","Realized profits of GBP 26 million came from the full disposals of 9 assets, the IPO of UFO, partial sales of Quintiles, as well as the remittance of proceeds from Scandlines January disposal of the route.",801
18511,"2015m11","Together, these transactions generated GBP 307 million.",801
18511,"2015m11","The 9% uplift over value reflects the fact that the number of assets were held at imminent sale at the year-end, so we're talking about assets such as Azelis, Soyaconcept and Touchtunes.",801
18511,"2015m11","Simon described our increased focus on our stronger assets and new investments, and that is reflected in the strength of the portfolio earnings growth, which you can see here.",801
18511,"2015m11","As you can see, a very small proportion of value is made up of companies with falling earnings.",801
18511,"2015m11","And although Action remains an important contributor to the 19% profile, the growth, excluding Action, remains a healthy 14%.",801
18511,"2015m11","That, together with movements on net debt, is what led to the strong performance of GBP 171 million in portfolio value growth on this slide.",801
18511,"2015m11","We valued 30 companies on an earnings basis at the 30th of September.",801
18511,"2015m11","As usual, we used the last 12 months earnings to the 30th of June and[ph] less the most recent forecast to December 2015 showed a decline in performance.",801
18511,"2015m11","5 out of the 30 companies have been valued on a forecast earnings basis as a result of macroeconomic factors, such as oil and gas sector exposure and currency volatility.",801
18511,"2015m11","The negative multiple movement of GBP 24 million reflects the deterioration in equity markets in August and September.",801
18511,"2015m11","As I've talked about for some time, we have adjusted down the multiples we use in our valuations when we think the multiple implied by the quality comparables is ahead of our view of longer-term multiples and/or our exit expectations.",801
18511,"2015m11","We also consider the particular size and footprint of our investments.",801
18511,"2015m11","We did this for 22 out of 33 companies at March, and we continued to do it for 19 out of 30 companies at September, even after taking into account the fall in equity markets during our second quarter.",801
18511,"2015m11","Simon showed you that we have taken value reductions as a result of multiples for assets such as AES, Hanko and Dynatect.",801
18511,"2015m11","On the other hand, we increased the multiple we used to value Basic-Fit to 10.",801
18511,"2015m11","5x post-discount.",801
18511,"2015m11","For those of you who were able to attend the Investor Day in June, you will have seen the ambition of this business.",801
18511,"2015m11","That is accelerating.",801
18511,"2015m11","And the new multiple reflects the growth potential of this business, as it invests to upgrade existing gyms and to build and acquire new ones.",801
18511,"2015m11","We made no change to the multiple we used to value Action, which remains at 3.",801
18511,"2015m11","5x post-discount.",801
18511,"2015m11","In the tcf category, the positive movement of GBP 28 million was driven by the good performance of Scandlines.",801
18511,"2015m11","In our view, that the competing fixed link is likely to be delayed by at least another year.",801
18511,"2015m11","Now this good momentum, particularly over the last 12 months, flows through to the accrual for carry payable.",801
18511,"2015m11","And more schemes are forecast to meet the performance hurdles if you assume we sold everything at its current value.",801
18511,"2015m11","We expect to accrue carry at between 10% to 15% of Private Equity gross investment return, but we only pay out when the hurdle is met with cash returns.",801
18511,"2015m11","To give you the specific number, we paid out GBP 13 million in the first half.",801
18511,"2015m11","There is a negative receivable balance in this half, and this is a one-off accounting adjustment to the growth capital fund accrual, which went through its hurdle for the first time last year.",801
18511,"2015m11","As well as generating good value growth and realizations, the Private Equity business makes an important contribution to our operating cash profit.",801
18511,"2015m11","We confirmed in May that we have no plans in the short to medium term to raise a new third-party fund for Private Equity investment.",801
18511,"2015m11","This makes a lot of sense from a shareholder return perspective.",801
18511,"2015m11","But it means that the Private Equity fee income will continue to decline as we sell investments from our third-party funds, such as Eurofund 5.",801
18511,"2015m11","However, the Private Equity portfolio itself generates income and made a strong contribution of GBP 22 million to operating cash income.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our infrastructure business has also made a good contribution to group performance in the first half.",801
18511,"2015m11","The teams increased investments activity has demonstrated that they are able to deploy of funds well in a highly attractive sector.",801
18511,"2015m11","And that has been well received by 3iN's investors.",801
18511,"2015m11","3iN generated a TSR of 7%, and we received an ordinary dividend of GBP 11 million.",801
18511,"2015m11","And that GBP 11 million is included in our operating cash profit.",801
18511,"2015m11","3iN also paid a special dividend in July following the completion of the sale of its investment in Eversholt Rail, and we have treated this GBP 51 million as realization proceeds.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our investments in the Indian Infrastructure Fund continued to be impacted by the weakness in the road and power sectors and the rupee.",801
18511,"2015m11","That has led to a value reduction of GBP 9 million, partly offsetting the good contribution from the European businesses.",801
18511,"2015m11","Debt Management had a busy 6 months, and AUM is now GBP 7.",801
18511,"2015m11","They closed new CLOs in Europe and the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","and launched their Global Income Fund.",801
18511,"2015m11","That vehicle uses the combined expertise of our European and U.",801
18511,"2015m11","Debt Management is primarily a fund management business and it generated another GBP 17 million of fees and operating cash income of GBP 33 million for 3i.",801
18511,"2015m11","We do invest proprietary capital in debt management, principally for regulatory reasons to meet the skin in the game rules for CLO fundraising or to support a new product, such as the Global Income Fund.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our investment in CLO equity generates a good cash income for us.",801
18511,"2015m11","We received GBP 14 million in the first half.",801
18511,"2015m11","All else equal, we expect the CLO equity value to fall roughly in line with this GBP 14 million of distributions.",801
18511,"2015m11","But in our second quarter in particular, there was also some pullback in market sentiments and appetite, especially in the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","Together, the distributions and market volatility led to a total of GBP 18 million value reduction.",801
18511,"2015m11","I talked earlier about the importance of a sustainable operating platform and solid balance sheet in the Value Build for shareholders.",801
18511,"2015m11","You can see here the contribution all 3 businesses have made to our operating cash profit of GBP 17 million.",801
18511,"2015m11","Having transformed the cost base of the group since 2012, we remain disciplined on costs.",801
18511,"2015m11","In fact, costs have fallen to less than 1% of AUM in the first half.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have been recruiting selectively to support the growth of all 3 businesses, so our benchmark target of 1% is an important discipline to maintain.",801
18511,"2015m11","The balance sheet is strong.",801
18511,"2015m11","After paying GBP 133 million out as the final dividend in July, we closed the half with net debt of GBP 12 million.",801
18511,"2015m11","And we are well-funded, with GBP 1.",801
18511,"2015m11","2 billion of liquidity to support investments and shareholder distributions.",801
18511,"2015m11","That said, we expect to remain net sellers in this financial year, with realizations weighted towards the end of the second half.",801
18511,"2015m11","So against that background, we have declared an interim dividend of 6p today, which is just over 15% of realization proceeds, and which is made up of 2.",801
18511,"2015m11","7p base dividend and a 3.",801
18511,"2015m11","3p additional.",801
18511,"2015m11","We expect to be paying at the 20% end of our dividend range again this year.",801
18511,"2015m11","And as Simon has talked about, we expect realizations to have a lumpier profile going forward, but we are confident in enough in the outlook to confirm that we expect to pay a total dividend of at least 15p for the year.",801
18511,"2015m11","The results we are announcing today demonstrate good momentum across all 3 business lines.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our Private Equity portfolio delivered a solid performance, supported by good contributions from both Infrastructure and Debt Management to support our strong investment platform.",801
18511,"2015m11","As Simon has said, we cannot be immune to wider geopolitical and economic conditions, but the sound fundamentals of the group mean that we are well-positioned commercially and financially to be able to capitalize over time on attractive opportunities as they arise.",801
18511,"2015m11","So thank you, and we are now happy to move over to questions.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean, both the companies in Brazil are consumer companies, and they're trading relatively robust there, so they're not on the commodity sector, they're not in the industrial sector.",801
18511,"2015m11","So we haven't seen any dramatic drop in the performance.",801
18511,"2015m11","What's the issue in those countries is tending to be the exchange rate and so we've suffered on the depreciation in exchange rates.",801
18511,"2015m11","In terms of China, we have really limited exposure.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have a large reinsurance business based out of Singapore.",801
18511,"2015m11","We listed a company on the Hongkong Stock Exchange, a sort of Chinese version of Carphone Warehouse, volatile markets, but no discernible pattern.",801
18511,"2015m11","And again, that business is a consumer business.",801
18511,"2015m11","And the reinsurance business is a very unique business,, pretty unique amongst the Private Equity world, I think.",801
18511,"2015m11","Bill? Thank you.",801
18511,"2015m11","Why don't you take one> I don't think so.",801
18511,"2015m11","I think the multiple, it's heavily skewed by Action.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have 1 or 2 other businesses like -- long-established business like Element which were on aggressive multiples given the sectors they come from.",801
18511,"2015m11","And so I don't think we're too far away from the average that you see there without Action really across the buckets.",801
18511,"2015m11","Who knows? I think regulations are changing so quickly.",801
18511,"2015m11","That could be something comes out that may present issues.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have a U.",801
18511,"2015m11","capability.",801
18511,"2015m11","Obviously, we have a European capability.",801
18511,"2015m11","But there is nothing on the horizon that we are aware of immediately that would need to change the domicile of that business.",801
18511,"2015m11","Chip? Anything else? No, okay.",801
18511,"2015m11","Thanks, everyone, for coming.",801
18511,"2015m11","Appreciate it.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's about 1% this time.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's about 2% at March.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean, the one multiple we did change positively was Basic-Fit.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's growing really well.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's investing a lot in Jim's.",801
18511,"2015m11","We saw Planet Fitness float in the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","on a 15x EBITDA multiple.",801
18511,"2015m11","We saw the gym group float I think this week on a even higher multiple in the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","so we've stuck on that out and put it on a 10.",801
18511,"2015m11","On the debt management side of your Proprietary Capital, how much of that is invested in CLO equity? Okay.",801
18511,"2015m11","But it must be already on a fairly high multiple relative to cost? It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",801
18511,"2015m11","Just 2 questions.",801
18511,"2015m11","The first is I was just interested in your comments you made about some of the business indicators you're seeing have been deteriorating given the macro, particularly in industrials yet, the investment you've made it's just an industrial companies, so I was just if you could us help us think some of the of the logic there? And then and given 80% of the portfolio is basically U.",801
18511,"2015m11","or Europe, how should we think about possible BRICs and implications for? Yes.",801
18511,"2015m11","We don't actually tell you all of the companies that are in each bucket so.",801
18511,"2015m11","I don't think we break out an average across the buckets, I'm afraid.",801
18511,"2015m11","How sensitive is this valuation Scandlines to delays on the tunnel, I mean you referred today on the tunnel? Okay, I'm -- let me respond.",801
18511,"2015m11","On the industrials question, let me start from the point that we don't have any direct exposure to oil and gas, and we don't have any direct commodity exposure.",801
18511,"2015m11","So that the blackest parts of the scene are not things that we are familiar with.",801
18511,"2015m11","Where we've seen impacts where companies either have customers who deal with those sectors or have contracts servicing those sectors such as JMJ, as I noted, but Action not many of our industrial groups serve the industrial market.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's quite a limited number.",801
18511,"2015m11","And if you take , for instance, it serves the consumer market, so it's not seeing the same sorts of pressures as a Dynatect would be seeing in the States and so that market place.",801
18511,"2015m11","So when I think you think about industrial sectors, you need to look at the end markets that those companies serve in order to come to a proper view.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean the other thing I would say to balance this is that our consumer portfolio, in particular, is trading really very strongly and the consumer sector looks very different to the narrow industrial sector that we have concerns about.",801
18511,"2015m11","The other business we bought, Euro Diesel, it basically makes these diesel engines to deal with supply, power supply problems for data centers.",801
18511,"2015m11","The growth in data centers around the world is phenomenal and it hasn't affected that business at all in any of these industrial stuff.",801
18511,"2015m11","So they're out with the issues I'm talking about on the industrial sector.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean, on the Braxis question, frankly, I don't know what it means.",801
18511,"2015m11","I don't know how serious this will be for a lot of companies.",801
18511,"2015m11","We don't really have a huge number of U.",801
18511,"2015m11","companies that export large amounts to the rest of Europe.",801
18511,"2015m11","So in that sense, I think the issue is quite narrow for us.",801
18511,"2015m11","I don't think it will affect at all where we invest or how we work our business.",801
18511,"2015m11","So I'm not convinced if the vote went one way or the other, it would make a huge difference to 3i's portfolio or the returns.",801
18511,"2015m11","Let me deal with both of those.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean, we had some important discussions about the development of Action and the management succession question in the first half of this year, and that really led to the CEO change that we've announced.",801
18511,"2015m11","And essentially, we wanted that commitment from management for at least 4 or 5 years because we do see a likely realization event probably calendar '17, something like that.",801
18511,"2015m11","That could be an IPO or it could be something else, but that is a sort of broad target.",801
18511,"2015m11","And if we're IPO-ing it, we want to make sure the team were in place for a good period after that.",801
18511,"2015m11","And Ronald has done a fantastic job at Action, and he is an incredibly energetic and effective CEO, but he was not prepared to commit to that time scales, so we agreed with him that as we were entering a critical phase for preparing the company for that type of event, it will be better to make a change sooner rather than later.",801
18511,"2015m11","So Sander van der Laan has come out of Ahold.",801
18511,"2015m11","He actually comes from the same part of Holland where Action comes from, so he is part of that northern Dutch community.",801
18511,"2015m11","He is incredibly familiar with the business.",801
18511,"2015m11","He has been pretty envious of the growth that he's witnessed at Action and what it did to the Albert business, which he ran for a number of years at Ahold.",801
18511,"2015m11","He is a very effective individual.",801
18511,"2015m11","He is used to running a big company.",801
18511,"2015m11","He's ran businesses for Ahold in the States as well.",801
18511,"2015m11","We interviewed quite a number of candidates for this, and he was by far the best and most suitable candidate, so we are delighted to get him.",801
18511,"2015m11","He has spent the last 3 months looking at the different countries, looking at competition and getting briefed on the business.",801
18511,"2015m11","And he formally takes over the reins at the beginning of January.",801
18511,"2015m11","Frédéric came in a CFO late summer.",801
18511,"2015m11","He was actually recruited last year, but it took time to disconnect him from where he'd been CFO.",801
18511,"2015m11","He's another very effective international executive, who work very effectively on the, superb references, and he's already doing a great job.",801
18511,"2015m11","So we have a management team in place that can see us through a big event.",801
18511,"2015m11","And that both guys have got big company experience.",801
18511,"2015m11","And Action is becoming a very big company.",801
18511,"2015m11","In terms of leverage, it's become a bit of a tradition that we do a refi action every 12 months or so.",801
18511,"2015m11","The gearing is already back below 3x EBITDA, so that could well be on the cards, Bill.",801
18511,"2015m11","It creates cash more than 100% of its earnings, so it's a very cash generative business.",801
18511,"2015m11","So the CLO equity at the end of the year was -- at the end of the period was GBP 51 million that we've done.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have about GBP 130 million in total.",801
18511,"2015m11","Bill Barnard.",801
18511,"2015m11","I note you rather glossed over on Action, the point about management change.",801
18511,"2015m11","Should I read anything into the fact you've changed both the CEO and the CFO, and there is a reference to the next leg of the strategic journey? And also I also see that Action is probably taken its leverage down a turn, might you be tempted to take that back up in the second half? Okay, good morning, everyone.",801
18511,"2015m11","Welcome to 3i's interim results.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our goal at 3i remains to deliver attractive proprietary profits from a cost-efficient investment platform.",801
18511,"2015m11","And we've had a solid first half, with all 3 of our business lines making important progress against our plans.",801
18511,"2015m11","Despite the volatility in the markets up until the end of September, we've seen a robust performance from our portfolio of proprietary investments.",801
18511,"2015m11","We've also delivered on our realization plan for the first half, and we made some new investments in Private Equity and infrastructure.",801
18511,"2015m11","Importantly, we are continuing to make strong progress on our fundamentals, the health of our Proprietary Capital portfolio and the group's financial model.",801
18511,"2015m11","The group KPIs continued to reflect the benefits of our restructuring in 2012.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our improved cash operating profit is underpinned by a resilient NAV performance and a strong balance sheet, and Julie will give you more detail on this shortly.",801
18511,"2015m11","And as I have just said, our goal remains to deliver attractive proprietary profits from a cost-efficient platform.",801
18511,"2015m11","That way, our shareholders will benefit from strong capital gains and significant cash distributions.",801
18511,"2015m11","The main driver of our capital profits is our Private Equity business where we target international midmarket investments.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our objective is to make at least 2x our money over a 4-year investment period.",801
18511,"2015m11","Once again, our Private Equity team has delivered.",801
18511,"2015m11","They have achieved a solid portfolio performance, a good level of realizations from the challenged end of our portfolio, and 2 new and 1 follow-on investment all made at sensible prices.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have continued to reshape our Private Equity portfolio by selling assets from our weaker or non-core buckets and devoting more energy and resources to our better investments.",801
18511,"2015m11","The majority of these realizations were completed early in the first half when conditions were more supportive of selling companies that either had issues or a checkered record.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have a number of important realization and refinancing initiatives running in the second half, but in the main, these include some of our stronger companies.",801
18511,"2015m11","A number of the companies we sold, such as Azelis and Lab Coat, have required intense management focus over the last few years.",801
18511,"2015m11","But the time has been well spent, and we've built back in the significant value ahead of their sales.",801
18511,"2015m11","Azelis to represent our contrasting approaches to problem assets.",801
18511,"2015m11","Along with Lab Coat, these were '07, '08 vintage assets.",801
18511,"2015m11","In the case of Azelis, the Investment Committee were very supportive of the new Chairman and CEO we put in place, and we backed that turnaround plan with funding support.",801
18511,"2015m11","This was not the case with Inspecta, where we came to the view that further funding would not be in the interest of 3i's shareholders or our LPs.",801
18511,"2015m11","As the result of our focus on rebuilding and realizing value in the bucket 3 assets, we are beginning to see a marked change in the makeup of our Private Equity portfolio.",801
18511,"2015m11","We are now down to 53 companies in 5 listed holdings from over 120 in 2012.",801
18511,"2015m11","90% of the portfolio value now resides in our keepers in bucket 1, our strong performers in bucket 2 or our remaining listed stakes.",801
18511,"2015m11","And just to remind you of the definitions, while bucket 2 is our target of 2x, in bucket 1, we are expecting to do materially better than 2x.",801
18511,"2015m11","And the quality of our current portfolio is reflected in the weighted average earnings growth of 19% in the period or 14% if we exclude action.",801
18511,"2015m11","We've had a few situations where earnings have suffered in the current environment, such as Dynatect or JMJ.",801
18511,"2015m11","Both of these businesses have suffered indirect blows from the oil and gas situation.",801
18511,"2015m11","But in the main, markdowns have come about as the result of valuation changes in specific sectors.",801
18511,"2015m11","And earnings uplifts in the portfolio have far outweighed any negative multiple adjustments.",801
18511,"2015m11","And at 3i today, just because a company suffers a marked down, that doesn't mean it's a bad business.",801
18511,"2015m11","I'd also like to say just a few words on Action, where I joined the board in March.",801
18511,"2015m11","Action goes from strength to strength, with over 80 new stores opened so far this year, with the majority of those stores being in France and Germany.",801
18511,"2015m11","The new stores in all countries are performing very well.",801
18511,"2015m11","And like-for-likes across the entire store portfolio remains strong.",801
18511,"2015m11","There is plenty of activity planned in the last few months of the year, with significant further openings in November and December, and the opening of Action's third distribution center near Paris early in the new year.",801
18511,"2015m11","Personally, I have been most struck by the energy of the company, and the laserlike focus on very low prices and how the exact same store format works in every country Action enters.",801
18511,"2015m11","And to cap it all off, Action has just won Retailer of the Year for the second year in a row in Holland amongst its peers.",801
18511,"2015m11","Scandlines, another of our large keeper assets, is having a good year, with strong earnings momentum and excellent cash flow.",801
18511,"2015m11","It should also benefit from even further delays which are now expected on the competing fixed link, Rugby Puttgarden route.",801
18511,"2015m11","Let me say a little bit more about JMJ.",801
18511,"2015m11","We acquired JMJ a couple of years ago, well before the oil price collapse.",801
18511,"2015m11","JMJ has seen projects canceled or downsized in its core oil and gas sector as a result of that price drop.",801
18511,"2015m11","But they have responded very effectively by initiating a cost reduction program across the entire firm and by focusing new business activity outside of the oil and gas sector.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's absolutely clear to us that the trading environment is becoming more difficult in a number of industrial sectors.",801
18511,"2015m11","And through our monthly dashboard monitoring process, we are very focused on supporting our management teams where they have exposure to slowing sectors or geographies or where they face other factors which were outside their control.",801
18511,"2015m11","The Private Equity team has also been busy with new investments this year, including the purchase of, a long-established German business we acquired this summer.",801
18511,"2015m11","We see as a platform asset where we have a very real opportunity to grow both organically and through M&A, playing to our strengths in the international midmarket.",801
18511,"2015m11","The infrastructure team has been very busy.",801
18511,"2015m11","They have developed a new strategy in order to broaden their investment mandate beyond the large super core sector.",801
18511,"2015m11","They backed their new approach with GBP 187 million of new investments in the first half, as well as some capable new recruits to broaden out their origination capability without losing any of their first-class asset management performance.",801
18511,"2015m11","And last, but not least, the excellent result on Eversholt financed the GBP 51 million special dividend we received from 3i Infrastructure this summer.",801
18511,"2015m11","During our first half, our debt management team has continued to perform well in more challenging markets.",801
18511,"2015m11","They have been productive in both the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","and Europe, and new CLOs, as well as with new CLOs, as well as launching a Global Income Fund, and raising further investments for the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","Senior Loan Fund and the European Middle Market Fund.",801
18511,"2015m11","And once again, the division has made a very good contribution, income contribution, with GBP 17 million of fee income in the first half, as well as GBP 14 million of CLO distributions.",801
18511,"2015m11","Now I wanted to show you this slide again, updated for September's end.",801
18511,"2015m11","It highlights well just what an efficient machine 3i has become and bodes very well for when we come to realize some of our largest investments.",801
18511,"2015m11","Operating and interest costs are now accounting for less than 15% of our annual cash flows compared to almost 70% over the period covering financial years '10, '11 and '12, leaving the bulk of our cash flows available for new investment and shareholder distributions.",801
18511,"2015m11","So it's been another decent 6 months for 3i in spite of the challenging macro picture, the volatile markets and the low point of the 30th of September.",801
18511,"2015m11","The fundamentals, our proprietary investment portfolio and the group's financial model have continued to strengthen, and each of our 3 divisions is performing well relative to their peers.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have clear strategic priorities and we are making real progress on all of them.",801
18511,"2015m11","And importantly, we have a strong balance sheet and a high quality portfolio just as the cycle is turning more difficult.",801
18511,"2015m11","Over time, the silver lining of this change in investment climate will, of course, be more opportunities on the buy side.",801
18511,"2015m11","We understand the changes in the cycle and the challenges that will bring, and the ongoing need for us to maintain our price discipline in particular, but we welcome the opportunities it will create now that we've put our own house in order.",801
18511,"2015m11","I'd like to pass over to Julia for the remainders.",801
18511,"2015m11","Charles Cade from Numis.",801
18511,"2015m11","You talked about 14% earnings growth, excluding Action, but including portfolio acquisitions, can you give any sort of idea how much portfolio acquisitions contributed to that? It's very sensitive because we assume 0 cash flow from that route once the tunnel is open.",801
18511,"2015m11","So for every year delay, it's a very considerable sum of money on top of the valuation.",801
18511,"2015m11","We think there's likely to be another formal announcement to the further delay in the coming months.",801
18511,"2015m11","There are significant budgeting issues.",801
18511,"2015m11","And the formal process that Germany has to go through to approve planning and give 2 years for appeals and various other things has not been properly factored into the Danish timetable apparently.",801
18511,"2015m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",801
18511,"2015m11","Simon, I think you've got about 1% of the portfolio Brazil, 6% in Asia, could you talk a little bit about events in those emerging markets have affected companies in those areas? Okay, good morning, everyone.",801
18511,"2015m11","Welcome to 3i's Interim Results.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our goal at 3i remains to deliver attractive proprietary profits from a cost-efficient investment platform.",801

18511,"2015m11","They've been productive in both the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","and Europe.",801
18511,"2015m11","And new CLOs as well as -- with new CLOs as well as launching a Global Income Fund and raising further investments for the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","Senior Loan Fund and the European Middle Market Fund.",801
18511,"2015m11","And once again, the division has made a very good contribution, income contribution, with GBP 17 million of fee income in the first half as well as GBP 14 million of CLO distributions.",801
18511,"2015m11","Now I wanted to show you this slide again, updated for September's end.",801
18511,"2015m11","It highlights well just what an efficient machine 3i has become and bodes very well for when we come to realize some of our largest investments.",801
18511,"2015m11","Operating and interest costs are now accounting for less than 15% of our annual cash flows compared to almost 70% over the period covering financial years '10, '11 and '12, leaving the bulk of our cash flows available for new investment and shareholder distributions.",801
18511,"2015m11","So it's been another decent 6 months for 3i in spite of the challenging macro picture, the volatile markets and the low point of the 30th of September.",801
18511,"2015m11","The fundamentals, our proprietary investment portfolio and the group's financial model have continued to strengthen, and each of our 3 divisions is performing well relative to their peers.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have clear strategic priorities, and we're making real progress on all of them.",801
18511,"2015m11","And importantly, we have a strong balance sheet and a high quality portfolio just as the cycle is turning more difficult.",801
18511,"2015m11","Over time, the silver lining of this change in investment climate will, of course, be more opportunities on the buy side.",801
18511,"2015m11","We understand the changes in the cycle and the challenges that will bring, and the ongoing need for us to maintain our price discipline in particular, but we welcome the opportunities it will create now that we've put our own house in order.",801
18511,"2015m11","I'd like to pass over to Julia for the remainder.",801
18511,"2015m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",801
18511,"2015m11","Simon, I note you've got about 1% of the portfolio in Brazil, 6% in Asia.",801
18511,"2015m11","Can you talk about a little bit about how events in those emerging markets have affected companies in those areas? I don't think we break out an average across the buckets, I'm afraid.",801
18511,"2015m11","So the CLO equity at the end of the year was -- at the end of the period was GBP 51 million that we've done.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have about GBP 130 million in total.",801
18511,"2015m11","Just to follow up quickly, and then on the debt management side, would there be any implication, for example, domicile of the fund manager or anything like that? Simon, sorry, it's Iain Scouller from Stifel.",801
18511,"2015m11","Simon, I note the British comments on bucket 1.",801
18511,"2015m11","What multiple is bucket 1 valued as of the end of September? Charles Cade from Numis.",801
18511,"2015m11","You talked about 14% earnings growth, excluding Action, but including portfolio acquisitions, can you give any sort of idea how much portfolio acquisitions contributed to that? Yes.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean, both the companies in Brazil are consumer companies, and they're trading relatively robust there actually.",801
18511,"2015m11","So they're not in the commodity sector, they're not in the industrial sector.",801
18511,"2015m11","So we haven't seen any dramatic drop in their performance.",801
18511,"2015m11","What's the issue in those countries is tending to be the exchange rate and so we've suffered on the depreciation in the exchange rate.",801
18511,"2015m11","In terms of China, we have really limited exposure.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have a large reinsurance business based out of Singapore.",801
18511,"2015m11","We listed a company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, a sort of Chinese version of Carphone Warehouse, volatile markets, but no discernible pattern.",801
18511,"2015m11","And again, that business is a consumer business.",801
18511,"2015m11","And the reinsurance business is a very unique business, pretty unique amongst the private equity world, I think.",801
18511,"2015m11","We don't actually tell you all of the companies that are in each bucket.",801
18511,"2015m11","Why don't you take one? Yes.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's about 1% this time.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's about 2% at March.",801
18511,"2015m11","Who knows? I think regulations are changing so quickly.",801
18511,"2015m11","That could be something comes out that may present issues.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have a U.",801
18511,"2015m11","capability.",801
18511,"2015m11","Obviously, we have a European capability.",801
18511,"2015m11","But there's nothing on the horizon that we're aware of immediately that would need to change the domicile of that business.",801
18511,"2015m11","Chip? I don't think so.",801
18511,"2015m11","I think the multiple, it's heavily skewed by Action.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have 1 or 2 other businesses like -- long-established business like Element, which were on aggressive multiples given the sectors they come from.",801
18511,"2015m11","So I don't think we're too far away from the average that you see there without Action really across the buckets.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean, the one multiple we did change positively was Basic-Fit.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's growing really well.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's investing a lot in gyms.",801
18511,"2015m11","We saw Planet Fitness float in the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","on a 15x EBITDA multiple.",801
18511,"2015m11","We saw The Gym Group float, I think, this week on an even higher multiple in the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","So we've stuck our neck out and put it on 10.",801
18511,"2015m11","Let me deal with both of those.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean, we had some important discussions about the development of Action and the management succession question in the first half of this year, and that really led to the CEO change that we've announced.",801
18511,"2015m11","And essentially, we wanted a commitment from management for at least 4 or 5 years because we do see a likely realization event probably calendar '17, something like that.",801
18511,"2015m11","That could be an IPO or it could be something else, but that is a sort of broad target.",801
18511,"2015m11","And if we're IPO-ing it, we want to make sure the team were in place for a good period after that.",801
18511,"2015m11","And Ronald has done a fantastic job at Action, and he is an incredibly energetic and effective CEO, but he was not prepared to commit to that timescale, so we agreed with him that, as we were entering a critical phase for preparing the company for that type of event, it will be better to make a change sooner rather than later.",801
18511,"2015m11","So Sander van der Laan who's come out of Ahold.",801
18511,"2015m11","He actually comes from the same part of Holland where Action comes from, so he's part of that Northern Dutch community.",801
18511,"2015m11","He's incredibly familiar with the business.",801
18511,"2015m11","He's been pretty envious of the growth that he's witnessed at Action and what it did to the Albert Heijn business, which he ran for a number of years at Ahold.",801
18511,"2015m11","He's a very effective individual.",801
18511,"2015m11","He's used to running a big company.",801
18511,"2015m11","He's ran businesses for Ahold in the States as well.",801
18511,"2015m11","We interviewed quite a number of candidates for this, and he was by far the best and most suitable candidate.",801
18511,"2015m11","So we're delighted to get him.",801
18511,"2015m11","He has spent the last 3 months looking at the different countries, looking at competition and getting briefed on the business.",801
18511,"2015m11","And he formally takes over the reins at the beginning of January.",801
18511,"2015m11","Frederik came in as CFO late summer.",801
18511,"2015m11","He was actually recruited last year, but it took time to disconnect him from Arla where he'd been CFO.",801
18511,"2015m11","He's another very effective international executive, worked very effectively on the Arla board, superb references, and he's already doing a great job.",801
18511,"2015m11","So we have a management team in place that can see us through a big event and they're both guys who've got big company experience.",801
18511,"2015m11","And Action is becoming a very big company.",801
18511,"2015m11","In terms of leverage, it's become a bit of a tradition that we do a refied action every 12 months or so.",801
18511,"2015m11","The gearing is already back below 3x EBITDA, so that could well be on the cards, Bill.",801
18511,"2015m11","It creates cash more than 100% of its earnings, so it's a very cash-generative business.",801
18511,"2015m11","Iain? Bill? Thank you, Simon.",801
18511,"2015m11","So another half year of solid performance with all 3 of our businesses making important progress, and it's another set of results which give you the evidence of how 3i is a business with the sound fundamentals it takes to perform well against a difficult economic and political backdrop.",801
18511,"2015m11","We are continuing to build value for our shareholders through strong development of earnings growth in the Private Equity portfolio.",801
18511,"2015m11","Constructed markets, particularly in the first quarter, led to realizations of GBP 359 million and further progress on reshaping the Private Equity portfolio.",801
18511,"2015m11","We remain focused on our operating cash profitability.",801
18511,"2015m11","That way, we can make sure we have a sustainable and sound operating platform.",801
18511,"2015m11","And all of this is supported by maintaining a strong balance sheet so that our investment teams can invest well at sensible prices and to support enhanced distributions to our investors.",801
18511,"2015m11","Now as you're all aware, this has been a volatile 6 months and this slide shows you how our NAV per share developed over the 2 quarters to the 30th of September.",801
18511,"2015m11","You can see that our Proprietary Capital made a strong contribution to NAV, both through realized profits and through value growth.",801
18511,"2015m11","Material intra-period swings on FX more or less canceled each other out over the 6 months.",801
18511,"2015m11","And after the payment of the final dividend of 14p in July, NAV pence per share was 401p at the 30th of September.",801
18511,"2015m11","So we delivered a total return of 4.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have said that all 3 businesses made important progress in the period.",801
18511,"2015m11","I'm now going to take you through the financial contribution each business made to our results.",801
18511,"2015m11","I'd like to start with Private Equity, which accounted for 81% of the Proprietary Capital portfolio at the end of September.",801
18511,"2015m11","Strong portfolio earnings growth supported gross investment return of GBP 246 million.",801
18511,"2015m11","The impact from multiple movements was lower than you might expect, given the fall in global equity markets in August and September, and I'll come on to talk about valuations in a minute.",801
18511,"2015m11","Realized profits of GBP 26 million came from the full disposals of 9 assets, the IPO of UFO, partial sales of Quintiles as well as the remittance of proceeds from Scandlines' January disposal of the H-H route.",801
18511,"2015m11","Together, these transactions generated GBP 307 million.",801
18511,"2015m11","The 9% uplift over value reflects the fact that the number of assets were held at imminent sale at the year-end, so we're talking about assets such as Azelis, Soyaconcept and Touchtunes.",801
18511,"2015m11","Simon described our increased focus on our stronger assets and new investments, and that is reflected in the strength of the portfolio earnings growth, which you can see here.",801
18511,"2015m11","As you can see, a very small proportion of value is made up of companies with falling earnings.",801
18511,"2015m11","And although Action remains an important contributor to the 19% profile, the growth, excluding Action, remains a healthy 14%.",801
18511,"2015m11","That, together with movements on net debt, is what led to the strong performance of GBP 171 million in portfolio value growth on this slide.",801
18511,"2015m11","We valued 30 companies on an earnings basis at the 30th of September.",801
18511,"2015m11","As usual, we used the last 12 months earnings to the 30th of June, unless the most recent forecast to December 2015 showed a decline in performance.",801
18511,"2015m11","5 out of the 30 companies have been valued on a forecast earnings basis as a result of macroeconomic factors such as oil and gas sector exposure and currency volatility.",801
18511,"2015m11","The negative multiple movement of GBP 24 million reflects the deterioration in equity markets in August and September.",801
18511,"2015m11","As I've talked about for some time, we have adjusted down the multiples we use in our valuations when we think the multiple implied by the quality comparables is ahead of our view of longer-term multiples and/or our exit expectations.",801
18511,"2015m11","We also consider the particular size and footprint of our investments.",801
18511,"2015m11","We did this for 22 out of 33 companies at March, and we continued to do it for 19 out of 30 companies at September, even after taking into account the fall in equity markets during our second quarter.",801
18511,"2015m11","Simon showed you that we have taken value reductions as a result of multiples for assets such as AES, Etanco and Dynatect.",801
18511,"2015m11","On the other hand, we increased the multiple we used to value Basic-Fit to 10.",801
18511,"2015m11","5x post-discount.",801
18511,"2015m11","For those of you who were able to attend the Investor Day in June, you will have seen the ambition of this business.",801
18511,"2015m11","That is accelerating.",801
18511,"2015m11","And the new multiple reflects the growth potential of this business, as it invests to upgrade existing gyms and to build and acquire new ones.",801
18511,"2015m11","We made no change to the multiple we used to value Action, which remains at 3.",801
18511,"2015m11","5x post-discount.",801
18511,"2015m11","In the DCF category, the positive movement of GBP 28 million was driven by the good performance of Scandlines.",801
18511,"2015m11","In our view, that the competing fixed link is likely to be delayed by at least another year.",801
18511,"2015m11","Now this good momentum, particularly over the last 12 months, flows through to the accrual for carry payable.",801
18511,"2015m11","And more schemes are forecast to meet the performance hurdles if you assume we sold everything at its current value.",801
18511,"2015m11","We expect to accrue carry at between 10% to 15% of Private Equity gross investment return, but we only pay out when the hurdle is met with cash returns.",801
18511,"2015m11","To give you the specific number, we paid out GBP 13 million in the first half.",801
18511,"2015m11","There is a negative receivable balance in this half, and this is a one-off accounting adjustment to the growth capital fund accrual, which went through its hurdle for the first time last year.",801
18511,"2015m11","As well as generating good value growth and realizations, the Private Equity business makes an important contribution to our operating cash profit.",801
18511,"2015m11","We confirmed in May that we have no plans in the short to medium term to raise a new third-party fund for Private Equity investment.",801
18511,"2015m11","This makes a lot of sense from a shareholder return perspective.",801
18511,"2015m11","But it means that the Private Equity fee income will continue to decline as we sell investments from our third-party funds, such as Eurofund V.",801
18511,"2015m11","However, the Private Equity portfolio itself generates income and made a strong contribution of GBP 22 million to operating cash income.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our Infrastructure business has also made a good contribution to group performance in the first half.",801
18511,"2015m11","The team's increased investments activity has demonstrated that they are able to deploy of funds well in a highly attractive sector.",801
18511,"2015m11","And that has been well received by 3iN's investors.",801
18511,"2015m11","3iN generated a TSR of 7%, and we received an ordinary dividend of GBP 11 million.",801
18511,"2015m11","And that GBP 11 million is included in our operating cash profit.",801
18511,"2015m11","3iN also paid a special dividend in July following the completion of the sale of its investment in Eversholt Rail, and we have treated this GBP 51 million as realization proceeds.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our investments in the Indian Infrastructure Fund continued to be impacted by the weakness in the road and power sectors and the rupee.",801
18511,"2015m11","That has led to a value reduction of GBP 9 million, partly offsetting the good contribution from the European businesses.",801
18511,"2015m11","Debt Management had a busy 6 months, and AUM is now GBP 7.",801
18511,"2015m11","They closed new CLOs in Europe and the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","and launched their Global Income Fund.",801
18511,"2015m11","That vehicle uses the combined expertise of our European and U.",801
18511,"2015m11","Debt Management is primarily a fund management business, and it generated another GBP 17 million of fees and operating cash income of GBP 33 million for 3i.",801
18511,"2015m11","We do invest proprietary capital in Debt Management, principally for regulatory reasons to meet the skin in the game rules for CLO fundraising or to support a new product, such as the Global Income Fund.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our investment in CLO equity generates a good cash income for us.",801
18511,"2015m11","We received GBP 14 million in the first half.",801
18511,"2015m11","All else equal, we expect the CLO equity value to fall roughly in line with this GBP 14 million of distributions.",801
18511,"2015m11","But in our second quarter in particular, there was also some pullback in market sentiment and appetite, especially in the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","Together, the distributions and market volatility led to a total of GBP 18 million value reduction.",801
18511,"2015m11","I talked earlier about the importance of a sustainable operating platform and solid balance sheet in the value build for shareholders.",801
18511,"2015m11","You can see here the contribution all 3 businesses have made to our operating cash profit of GBP 17 million.",801
18511,"2015m11","Having transformed the cost base of the group since 2012, we remain disciplined on costs.",801
18511,"2015m11","In fact, costs have fallen to less than 1% of AUM in the first half.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have been recruiting selectively to support the growth of all 3 businesses, so our benchmark target of 1% is an important discipline to maintain.",801
18511,"2015m11","The balance sheet is strong.",801
18511,"2015m11","After paying GBP 133 million out as the final dividend in July, we closed the half with net debt of GBP 12 million.",801
18511,"2015m11","And we are well funded with GBP 1.",801
18511,"2015m11","2 billion of liquidity to support investments and shareholder distributions.",801
18511,"2015m11","That said, we expect to remain net sellers in this financial year, with realizations weighted towards the end of the second half.",801
18511,"2015m11","So against that background, we have declared an interim dividend of 6p today, which is just over 15% of realization proceeds and which is made up of 2.",801
18511,"2015m11","7p base dividend and a 3.",801
18511,"2015m11","3p additional.",801
18511,"2015m11","We expect to be paying at the 20% end of our dividend range again this year.",801
18511,"2015m11","And as Simon has talked about, we expect realizations to have a lumpier profile going forward, but we are confident enough in the outlook to confirm that we expect to pay a total dividend of at least 15p for the year.",801
18511,"2015m11","The results we are announcing today demonstrate good momentum across all 3 business lines.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our Private Equity portfolio delivered a solid performance, supported by good contributions from both Infrastructure and Debt Management to support our strong investment platform.",801
18511,"2015m11","As Simon has said, we cannot be immune to wider geopolitical and economic conditions, but the sound fundamentals of the group mean that we are well-positioned commercially and financially to be able to capitalize over time on attractive opportunities as they arise.",801
18511,"2015m11","So thank you, and we are now happy to move over to questions.",801
18511,"2015m11","Charles Murphy, Panmure.",801
18511,"2015m11","On the debt management side of your Proprietary Capital, how much of that is invested in CLO equity? Okay.",801
18511,"2015m11","But it must be already on a fairly high multiple relative to cost? Bill Barnard.",801
18511,"2015m11","I note you rather glossed over on Action, the point about management change.",801
18511,"2015m11","Should I read anything into the fact you've changed both the CEO and the CFO and there is a reference to the next leg of the strategic journey? And also, I also see that Action has probably taken its leverage down a turn.",801
18511,"2015m11","Might you be tempted to take that back up in the second half? It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",801
18511,"2015m11","Just 2 questions.",801
18511,"2015m11","The first is I was just interested in your comments you made about some of the business indicators you're seeing have been deteriorating given the macro, particularly in industrials, yet the investment you've made is just in the industrial companies.",801
18511,"2015m11","So I was just -- if you could just help us think through kind of some of the logic there? And then -- and given 80% of the portfolio is basically U.",801
18511,"2015m11","or Europe, how should we think about possible Brexit and implications for 3i? It's very sensitive because we assume 0 cash flow from that route once the tunnel is open.",801
18511,"2015m11","So for every year delay, it's a very considerable sum of money on top of the valuation.",801
18511,"2015m11","We think there's likely to be another formal pronouncement to the further delay in the coming months.",801
18511,"2015m11","There are significant budgeting issues.",801
18511,"2015m11","And the formal process that Germany has to go through to approve planning and give 2 years for appeals and various other things has not been properly factored into the Danish timetable apparently.",801
18511,"2015m11","Anything else? No, okay.",801
18511,"2015m11","Thanks, everyone, for coming.",801
18511,"2015m11","Appreciate it.",801
18511,"2015m11","We're a cornerstone investor in the new Global Fund, which is another big chunk of it.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean, it's worth just dwelling a bit on Debt Management.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have seen really quite choppy markets there, particularly in the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","actually, more so than Europe.",801
18511,"2015m11","But again, I think in line with 3i's current behaviors, we've encouraged the credit team there to really take care of any loans we're worried about and move them out of the portfolio as quickly.",801
18511,"2015m11","So we've been quite aggressive at addressing those problems so we don't have problems down the road and encouraging those teams to then build back value in loans where they see better promise going forward.",801
18511,"2015m11","So again, I think we're being a little ahead of the curve in heading off some of the problems that might come through that market in the States.",801
18511,"2015m11","And we have a relatively light exposure to oil and gas compared to most of the CLO issuers in the States.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's not a sector that we've ever liked and it's a big sector.",801
18511,"2015m11","Richard? How sensitive is the valuation of Scandlines to delays on the tunnel? I mean, you referred delays on the tunnel.",801
18511,"2015m11","Okay, I'm -- let me respond.",801
18511,"2015m11","On the industrials question, let me start from the point that we don't have any direct exposure to oil and gas, and we don't have any direct commodity exposure.",801
18511,"2015m11","So the blackest parts of the scene are not things that we are familiar with.",801
18511,"2015m11","Where we've seen impacts where companies either have customers who deal with those sectors or have contracts servicing those sectors such as JMJ, as I noted, but actually not many of our industrial groups serve the industrial market.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's quite a limited number.",801
18511,"2015m11","And if you take Weener, for instance, it serves the consumer market.",801
18511,"2015m11","So it's not seeing the same sorts of pressures as a Dynatect would be seeing in the States and serves that market.",801
18511,"2015m11","So when I think you think about industrial sectors, you need to look at the end markets that those companies serve in order to come to a proper view.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean, the other thing I would say to balance this is that our consumer portfolio, in particular, is trading really very strongly and the consumer sector looks very different to the narrow industrial sector that we have concerns about.",801
18511,"2015m11","The other business we bought, Euro-Diesel, it basically makes these diesel engines to deal with supply -- power supply problems for data centers.",801
18511,"2015m11","The growth in data centers around the world is phenomenal and it hasn't affected that business at all, any of these industrial stuff.",801
18511,"2015m11","So they're out with the issues I'm talking about on the industrial sector.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean, on the Brexit question, frankly, I don't know what it means.",801
18511,"2015m11","I don't know how serious this will be for a lot of companies.",801
18511,"2015m11","We don't really have a huge number of U.",801
18511,"2015m11","companies that export large amounts to the rest of Europe.",801
18511,"2015m11","So in that sense, I think the issue is quite narrow for us.",801
18511,"2015m11","I don't think it will affect at all where we invest or how we work our business.",801
18511,"2015m11","So I'm not convinced if the vote went one way or the other, it would make a huge difference to 3i's portfolio or the returns.",801
18511,"2015m11","Charles Murphy, Panmure.",801
18511,"2015m11","On the debt management side of your Proprietary Capital, how much of that is invested in CLO equity? Yes.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean, both the companies in Brazil are consumer companies, and they're trading relatively robust there actually.",801
18511,"2015m11","So they're not in the commodity sector, they're not in the industrial sector.",801
18511,"2015m11","So we haven't seen any dramatic drop in their performance.",801
18511,"2015m11","What's the issue in those countries is tending to be the exchange rate and so we've suffered on the depreciation in the exchange rate.",801
18511,"2015m11","In terms of China, we have really limited exposure.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have a large reinsurance business based out of Singapore.",801
18511,"2015m11","We listed a company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, a sort of Chinese version of Carphone Warehouse, volatile markets, but no discernible pattern.",801
18511,"2015m11","And again, that business is a consumer business.",801
18511,"2015m11","And the reinsurance business is a very unique business, pretty unique amongst the private equity world, I think.",801
18511,"2015m11","Thank you, Simon.",801
18511,"2015m11","So another half year of solid performance with all 3 of our businesses making important progress, and it's another set of results which give you the evidence of how 3i is a business with the sound fundamentals it takes to perform well against a difficult economic and political backdrop.",801
18511,"2015m11","We are continuing to build value for our shareholders through strong development of earnings growth in the Private Equity portfolio.",801
18511,"2015m11","Constructive markets, particularly in the first quarter, led to realizations of GBP 359 million and further progress on reshaping the Private Equity portfolio.",801
18511,"2015m11","We remain focused on our operating cash profitability.",801
18511,"2015m11","That way, we can make sure we have a sustainable and sound operating platform.",801
18511,"2015m11","And all of this is supported by maintaining a strong balance sheet so that our investment teams can invest well at sensible prices and to support enhanced distributions to our investors.",801
18511,"2015m11","Now as you're all aware, this has been a volatile 6 months and this slide shows you how our NAV per share developed over the 2 quarters to the 30th of September.",801
18511,"2015m11","You can see that our Proprietary Capital made a strong contribution to NAV, both through realized profits and through value growth.",801
18511,"2015m11","Material intra-period swings on FX more or less canceled each other out over the 6 months.",801
18511,"2015m11","And after the payment of the final dividend of 14p in July, NAV pence per share was 401p at the 30th of September.",801
18511,"2015m11","So we delivered a total return of 4.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have said that all 3 businesses made important progress in the period.",801
18511,"2015m11","I'm now going to take you through the financial contribution each business made to our results.",801
18511,"2015m11","I'd like to start with Private Equity, which accounted for 81% of the Proprietary Capital portfolio at the end of September.",801
18511,"2015m11","Strong portfolio earnings growth supported gross investment return of GBP 246 million.",801
18511,"2015m11","The impact from multiple movements was lower than you might expect, given the fall in global equity markets in August and September, and I'll come on to talk about valuations in a minute.",801
18511,"2015m11","Realized profits of GBP 26 million came from the full disposals of 9 assets, the IPO of UFO, partial sales of Quintiles as well as the remittance of proceeds from Scandlines' January disposal of the H-H route.",801
18511,"2015m11","Together, these transactions generated GBP 307 million.",801
18511,"2015m11","The 9% uplift over value reflects the fact that a number of assets were held as imminent sale at the year-end, so we're talking about assets such as Azelis, Soyaconcept and Touchtunes.",801
18511,"2015m11","Simon described our increased focus on our stronger assets and new investments, and that is reflected in the strength of the portfolio earnings growth, which you can see here.",801
18511,"2015m11","As you can see, a very small proportion of value is made up of companies with falling earnings.",801
18511,"2015m11","And although Action remains an important contributor to the 19% profile, the growth, excluding Action, remains a healthy 14%.",801
18511,"2015m11","That, together with movements on net debt, is what led to the strong performance of GBP 171 million in portfolio value growth on this slide.",801
18511,"2015m11","We valued 30 companies on an earnings basis at the 30th of September.",801
18511,"2015m11","As usual, we used the last 12 months' earnings to the 30th of June, unless the most recent forecast to December 2015 showed a decline in performance.",801
18511,"2015m11","Five out of the 30 companies have been valued on a forecast earnings basis as a result of macroeconomic factors such as oil and gas sector exposure and currency volatility.",801
18511,"2015m11","The negative multiple movement of GBP 24 million reflects the deterioration in equity markets in August and September.",801
18511,"2015m11","As I've talked about for some time, we have adjusted down the multiples we use in our valuations when we think the multiple implied by the quoted comparables is ahead of our view of longer-term multiples and/or our exit expectations.",801
18511,"2015m11","We also consider the particular size and footprint of our investments.",801
18511,"2015m11","We did this for 22 out of 33 companies at March, and we continued to do it for 19 out of 30 companies at September, even after taking into account the fall in equity markets during our second quarter.",801
18511,"2015m11","Simon showed you that we have taken value reductions as a result of multiples for assets such as AES, Etanco and Dynatect.",801
18511,"2015m11","On the other hand, we increased the multiple we used to value Basic-Fit to 10.",801
18511,"2015m11","5x post-discount.",801
18511,"2015m11","For those of you who were able to attend the Investor Day in June, you will have seen the ambition of this business.",801
18511,"2015m11","That is accelerating.",801
18511,"2015m11","And the new multiple reflects the growth potential of this business, as it invests to upgrade existing gyms and to build and acquire new ones.",801
18511,"2015m11","We made no change to the multiple we used to value Action, which remains at 3.",801
18511,"2015m11","5x post-discount.",801
18511,"2015m11","In the DCF category, the positive movement of GBP 28 million was driven by the good performance of Scandlines, and our view that the competing fixed link is likely to be delayed by at least another year.",801
18511,"2015m11","Now this good momentum, particularly over the last 12 months, flows through to the accrual for carry payable.",801
18511,"2015m11","And more schemes are forecast to meet the performance hurdles if you assume we sold everything at its current value.",801
18511,"2015m11","We expect to accrue carry at between 10% to 15% of Private Equity gross investment return, but we only pay out when the hurdle is met with cash returns.",801
18511,"2015m11","To give you the specific number, we paid out GBP 13 million in the first half.",801
18511,"2015m11","There is a negative receivable balance in this half, and this is a one-off accounting adjustment to the growth capital fund accrual, which went through its hurdle for the first time last year.",801
18511,"2015m11","As well as generating good value growth and realizations, the Private Equity business makes an important contribution to our operating cash profit.",801
18511,"2015m11","We confirmed in May that we have no plans in the short to medium term to raise a new third-party fund for Private Equity investment.",801
18511,"2015m11","This makes a lot of sense from a shareholder return perspective.",801
18511,"2015m11","But it means that the Private Equity fee income will continue to decline as we sell investments from our third-party funds, such as Eurofund V.",801
18511,"2015m11","However, the Private Equity portfolio itself generates income and made a strong contribution of GBP 22 million to operating cash income.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our Infrastructure business has also made a good contribution to group performance in the first half.",801
18511,"2015m11","The team's increased investments activity has demonstrated that they are able to deploy funds well in a highly attractive sector.",801
18511,"2015m11","And that has been well received by 3iN's investors.",801
18511,"2015m11","3iN generated a TSR of 7%, and we received an ordinary dividend of GBP 11 million.",801
18511,"2015m11","And that GBP 11 million is included in our operating cash profit.",801
18511,"2015m11","3iN also paid a special dividend in July following the completion of the sale of its investment in Eversholt Rail, and we have treated this GBP 51 million as realization proceeds.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our investments in the Indian Infrastructure Fund continued to be impacted by the weakness in the road and power sectors and the rupee.",801
18511,"2015m11","That has led to a value reduction of GBP 9 million, partly offsetting the good contribution from the European businesses.",801
18511,"2015m11","Debt Management had a busy 6 months, and AUM is now GBP 7.",801
18511,"2015m11","They closed new CLOs in Europe and the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","and launched their Global Income Fund.",801
18511,"2015m11","That vehicle uses the combined expertise of our European and U.",801
18511,"2015m11","Debt Management is principally a fund management business, and it generated another GBP 17 million of fees and operating cash income of GBP 33 million for 3i.",801
18511,"2015m11","We do invest proprietary capital in Debt Management, principally for regulatory reasons to meet the skin in the game rules for CLO fundraising or to support a new product, such as the Global Income Fund.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our investment in CLO equity generates a good cash income for us.",801
18511,"2015m11","We received GBP 14 million in the first half.",801
18511,"2015m11","All else equal, we expect the CLO equity value to fall roughly in line with this GBP 14 million of distributions.",801
18511,"2015m11","But in our second quarter in particular, there was also some pullback in market sentiment and appetite, especially in the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","Together, the distributions and market volatility led to a total GBP 18 million value reduction.",801
18511,"2015m11","I talked earlier about the importance of a sustainable operating platform and solid balance sheet in the value build for shareholders.",801
18511,"2015m11","You can see here the contribution all 3 businesses have made to our operating cash profit of GBP 17 million.",801
18511,"2015m11","Having transformed the cost base of the group since 2012, we remain disciplined on costs.",801
18511,"2015m11","In fact, costs have fallen to less than 1% of AUM in the first half.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have been recruiting selectively to support the growth of all 3 businesses, so our benchmark target of 1% is an important discipline to maintain.",801
18511,"2015m11","The balance sheet is strong.",801
18511,"2015m11","After paying GBP 133 million out as the final dividend in July, we closed the half with net debt of GBP 12 million.",801
18511,"2015m11","And we are well funded with GBP 1.",801
18511,"2015m11","2 billion of liquidity to support investments and shareholder distributions.",801
18511,"2015m11","That said, we expect to remain net sellers in this financial year, with realizations weighted towards the end of the second half.",801
18511,"2015m11","So against that background, we have declared an interim dividend of 6p today, which is just over 15% of realization proceeds and which is made up of 2.",801
18511,"2015m11","7p base dividend and a 3.",801
18511,"2015m11","3p additional.",801
18511,"2015m11","We expect to be paying at the 20% end of our dividend range again this year.",801
18511,"2015m11","And as Simon has talked about, we expect realizations to have a lumpier profile going forward, but we are confident enough in the outlook to confirm that we expect to pay a total dividend of at least 15p for the year.",801
18511,"2015m11","The results we are announcing today demonstrate good momentum across all 3 business lines.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our Private Equity portfolio delivered a solid performance, supported by good contributions from both Infrastructure and Debt Management to support our strong investment platform.",801
18511,"2015m11","As Simon has said, we cannot be immune to wider geopolitical and economic conditions, but the sound fundamentals of the group mean that we are well-positioned commercially and financially to be able to capitalize over time on attractive opportunities as they arise.",801
18511,"2015m11","So thank you, and we are now happy to move over to questions.",801
18511,"2015m11","Bill Barnard.",801
18511,"2015m11","I note you rather glossed over on Action, the point about management change.",801
18511,"2015m11","Should I read anything into the fact you've changed both the CEO and the CFO and there is a reference to the next leg of the strategic journey? And also, I also see that Action has probably taken its leverage down a turn.",801
18511,"2015m11","Might you be tempted to tick that back up in the second half? Okay.",801
18511,"2015m11","Just to follow up quickly, and then on the debt management side, would there be any implication, for example, domicile of the fund manager or anything like that? Why don't you take one? Bill? Simon, sorry, it's Iain Scouller from Stifel.",801
18511,"2015m11","Simon, I note the bullish comments on bucket 1.",801
18511,"2015m11","What multiple is bucket 1 valued at, at the end of September? It's very sensitive because we assume 0 cash flow from that route once the tunnel is open.",801
18511,"2015m11","So for every year delay, it's a very considerable sum of money on top of the valuation.",801
18511,"2015m11","We think there's likely to be another formal pronouncement of a further delay in the coming months.",801
18511,"2015m11","There are significant budgeting issues.",801
18511,"2015m11","And the formal process that Germany has to go through to approve planning and give 2 years for appeals and various other things has not been properly factored into the Danish timetable apparently.",801
18511,"2015m11","We don't actually tell you all of the companies that are in each bucket.",801
18511,"2015m11","Let me deal with both of those.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean, we had some important discussions about the development of Action and the management succession question in the first half of this year, and that really led to the CEO change that we've announced.",801
18511,"2015m11","And essentially, we wanted a commitment from management for at least 4 or 5 years because we do see a likely realization event probably calendar '17, something like that.",801
18511,"2015m11","That could be an IPO or it could be something else, but that is a sort of broad target.",801
18511,"2015m11","And if we're IPO-ing it, we want to make sure the team are in place for a good period after that.",801
18511,"2015m11","And Ronald has done a fantastic job at Action, and he is an incredibly energetic and effective CEO, but he was not prepared to commit to that timescale, so we agreed with him that, as we were entering a critical phase for preparing the company for that type of event, it would be better to make a change sooner rather than later.",801
18511,"2015m11","So Sander van der Laan who's come out of Ahold.",801
18511,"2015m11","He actually comes from the same part of Holland where Action comes from, so he's part of that Northern Dutch community.",801
18511,"2015m11","He's incredibly familiar with the business.",801
18511,"2015m11","He's been pretty envious of the growth that he's witnessed at Action and what it did to the Albert Heijn business, which he ran for a number of years at Ahold.",801
18511,"2015m11","He's a very effective individual.",801
18511,"2015m11","He's used to running a big company.",801
18511,"2015m11","He's ran businesses for Ahold in the States as well.",801
18511,"2015m11","We interviewed quite a number of candidates for this, and he was by far the best and most suitable candidate.",801
18511,"2015m11","So we're delighted to get him.",801
18511,"2015m11","He has spent the last 3 months looking at the different countries, looking at competition and getting briefed on the business.",801
18511,"2015m11","And he formally takes over the reins at the beginning of January.",801
18511,"2015m11","Frederik came in as CFO late summer.",801
18511,"2015m11","He was actually recruited last year, but it took time to disconnect him from Arla where he'd been CFO.",801
18511,"2015m11","He's another very effective international executive, worked very effectively on the Arla board, superb references, and he's already doing a great job.",801
18511,"2015m11","So we have a management team in place that can see us through a big event and they're both guys who've got big company experience.",801
18511,"2015m11","And Action is becoming a very big company.",801
18511,"2015m11","In terms of leverage, it's become a bit of a tradition that we do a refied action every 12 months or so.",801
18511,"2015m11","The gearing is already back below 3x EBITDA, so that could well be on the cards, Bill.",801
18511,"2015m11","It creates cash more than 100% of its earnings, so it's a very cash-generative business.",801
18511,"2015m11","Iain? How sensitive is the valuation of Scandlines to delays on the tunnel? I mean, you referred delays on the tunnel.",801
18511,"2015m11","Who knows? I think regulations are changing so quickly.",801
18511,"2015m11","There could be something comes out that may present issues.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have a U.",801
18511,"2015m11","capability.",801
18511,"2015m11","Obviously, we have a European capability.",801
18511,"2015m11","But there's nothing on the horizon that we're aware of immediately that would need to change the domicile of that business.",801
18511,"2015m11","Chip? Charles Cade from Numis.",801
18511,"2015m11","You talked about 14% earnings growth, excluding Action, but including portfolio acquisitions, can you give any sort of idea how much portfolio acquisitions contributed to that? Yes.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's about 1% this time.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's about 2% at March.",801
18511,"2015m11","I don't think we break out an average across the buckets, I'm afraid.",801
18511,"2015m11","We're a cornerstone investor in the new Global Fund, which is another big chunk of it.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean, it's worth just dwelling a bit on Debt Management.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have seen really quite choppy markets there, particularly in the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","actually, more so than Europe.",801
18511,"2015m11","But again, I think in line with 3i's current behaviors, we've encouraged the credit team there to really take care of any loans we're worried about and move them out of the portfolios quickly.",801
18511,"2015m11","So we've been quite aggressive at addressing those problems so we don't have problems down the road and encouraging those teams to then build back value in loans where they see better promise going forward.",801
18511,"2015m11","So again, I think we're being a little ahead of the curve in heading off some of the problems that might come through that market in the States.",801
18511,"2015m11","And we have a relatively light exposure to oil and gas compared to most of the CLO issuers in the States.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's not a sector that we've ever liked and it's a big sector.",801
18511,"2015m11","Richard? Okay, good morning, everyone.",801
18511,"2015m11","Welcome to 3i's Interim Results.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our goal at 3i remains to deliver attractive proprietary profits from a cost-efficient investment platform.",801
18511,"2015m11","And we've had a solid first half, with all 3 of our business lines making important progress against their plans.",801
18511,"2015m11","Despite the volatility in the markets up until the end of September, we've seen a robust performance from our portfolio of proprietary investments.",801
18511,"2015m11","We've also delivered on our realization plan for the first half, and we made some new investments in Private Equity and Infrastructure.",801
18511,"2015m11","Importantly, we're continuing to make strong progress on our fundamentals, the health of our Proprietary Capital portfolio and the group's financial model.",801
18511,"2015m11","The group KPIs continue to reflect the benefits of our restructuring in 2012.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our improved cash operating profit is underpinned by a resilient NAV performance and a strong balance sheet, and Julia will give you more detail on this shortly.",801
18511,"2015m11","And as I have just said, our goal remains to deliver attractive proprietary profits from a cost-efficient platform.",801
18511,"2015m11","That way, our shareholders will benefit from strong capital gains and significant cash distributions.",801
18511,"2015m11","The main driver of our capital profits is our Private Equity business, where we target international mid-market investments.",801
18511,"2015m11","Our objective is to make at least 2x our money over a 4-year investment period.",801
18511,"2015m11","Once again, our Private Equity team has delivered.",801
18511,"2015m11","They've achieved a solid portfolio performance, a good level of realizations from the challenged end of our portfolio and 2 new and 1 follow-on investment, all made at sensible prices.",801
18511,"2015m11","We've continued to reshape our Private Equity portfolio by selling assets from our weaker or non-core buckets and devoting more energy and resources to our better investments.",801
18511,"2015m11","The majority of these realizations were completed early in the first half when conditions were more supportive of selling companies that either had issues or a checkered record.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have a number of important realization and refinancing initiatives running in the second half, but in the main, these include some of our stronger companies.",801
18511,"2015m11","A number of the companies we sold, such as Azelis and Labco, have required intense management focus over the last few years.",801
18511,"2015m11","But the time has been well spent, and we've built back significant value ahead of their sales.",801
18511,"2015m11","Azelis and Inspecta represent our contrasting approaches to problem assets.",801
18511,"2015m11","Along with Labco, these were '07, '08 vintage assets.",801
18511,"2015m11","In the case of Azelis, the Investment Committee were very supportive of the new Chairman and CEO we put in place, and we backed their turnaround plan with funding support.",801
18511,"2015m11","This was not the case with Inspecta, where we came to the view that further funding would not be in the interest of 3i's shareholders or our LPs.",801
18511,"2015m11","As a result of our focus on rebuilding and realizing value in the bucket 3 assets, we're beginning to see a marked change in the makeup of our Private Equity portfolio.",801
18511,"2015m11","We're now down to 53 companies and 5 listed holdings from over 120 in 2012.",801
18511,"2015m11","90% of the portfolio value now resides in our keepers in bucket 1, our strong performers in bucket 2 or our remaining listed stakes.",801
18511,"2015m11","And just to remind you of the definitions, while bucket 2 is our target of 2x, in bucket 1, we are expecting to do materially better than 2x.",801
18511,"2015m11","And the quality of our current portfolio is reflected in the weighted average earnings growth of 19% in the period or 14% if we exclude Action.",801
18511,"2015m11","We've had a few situations where earnings have suffered in the current environment, such as Dynatect or JMJ.",801
18511,"2015m11","Both of these businesses have suffered indirect blows from oil -- the oil and gas situation.",801
18511,"2015m11","But in the main, markdowns have come about as a result of valuation changes in specific sectors.",801
18511,"2015m11","And earnings uplifts in the portfolio have far outweighed any negative multiple adjustments.",801
18511,"2015m11","And at 3i today, just because a company suffers a markdown, that doesn't mean it's a bad business.",801
18511,"2015m11","I'd also like to say just a few words on Action, where I joined the board in March.",801
18511,"2015m11","Action goes from strength to strength, with over 80 new stores opened so far this year, with the majority of those stores being in France and Germany.",801
18511,"2015m11","The new stores in all countries are performing very well and like-for-likes across the entire store portfolio remain strong.",801
18511,"2015m11","There is plenty of activity planned in the last few months of the year with significant further openings in November and December and the opening of Action's third distribution center near Paris early in the new year.",801
18511,"2015m11","Personally, I've been most struck by the energy of the company and the laser-like focus on very low prices and how the exact same store format works in every country Action enters.",801
18511,"2015m11","And to cap it all off, Action has just won Retailer of the Year for the second year in a row in Holland amongst its peers.",801
18511,"2015m11","Scandlines, another of our large keeper assets, is having a good year with strong earnings momentum and excellent cash flow.",801
18511,"2015m11","It should also benefit from even further delays, which are now expected on the competing fixed link, Rødby-Puttgarden route.",801
18511,"2015m11","Let me say a little more about JMJ.",801
18511,"2015m11","We acquired JMJ a couple of years ago, well before the oil price collapse.",801
18511,"2015m11","JMJ has seen projects canceled or downsized in its core oil and gas sector as a result of that price drop.",801
18511,"2015m11","But they've responded very effectively by initiating a cost reduction program across the entire firm and by focusing new business activity outside of the oil and gas sector.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's absolutely clear to us that the trading environment is becoming more difficult in a number of industrial sectors.",801
18511,"2015m11","And through our monthly dashboard monitoring process, we are very focused on supporting our management teams where they have exposure to slowing sectors or geographies or where they face other factors which are outside their control.",801
18511,"2015m11","The Private Equity team has also been busy with new investments this year, including the purchase of Weener, a long-established German business we acquired this summer.",801
18511,"2015m11","We see Weener as a platform asset where we have a very real opportunity to grow both organically and through M&A, playing to our strengths in the international mid-market.",801
18511,"2015m11","The infrastructure team has been very busy.",801
18511,"2015m11","They have developed a new strategy in order to broaden their investment mandate beyond the large super core sector.",801
18511,"2015m11","They've backed their new approach with GBP 187 million of new investments in the first half as well as some capable new recruits to broaden out their origination capability without losing any of their first-class asset management performance.",801
18511,"2015m11","And last, but not least, the excellent result on Eversholt financed the GBP 51 million special dividend we received from 3i Infrastructure this summer.",801
18511,"2015m11","During our first half, our debt management team has continued to perform well in more challenging markets.",801
18511,"2015m11","They've been productive in both the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","and Europe.",801
18511,"2015m11","And new CLOs as well as -- with new CLOs as well as launching a Global Income Fund and raising further investments for the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","Senior Loan Fund and the European Middle Market Fund.",801
18511,"2015m11","And once again, the division has made a very good contribution, income contribution, with GBP 17 million of fee income in the first half as well as GBP 14 million of CLO distributions.",801
18511,"2015m11","Now I wanted to show you this slide again, updated for September's end.",801
18511,"2015m11","It highlights well just what an efficient machine 3i has become and bodes very well for when we come to realize some of our largest investments.",801
18511,"2015m11","Operating and interest costs are now accounting for less than 15% of our annual cash flows compared to almost 70% over the period covering financial years '10, '11 and '12, leaving the bulk of our cash flows available for new investment and shareholder distributions.",801
18511,"2015m11","So it's been another decent 6 months for 3i in spite of the challenging macro picture, the volatile markets and the low point of the 30th of September.",801
18511,"2015m11","The fundamentals, our proprietary investment portfolio and the group's financial model have continued to strengthen, and each of our 3 divisions is performing well relative to their peers.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have clear strategic priorities, and we're making real progress on all of them.",801
18511,"2015m11","And importantly, we have a strong balance sheet and a high quality portfolio just as the cycle is turning more difficult.",801
18511,"2015m11","Over time, the silver lining of this change in investment climate will, of course, be more opportunities on the buy side.",801
18511,"2015m11","We understand the changes in the cycle and the challenges that will bring, and the ongoing need for us to maintain our price discipline in particular, but we welcome the opportunities it will create now that we've put our own house in order.",801
18511,"2015m11","I'd like to pass over to Julia for the remainder.",801
18511,"2015m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",801
18511,"2015m11","Simon, I note you've got about 1% of the portfolio in Brazil, 6% in Asia.",801
18511,"2015m11","Can you talk about a little bit about how events in those emerging markets have affected companies in those areas? It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",801
18511,"2015m11","Just 2 questions.",801
18511,"2015m11","The first is I was just interested in your comments you made about some of the business indicators you're seeing have been deteriorating given the macro, particularly in industrials, yet the investment you've made is just in the industrial companies.",801
18511,"2015m11","So I was just -- if you could just help us think through kind of some of the logic there? And then -- and given 80% of the portfolio is basically U.",801
18511,"2015m11","or Europe, how should we think about possible Brexit and implications for 3i? Yes.",801
18511,"2015m11","So the CLO equity at the end of the year was -- at the end of the period was GBP 51 million that we've done.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have about GBP 130 million in total.",801
18511,"2015m11","But it must be already on a fairly high multiple relative to cost? Okay, I'm -- let me respond.",801
18511,"2015m11","On the industrials question, let me start from the point that we don't have any direct exposure to oil and gas, and we don't have any direct commodity exposure.",801
18511,"2015m11","So the blackest parts of the scene are not things that we are familiar with.",801
18511,"2015m11","Where we've seen impacts are where companies either have customers who deal with those sectors or have contracts servicing those sectors such as JMJ, as I noted, but actually not many of our industrial groups serve the industrial market.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's quite a limited number.",801
18511,"2015m11","And if you take Weener, for instance, it serves the consumer market.",801
18511,"2015m11","So it's not seeing the same sorts of pressures as a Dynatect would be seeing in the States and serves that market.",801
18511,"2015m11","So when I think you think about industrial sectors, you need to look at the end markets that those companies serve in order to come to a proper view.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean, the other thing I would say to balance this is that our consumer portfolio, in particular, is trading really very strongly and the consumer sector looks very different to the narrow industrial sector that we have concerns about.",801
18511,"2015m11","The other business we bought, Euro-Diesel, it basically makes these diesel engines to deal with supply -- power supply problems for data centers.",801
18511,"2015m11","The growth in data centers around the world is phenomenal and it hasn't affected that business at all, any of this industrial stuff.",801
18511,"2015m11","So they're out with the issues I'm talking about on the industrial sector.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean, on the Brexit question, frankly, I don't know what it means.",801
18511,"2015m11","I don't know how serious this will be for a lot of companies.",801
18511,"2015m11","We don't really have a huge number of U.",801
18511,"2015m11","companies that export large amounts to the rest of Europe.",801
18511,"2015m11","So in that sense, I think the issue is quite narrow for us.",801
18511,"2015m11","I don't think it will affect at all where we invest or how we work our business.",801
18511,"2015m11","So I'm not convinced if the vote went one way or the other, it would make a huge difference to 3i's portfolio or the returns.",801
18511,"2015m11","Anything else? No, okay.",801
18511,"2015m11","Thanks, everyone, for coming.",801
18511,"2015m11","Appreciate it.",801
18511,"2015m11","I don't think so.",801
18511,"2015m11","I think the multiple, it's heavily skewed by Action.",801
18511,"2015m11","We have 1 or 2 other businesses like -- long-established business like Element, which were on aggressive multiples given the sectors they come from.",801
18511,"2015m11","So I don't think we're too far away from the average that you see there without Action really across the buckets.",801
18511,"2015m11","I mean, the one multiple we did change positively was Basic-Fit.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's growing really well.",801
18511,"2015m11","It's investing a lot in gyms.",801
18511,"2015m11","We saw Planet Fitness float in the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","on a 15x EBITDA multiple.",801
18511,"2015m11","We saw The Gym Group float, I think, this week on an even higher multiple in the U.",801
18511,"2015m11","So we've stuck our neck out and put it at 10.",801
18511,"2015m5","Let me have a go.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, in terms of the earnings growth, I think this really splits down.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So ultimately, it's the management of these businesses, that really determine the strength of the earnings growth, whether it be an Azelis or whether it be an Action.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But the 3i teams are very knowledgeable and engaged shareholders, so they can be very good at prompting change and also, making judgments that use our other experiences in the past or across the portfolio to help management tackle market challenges.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And in particular, our own style is to help businesses internationalize.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And again, we have a lot of experience in internationalizing these mid-sized companies and bringing contacts and other benefits to those management.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the fundamental driver, particularly of the better company, is down, I would say, in the main to them being good companies and interesting sectors with strong management teams, and a very engaged shareholder.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've been more hands-on and more active in the problem companies, where we've seen a very significant turnaround from negative earnings momentum to some cases, really quite positive earnings momentum.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that's involved a great deal of time from the 3i executives involved in them.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, is it sustainable? I suppose what we have seen a broadly is a pickup in confidence and the overall environment over the last 6 months, in particular, really since the European Central Bank started signaling that QB was going to be the order of the day.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So that was quite noticeable across much of the portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I think the better companies will continue to prosper.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Fortunately, for us, the better company is now dominate the value of the portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we're anticipating another healthy year coming out of this portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We don't see any dramatic change or anything like that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The last point was the investment point? Okay.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Well, maybe Julia can take the second question, I'll deal with the first.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think we come out of auctions pretty well, if the clearing price in the auction is a sensible price.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So both American assets and Aspen Pumps were auctions, they were quite narrow auctions.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And ultimately, once the price got to a certain point, the influence of management, included rather travel with going forward, becomes very important.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I think our team do a really good job at getting alongside management, and convincing them that the approach of 3i and the longer-term perspective that we have about investing, is a very good place for them to join, if you like.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So all 3 of those businesses were in auctions.",1446
18511,"2015m5","All 3 of those business, we bought at prices we're very comfortable with.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But in the end, it came down to choices of the management, astutely they chose, and they chose us.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I think that's the sort of performance we like to see when we're in an auction process.",1446
18511,"2015m5","If it's just about price, and as I said, there is a hurdle or 2 in there, that we're not going to play in that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think, Chris, on the other hand, we had very good insights into that business because of Amor.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So although that may have been dressed up as an auction, it was pretty clear to us we had a very powerful position and we were able to lock that investment done, pretty early in the process.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's Haley Tam from Citigroup.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Two questions, please.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Firstly, you have mentioned the very buoyant realization environment, and we can see that buckets 2, 3 and 4 fallen from over [ph] 60% of our portfolio to just 30% at the end of March '15 [ph].",1446
18511,"2015m5","Would you discourage me from thinking about that going to 0 by the end of the year, and if so, why? And I guess, the follow-up question would be, in relation to that, your dividend policy in the medium-term, how should I think about that? Should that continued progress realizations or is there any chance that should shift from our cash flow basis? Okay.",1446
18511,"2015m5","There are some mics at the back.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I'll bring them up to.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Philip? I think we'd like to be up to EUR 750 million-type of new investment.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's where would like to be out of Proprietary Capital.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we can see that very easily.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But I'll just repeat, we're not going to go there, if it means opening the filters 1 iota.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we'll only go there if we are completely comfortable with the price.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Yes? Just a couple, 1 sort of, I guess, following on from Philip's question is, I guess, no process is purely proprietary.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So where you do have to compete in auctions, i.",1446
18511,"2015m5","paying the top price, or are you able to bring some kind of edge into play, you have a network, your experience in internationalizing businesses, et cetera? And just on Action, increasing it by a turn, was that you're decision, or was that taken discussions, I guess, with the auditors, given your previous comments on the valuation of that asset? Okay.",1446
18511,"2015m5","On the realizations, I'd love to think it would -- well, particularly, the bottom 2 buckets get a 0, but I think that's unlikely.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think we're always going to have it rank back around at the bottom.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But it'll be de minimis, in terms of value, ultimately.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So it won't be, in any way, a real driver or a drag on the growth coming out of our portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I would expect to see this trend continue quite strongly over the next couple of years, even if it doesn't guide get to 0.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And in terms of dividend policy, maybe, I'll make a comment, and then Julia can pick this up.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I would say we gave you guidance back in 2012, '13 to reassure shareholders that we were going to be providing meaningful cash dividends going forward, the 15% to 20% of realizations.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that's what we've used.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's been a guidance for that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But if you look at 3i today, I think it is a strong cash machine going forward.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So whether we're a slave to that original dividend guidance, or whether we tipped slightly over it, as we did today, I think these are nicer problems to have that will just as we come to it.",1446
18511,"2015m5","[indiscernible] Yes, I think that's right.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've -- in terms of modeling, you should keep using the guidance that we've given, but we've shown ourselves to be practical in the cage once we've gone through our criteria article in the we would applied it both last year and this year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So -- but for now, I would continue to use the 15% -- 15% to 20% when you're modeling, and 20%, which is what we said, when investment levels are below where would like to be.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Bill? And then on the decision to change the multiple on Action, I mean, it will surprise you to know that there's a fair amount of potential journey or the audit process and the valuation of the process of the valuation of Action.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But I'd say, there were sort of a number of drivers.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've had another year of strong performance of Action under our ownership, so the confidence in these store rollouts, the use of the run rate earnings, was reinforced for us.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I think actually, we've been able to develop a more relevant concept than we had when we first invested in the asset, when really, we were only able to look at more mature U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","discounters, and then some local retailers with the listings of other European and U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","-based discounters, that has allowed us to actually develop a concept which is more relevant.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I think having an eye to that, was also important.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think we still think that there's plenty to do in developing the value of Action.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Philip Middleton, from Merrill Lynch.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Obviously, these are fantastic result, which well done.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just a couple of questions arising out of those.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Firstly, you talked about the investment pipeline.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Could you tell us a bit more about what you're seeing in terms of valuation there, and in a particular, are there any geographical distinctions or any sectoral distinctions, is there any areas where you feel you've got the particular edge that's enabling you to compete because presumably, will be key in the next year or 2? Secondly, on the balance sheet, I can't entirely understand why you're backing away from the balance sheet structure you had in certain other areas.",1446
18511,"2015m5","0% is a bit off, is slightly conservative, when you look at where -- for example, into immediate capital is doing, when you look at what some of the other comp side vendor are also doing, I just wondered what modeling you've done to determine that 0% is a good number? Okay, I'll take the first.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I'll make 1 comment about the second, but Julia will, no doubt, want to talk about that as well.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, in terms of the investment pipeline, the wheat, as we call it, is pretty busy.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It is reflecting opportunities across our key geographies of North America and Northern Europe.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's very much in those sectors that we like.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It is big and it's terms of range of size, so I would think it varies between equity checks of GBP 50 million and GBP 175 million, in terms of size of potential investments from our point of view.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And clearly, some of those processes are what I would call more proprietorial than general, and where we find ourselves for 1 reason or another, in the more  proprietorial process, it obviously ultimately, leads to better pricing dynamic, I would say.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In general, if it's a very competitive process, we're careful about how much money we spend on due diligence before we get a better sense of where the pricing is going to be moved to.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I think this is one of these things where the crystal ball is very hard to say at the moment.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The good things are that the witness wide, there's lots to look at, ll the teams are more focused on origination than asset management because we have the portfolio, generally, n a much better shape, the existing portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But how many we pulled the trigger on ultimately, because of pricing, it's very hard for me to say today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But there are some coming to investment committee, which are obviously, we're very interested in.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I think the outlook for investment gradually improves, but it's always dependent on the market and whether there's some out there pay us a good price for that particular asset or not.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think on the balance sheet, what I would say, as the banker that helped dropped the 3i prospectus in 1994, we -- at that time, we have a Scottish CEOS at 3i, Ewan Macpherson, who is a very strong CEO of the business, and we debated aggressively about the capital structure.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we came to the very simple position that there was enough debt in the portfolio, we didn't need more in the center.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Because when the portfolio went the wrong way, we would need resources to support the portfolio because of the gearing in the portfolio, which averaged similar amounts of gearing to what we see today, so that was the wisdom.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that philosophically, I haven't moved a long way from that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think it holds as well today as it did then.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I'm not sure we want to travel with large amounts of cash, but having a degree of liquidity and little of our own debt to worry about, does put us in a very good position, to pull the trigger on helping our own companies in a down cycle or a shock, and actually, going after some very interesting investments should that happen.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I think should that happen, we're in a much better position to capitalize on that now.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Yes, that's fine.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Well, I talked -- I gave you the names of the ones that are in the imminent sale category, which is Azelis, Inspector, Touch Tunes and Sawyer, and they're effectively all more or less, all baked into the numbers, there's a small difference potentially on those.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that's roughly about GBP 130 million, and we expect to get in.",1446
18511,"2015m5","FX has not been my friend since the 31st of March, particularly post the election results.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the last time I looked at, that looked like another GBP 60 million, principally due -- well, both due to euro and dollar.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as I said, in the back of the pack, you'll see the 1% sensitivities that we've had on FX since the March balance sheet day.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Any other questions? Great, okay.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Thanks for coming today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Good to see all.",1446
18511,"2015m5","When we gave that guidance, we were coming from a position where the group had been seeing about GBP 100 million of operating cost leakage a year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the other big factor that's clearly changed is we're making an operating cash surplus out of the current business.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just wondering if you could give a guidance, on what's happened ever since that 31st [ph] of March, basically, in terms of sort of the amount of realizations that you've agreed that haven't yet completed, what the uplifts might be on there and the FX effect? Thank you, Simon.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So Simon has confirmed we have consistently met or exceeded the objectives we set for ourselves for the 3 years since 2012.",1446
18511,"2015m5","These results give you further evidence of the progress that we've made in building value for our shareholders.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Importantly, the results show how all 3 of our businesses are performing well.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just to be clear, I will, again, be referring to our investment basis numbers rather than our audited statutory results.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As usual, I've included reconciliation to the 2 sets of numbers in the pack.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The total return and NAV are the same under each basis.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our results show how we are building value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You can see the excellent performance from our portfolio of investments and the 19% increase in Private Equity portfolio earnings, which underpinned the GBP 684 million value growth.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We generated a good flow of realizations, delivering proceeds of GBP 841 million, and a money multiple of 2x.",1446
18511,"2015m5","When you exclude refinancings, the uplift over book value was 27%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have a significantly more robust and efficient platform, and our cash operating profit increased from GBP 5 million to GBP 28 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Fund Management business has delivered an underlying operating profit of GBP 33 million, and as Simon said, our balance sheet is sound, and we have funded GBP 474 million of total cash investments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The strength of realizations and the significant reduction in cash leakage from cost and interests, have allowed us to close the year with no gearing.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The model is working well.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that's why we have announced a total dividend for the year of 20p per share.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We closed the year with NAV per share of 396p, up 14% on last year, and a total return of 20%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's great results.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You can see on this slide the positive contribution that we've had from both value growth realized profits.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The impact of the reduction in our cost base and interest build, means that the dilution of those returns is significantly lower.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The net carry payable is a direct cost of the strong portfolio performance that we've delivered.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Currency was volatile throughout the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In the end, the net translation effects of a strong U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","dollar and a weaker euro to 12p of NAV.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I've given you the updated sensitivities and the breakdown of net assets by currency in the back of the pack, so you can continue to track these effects.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Finally, we paid 6p of our proposed 20p total dividend in January, together with last year's final dividend that results in the 19p that you can see here.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As you've seen, all 3 of our businesses contributed to the strong performance in the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our focus on the individual businesses first, before covering the group KPIs in further detail.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Private Equity has had a very good year, generating a gross investment return of GBP 719 [ph] million, and that's after FX, or 24% of opening portfolio value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've reduced the portfolio to 65 investments at the year end, right in line with our longer-term aim to reduce to less than 40 assets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And while the overall number of companies in the portfolio, reducing the overall number of companies in the portfolio, we've generated realized profits of GBP 144 million, and an uplift of 27% over opening value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we've reshaped the portfolio towards what we call our keeper assets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Of the GBP 830 million cash proceeds that we received from Private Equity, GBP 155 million was the result of our decision to take advantage of the favorable debt markets, to refinance some of our strongest and cash generative investments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Here, I'm talking about Action, Element and Amor.",1446
18511,"2015m5","When there is a refinancing, cash is usually returned to us by repayments of shareholder loans, which means, there's little or no uplift on those proceeds.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In total, we fully sold 19 assets, generating GBP 456 million of proceeds, as well as realizing good returns from investments such as Hilite, a 31% IRR and a 2.",1446
18511,"2015m5","1x money multiple; and Vedici, a 48% uplift and another 2x money multiple.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We also sold a 12 investments, which had an individual book values of less than GBP 5 million each, at the 31st of March 2014.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Bouyant Equity Markets, meant we were able to IPO 4 companies: Phibro in the U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","in April, diphone in China in July; they were followed by Eltel in Stockholm, and Refresco in Amsterdam towards the end of the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We completely sold down our investments in Phibro during the year, and we realized GBP 273 million in proceeds from IPOs and quota sales.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as at the 31st of March 2015, our quota portfolio had a closing value of GBP 273 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Realizations and our cash to cash returns are the ultimate measure of our success.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But in the meantime, the value growth in our portfolio gives you evidence of the progress that we are making.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Value-weighted earnings growth was 19% for the 33 companies that we value on an earnings basis.",1446
18511,"2015m5","By comparison, that measure was 9% 3 years ago.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And although the 19% and the 9% is not directly comparable, what they do show, is the improvement in the portfolio mix, the buckets that we talked about.",1446
18511,"2015m5","At the 31st of March 2012, 22% of the portfolio value was in 31 companies with negative earnings growth.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Now 3 years later, only 7% by value of the portfolio, or 7 companies, have negative growth.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the strong performance of our keepers on our more recent investments, are not being diluted.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Action makes a significant contribution to this measure of earnings growth, because it's our largest investment and it's growing at 30%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","If you take out Action, the growth is 16%, which is still very respectable.",1446
18511,"2015m5","All our most recent investments are included in the calculation, and about 2% of the total growth comes from the 20-or-so acquisitions made by our portfolio companies, and substantially funded from their own resources.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's the effect of the portfolio dynamism that Simon talked about.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The growth goes flows to the unrealized value growth, in what we call performance of GBP 417 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That strong performance also reflects the fact that we have only used lower forecast earnings for 2 portfolio companies, with a total value of GBP 63 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's down from 4 companies valued at GBP 99 million last year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Now in the past, I've talked about the approach we take to setting multiples, and the effect that approach has on our valuations, especially when Equity Markets are so high.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We monitor comparable quota companies, but we are also guided by our exit expectations and the longer-term cycle or sector trends.",1446
18511,"2015m5","With the FTSE 100 around 7,000 and the average multiple of our relevant global market indices increasing by over 16% in the year, and 12% in the last quarter alone, we adjusted the multiples are used in 70% of cases.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We still recorded a GBP 64 million increase in value from multiple expansion, and that was mostly due to our decision to increase the multiple we used to value Action, from 12.",1446
18511,"2015m5","5x post-discount to 13.",1446
18511,"2015m5","If we exclude Action, the value-weighted average post-discount multiple is 9.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Simon mentioned our investments in Scandlines, as well as good performance, the valuation has also increased because we have extended our assumption about the opening date of the competing tunnel.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Scandlines is the main contributor to the increase in the DCF category.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The imminent sale category includes Azelis, Touch Tunes, Inspector and Zoya.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The sale of Azelis is an excellent outcome.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Its value of the 31st of March was GBP 26 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We completed the transaction last week, and expect to receive proceeds of GBP 66 million shortly.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that GBP 66 million is fully reflected in the value at the 31st of March 2015.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The performance of our quota portfolio reflects the investment's good performance and the positive equity market sentiment.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Finally, on the portfolio, here the top 20 Private Equity investments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","They account for 79% of the portfolio, and are generally trending with a positive outlook.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The strong performance of the portfolio and our realizations mean an increase in the amount that we accrue for carried interest payable to the investment team.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The majority of our Private Equity investments are now held in carry schemes that have met their performance hurdle, assuming we sold everything today at book value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we now expect to accrue carry capable of between 10% to 15% of the gross investment return.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And it's only paid out when the hurdle is met with cash returns.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As you can see, we paid GBP 7 million in cash in the period.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The multiples and the growth capital fund have now increased to 1.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The 2010 to 2012 assets in Eurofund V, which include Action, continued to perform well.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But other fund level, we also include the 2007 to 2009 investments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we reman below performance hurdle, that means we are not recognizing carry receivable for this fund.",1446
18511,"2015m5","During the year, the growth capital fund has passed this performance hurdle on the valuation basis.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we've now recognized GBP 25 million of carry receivable from this fund.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So this has been another strong year for Private Equity, the biggest contributor and our solid foundation for our NAV progression.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Infrastructure business contributes to our returns through our 34% investment in 3i Infrastructure plc, and through the profitability of its Funds Management and advisory activity.",1446
18511,"2015m5","There has been a step change in infrastructure's contribution through gross investment return.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's because the share price of 3iN increased by 19% to 160p, which together with dividend income, contributed to a total shareholder return of 25%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","3iN announced its results on Tuesday, and they reported a 24.",1446
18511,"2015m5","6% [ph] return as a result of the sale of Eversholt Rail, and significant valuation uplifts on its core European portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As well as the advisory fee, we earn an NAV based performance fee.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as a result of 3iN's strong performance in the year, we expect to receive a fee of GBP 45 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","75% of that has been set aside for the investment team, in line with the maintenance that we have put in place at the time of 3iN's listing.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've introduced a significant element of deferral in these performance rewards, and we will award a substantial portion over at least 3 to 5 years.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that will be in line with the principles of the compensation review that we completed in 2013.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Debt Management business is principally a Funds Management platform.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our teams at both the U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","and Europe, had a very good year of fundraising.",1446
18511,"2015m5","During the year, Debt Management closed 6 new CLOs in Europe and the U.",1446
18511,"2015m5",", and the team launched a new mid-market loan fund in Europe.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Those CLOs and new fund added GBP 2.",1446
18511,"2015m5","4 billion to our AUM, which more than offset the runoff in the older European funds.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we've finished the year with assets under management of GBP 7.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We invested GBP 105 million of our Proprietary Capital in Debt Management, split between GBP 26 million in warehouses, that will siege future CLO launches, and GBP 79 million in the CLOs that we've actually launched.",1446
18511,"2015m5","After divestments, we had 160 [ph] -- GBP 176 million of value invested in Debt Management products.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Ignoring capital flows, there was a net value reduction of GBP 25 million this year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Almost 2/3 of that GBP 25 million was the result of distributions paid.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But there were also some short-term mark-to-market volatility in the valuation of recent CLO issues.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Fee income increased to GBP 34 million, and if we include portfolio income, the business generated GBP 56 million of cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So all 3 businesses contributed to the strong performance, and that is borne out by our strong set of KPIs.",1446
18511,"2015m5","At the group level, we have achieved an annual cash operating profit of GBP 28 million, and that's a very real increase from our first time profit of GBP 5 million in 2014.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've also made progress in generating operating income from both our fund and asset management activities while staying highly disciplined on costs.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Operating expenses, excluding restructuring costs, have increased by 2% [ph] mainly due to increased in variable compensation as business performance has improved and AUM increased by 4%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As we finished the period of restructuring and transition, we have started some recruitment to support investment activity in all 3 business lines.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But we remain totally focused on cost discipline, and we expect costs to stay at around 1% of AUM.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have a strong balance sheet and our financial performance during the year has strengthened it even further.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We finished the year with net cash of GBP 49 million and gross debt of GBP 815 [ph] million, made up of our bonds due in 2017, 2023 and 2032.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We refinanced the RCF in September, extending its maturities to 2019, with the potential to extend out to 2020 and 2021.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Liquidity is also strong.",1446
18511,"2015m5","GBP 864 million  of the GBP 1.",1446
18511,"2015m5","2 billion is now cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In 2012, we talked about a target capital allocation model that would increase the funds available for future investments and enhance distribution to shareholders.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As Simon said, today, we have proposed a 20p dividend for the year, which equates to a final dividend of 14p.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's ahead of our expected range of 15% to 20% of gross cash realization proceeds, but it reflects the board's confidence in both the performance of the business and the strength of the balance sheet.",1446
18511,"2015m5","At the 14p proposed, 5.",1446
18511,"2015m5","4p is the final base dividend, and 8.",1446
18511,"2015m5","6p is the additional dividend.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So our performance in FY 2015 was strong.",1446
18511,"2015m5","All 3 businesses are performing well, and our results provide further evidence of the progress that we have made since 2012.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Thank you very much, and Sam Min and I will now be happy to take your questions.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, [indiscernible] much, much to said I would echo that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean clearly, we still operate with a quite significant cash flows in and out each individual transaction now, is material.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I may not be the Scottish Finance Director, but I am the finance director that talked to you about the gearing of 103% [ph], within the sort of more recent memory.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the gearing on gearing within the portfolio, is a real factor that we have to think about.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I mean, clearly, the cash is very strong, with an eye telling the net cash balance on the balance sheet, that we wanted to be practical about the application of our dividend policy, and confirm the dividend of 20p today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we'll consider that sort of practical application.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Good morning, everyone.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Welcome to 3i's results for the year to the 31st of March 2015.",1446

18511,"2015m5","There has been a complete transformation in our total return on opening net asset value.",1446

18511,"2015m5","Our asset management initiatives are much sharper focus in PE, have driven our solid Proprietary Capital performance.",1446
18511,"2015m5","At the same time, our cost discipline and the development of our 2 smaller businesses have removed the leakage the company was seeing from an unnecessary large and complex cost base.",1446

18511,"2015m5","So how will we take 3i forward from here? Well, the emphasis going forward is based on our assessment of where we can secure the best returns for shareholders.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In particular, we see mid-market Private Equity investment across our northern European and U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","platforms, as giving us the best opportunity for attractive and sustainable alpha returns.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But we have to stay in the mid-market, where we believe the competition is less intense.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we have to be prepared to be patient, and to pass on opportunities where the valuation challenges our confidence in delivering a 2x return.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So because we have a strong balance sheet and we see a limited opportunity for high return investments in today's competitive markets, we intend to fund the lion's share of new PE investments from proprietary 3i capital.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We don't think it's sensible to turn ourselves into an asset gatherer with lower return expectations, when we are choosing to focus on the mid-market where you can only put so much money to work if we maintain our price discipline.",1446

18511,"2015m5","It's been another very good year for the team, and well done to them.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Originally, this was meant to be a relatively quiet year for realization proceeds, but we've materially exceeded our expectations.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The majority of our divestment activity is focused on our weaker assets in buckets 3 and 4, where we've recovered significant value by more active asset management over the last few years.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Although we also sold too high-quality bucket 2 assets earlier in the year at 2x cost being highlighted.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We now have about half the investments we started with in 2012, and we aim to take this further down to between 30 and 40 companies over the next few years.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That will allow more time for active asset management as well as thoughtful origination.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have, once again, been carefully investors, passing on opportunities where pricing is too aggressive, and sticking close to our key sectors and geographies.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And the quality of the portfolio has improved yet again.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've sold a good number of challenged investments in this benign environment for realizations.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As a result, our stronger investments or keepers now dominate our portfolio, and this bodes very well for future value growth of 3i.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You can clearly see the quality of our current PE portfolio in the 19% weighted average earnings growth over the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And the dynamism in this portfolio is demonstrated by the EUR 400 million of bolt-on acquisitions our investee companies made over that year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As I said earlier, we have taken advantage of current pricing environment and current [ph] IPO markets to move on some of our important buckets 3 assets, including Phibro, ALLTEL and Refresco Gerber.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that realization momentum has continued into this year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Looking at bucket 3, I am probably most pleased with the sales of Azelis, which has been a very difficult asset for 3i.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In 2012, the business was performing very poorly and running out of cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I was very reluctant to put more money into the company without some very fundamental change.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we agreed to change the Chairman, the CEO and most of the senior management team, and supports a new plan for the business.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Committing to put more funding into a poorly performing company in a difficult sector in a tough environment is always a real challenge, especially if you happen to be the Chairman of the investment committee.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But our faith in the new team and in their plan has definitely paid off with nets and sales and recovery value which we completed last month.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Well done to the 3i team and the Azelis management on this one, it's been a real grind.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And they've had more than a few choice conversations with me along the way.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But they don't all come good, though, and we've had to take a write-off of some GBP 32 million on inspector, as its performance deteriorated on the back of the weak Finnish and Russian economies.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We wound up selling the asset for GBP 6 million after our March year end.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But let's turn to the sunny upland in some of our keeper assets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Action continues to power on, with another fantastic performance of 30% earnings growth in 2014, and like-for-like growth of some 7%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It opened over 100 new stores, with the majority being in France and Germany, where the concept has been very well received by consumers.",1446
18511,"2015m5","This year, they will embark on an even more ambitious store opening program.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Scandlines has also enjoyed its strong year, with good EBITDA growth and a very successful and value accretive sale of their joint venture.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The prospects for 2015 looks sound, and it's clear from the comments of various parties involved, that delays are more tricky to the completion of the tunnel, which will ultimately compete with Scandlines main route, between rugby and put guard.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And by the way, we are intending to bring the management of Scandlines and Basic-Fit to London on June 15 for an investor and analyst presentation.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've again been very active in the new investment market, as well as supporting a good number of bolt-on acquisitions for our portfolio of companies.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In fact, we've committed GBP 368 million, but pricing took a number of targets out of our reach, and we're determined to maintain our price discipline in the current environment, even if that means the lower levels of realization of investment for a period of time.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our infrastructure team delivered a strong year, with the gross investment return of 20%, driven by a total shareholder return of 25% at 3iN.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And the underperformance fee of GBP 45 million, based on  3iN's strong NAV growth and the sale of Eversholt.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The new investment market across the Infrastructure segment has seen some very rich prices paid for super core assets, well beyond our appetite.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But we did continue to source some good quality primary PPP investments, as well as further medium-sized core investment with Oiltanking.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The very successful sale of Eversholt was one of a series of recent transactions in the sector where very high prices have been paid.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Fortunately for us, 3iN owns a quality portfolio of core assets which were assembled in a very different environment to the one we see today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Today's environment could be characterized as a land grab, where a limited supply of available super core assets by investors such as Sovereign Wealth Funds.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You often have a very long time horizon, and who are struggling to find long-term yield in today's traditional investment markets and fixed income.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And in the light of these tightening market conditions, 3iN has decided to update its own return objectives and dividend policy, as you can see here.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I know our team is very focused on where they can find further core investments, away from those large super core assets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Debt Management team has also, had a very productive year, with strong CLO issuance and good new product developments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","They are now beginning to make an important contribution to the group's economics, and the profitability of the fund management business, in particular.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have delivered another large shift in capital efficiency and capital allocation, with a material reduction in operating and interest costs, making more cash available for shareholder distributions and investment.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as a result of our strong realizations and healthy balance sheet, we're announcing today, a final dividend of 14p per share.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That gives us a total of 20p for FY '15.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's a yield of 5% on our opening share price of 3.",1446
18511,"2015m5","98p [ph] 
So we've had another very good year to finish our 3-year restructuring phase.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've met or exceeded all the targets we set ourselves, as well as continuing to sell assets at good premiums to book value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We enter this new phase for 3i in much better and resilient shape.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We continue to sell investments of group premiums to book value, and the remaining portfolio is generally of much higher quality.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And this portfolio, with earnings growth of 19%, was valued at 10.",1446
18511,"2015m5","5x EBITDA at 31st of March, compared to 14.",1446
18511,"2015m5","6x EBITDA for the FTSE 250 Index.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The group itself now benefits from a flexible and cost-effective investment platform and a balance sheet with net cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have clarity within the group about how we aim to develop our business going forward, and our investment teams are now performing in asset management terms, just as well as any of their rivals in the markets they operate in.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Now I'd like to close by saying, as an investment business, we're susceptible to broad economic and political trends, as well as regulatory change of financial services.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And while we see a general recovery across many of the markets we operate in.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We are mindful that a big part of this recovery is still very fragile.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And there are some worrying bubbles building up in various asset markets because of the current monitoring market conditions.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So as a result, we intend to remain careful in our approach to new investment, while we actively manage our existing portfolio and take advantage of buoyant realization markets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Quality and thoughtful origination will be key, and we are recruiting further origination talent across our international platform.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's really encouraging that 3i is once again, performing as it should in its 70th year since the original foundation of the business.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And it's exciting that there's still so much more to be done.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So on that note, I'll pass over to Julia, who will give you more details and color on the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's worth reflecting on Action, what it is and how it's different, because you've seen a couple of stocks come to the market here [indiscernible] and.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Action, unlike those 2, is a multi-country retailer, and it's got what I call, the Holy Grail of retail in that -- the box that opens in Holland is the same as the box that opens in Belgium, in Germany and in France, and wherever it decides to go to next.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So that is a great advantage the company has.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's not dependent on food.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's got 10 categories, they're all about the same.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So it's a general discounter.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And it has a lot of momentum in the business in Europe, because finding good retail sites or sites that Action trade-out of fairly easily, is much easier than it would be than if it was trying to find the same sort of sites in the U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So there are a lot of fundamental drivers about Action that give us a great deal of comfort.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just 2 questions, please.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the first one is just thinking about the earnings growth of the underlying portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's been strong for quite a while now, and I don't mean this to come for us a long way, but how much of that is 3i management, and how much of that is because the company's are in structural growth industries? And I guess, following on from that, how sustainable is the earnings growth momentum, do you think? And then my second question is just on the investment side.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You mentioned you don't really want to -- as a business, keep just sort of gathering cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So how should we think about like a run rate investment number now, or how do you -- I should say, how do you think about 3i's investments in terms of your run rate? Okay.",1446
18511,"2015m5","There are some mics at the back.",1446
18511,"2015m5","They'll bring them up to you.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Philip? Yes.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, there's not much to add to that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I would echo that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, clearly, we still operate with quite significant cash flows in and out, each individual transaction now is material.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I may not be the Scottish finance director, but I am the finance director that talked to you about gearing of 103%, within the sort of more recent memory.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the gearing-on-gearing within the portfolio is a real factor that we have to think about.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, clearly, the cash is very strong.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And it was with an eye at having net cash balance on the balance sheet that we wanted to be practical about the application of our dividend policy, and confirm the dividend at 20p today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we'll continue that sort of practical application.",1446
18511,"2015m5","[indiscernible] Good morning, everyone.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Welcome to 3i's results for the year to the 31st of March 2015.",1446

18511,"2015m5","We've sold a good number of challenged investments in this benign environment for realizations.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As a result, our stronger investments or keepers now dominate our portfolio, and this bodes very well for future value growth of 3i.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You can clearly see the quality of our current PE portfolio in the 19% weighted average earnings growth over the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And the dynamism in this portfolio is demonstrated by the EUR 400 million of bolt-on acquisitions our investee companies made over that year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As I said earlier, we have taken advantage of current pricing environment and buoyant IPO markets to move on some of our important bucket 3 assets, including Phibro, Eltel and Refresco Gerber.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that realization momentum has continued into this year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Looking at bucket 3, I am probably most pleased with the sale of Azelis, which has been a very difficult asset for 3i.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In 2012, the business was performing very poorly and running out of cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I was very reluctant to put more money into the company without some very fundamental change.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we agreed to change the Chairman, the CEO and most of the senior management team, and support a new plan for the business.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Committing to put more funding into a poorly performing company in a difficult sector, in a tough environment, is always a real challenge, especially if you happen to be the Chairman of the Investment Committee.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But our faith in the new team and in their plan has definitely paid off, with an excellent sale and recovery of value, which we completed last month.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Well done to the 3i team and the Azelis management on this one.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's been a real grind.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And they've had more than a few choice conversations with me along the way.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But they don't all come good, though, and we've had to take a write-off of some GBP 32 million on Inspecta, as its performance deteriorated on the back of the weak Finnish and Russian economies.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We wound up selling the asset for GBP 6 million after our March year end.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But let's turn to the sunny uplands at some of our keeper assets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Action continues to power on, with another fantastic performance of 30% earnings growth in 2014, and like-for-like growth of some 7%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It opened over 100 new stores, with the majority being in France and Germany, where the concept has been very well received by consumers.",1446
18511,"2015m5","This year, they will embark on an even more ambitious store opening program.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Scandlines has also enjoyed a strong year, with good EBITDA growth and a very successful and value-accretive sale of their H-H joint venture.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The prospects for 2015 looks sound, and it's clear from the comments of various parties involved that delays are more likely to the completion of the tunnel, which will ultimately compete with Scandlines' main route between Rødby and Puttgarden.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And by the way, we are intending to bring the management of Scandlines and Basic-Fit to London on June 15 for an investor and analyst presentation.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've again been very active in the new investment market as well as supporting a good number of bolt-on acquisitions for our portfolio companies.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In fact, we've committed GBP 368 million, but pricing took a number of targets out of our reach, and we're determined to maintain our price discipline in the current environment, even if that means lower levels of realization of investment for a period of time.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Infrastructure team delivered a strong year, with a gross investment return of 20%, driven by a total shareholder return of 25% at 3iN.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And they earned a performance fee of GBP 45 million, based on 3iN's strong NAV growth and the sale of Eversholt.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The new investment market across the Infrastructure segment has seen some very rich prices paid for super core assets, well beyond our appetite.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But we did continue to source some good quality primary PPP investments as well as further medium-sized core -- a further medium-sized core investment with Oiltanking.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The very successful sale of Eversholt was one of a series of recent transactions in the sector where very high prices have been paid.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Fortunately for us, 3iN owns a quality portfolio of core assets which were assembled in a very different environment to the one we see today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Today's environment could be characterized as a land grab for a limited supply of available super core assets by investors such as sovereign wealth funds, who often have a very long time horizon and who are struggling to find long-term yield in today's traditional investment markets in fixed income.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And in the light of these tightening market conditions, 3iN has decided to update its own return objectives and dividend policy, as you can see here.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I know our team is very focused on where they can find further core investments, away from those large super core assets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Debt Management team has also had a very productive year, with strong CLO issuance and good new product developments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","They are now beginning to make an important contribution to the group's economics, and the profitability of the Fund Management business, in particular.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have delivered another large shift in capital efficiency and capital allocation, with a material reduction in operating and interest costs, making more cash available for shareholder distributions and investment.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as a result of our strong realizations and healthy balance sheet, we're announcing today a final dividend of 14p per share.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That gives us a total of 20p for FY '15.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's a yield of 5% on our opening share price of 398p.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we've had another very good year to finish our 3-year restructuring phase.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've met or exceeded all the targets we set ourselves as well as continuing to sell assets at good premiums to book value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We enter this new phase for 3i in much better and resilient shape.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We continue to sell investments of group premiums to book value, and the remaining portfolio is generally of much higher quality.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And this portfolio, with earnings growth of 19%, was valued at 10.",1446
18511,"2015m5","5x EBITDA at the 31st of March, compared to 14.",1446
18511,"2015m5","6x EBITDA for the FTSE 250 Index.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The group itself now benefits from a flexible and cost-effective investment platform and a balance sheet with net cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have clarity within the group about how we aim to develop our business going forward, and our investment teams are now performing in asset management terms, just as well as any of their rivals in the markets they operate in.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Now I'd like to close by saying, as an investment business, we're susceptible to broad economic and political trends as well as regulatory change in financial services.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And while we see a general recovery across many of the markets we operate in, we are mindful that a big part of this recovery is still very fragile.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And there are some worrying bubbles building up in various asset markets because of the current monetary market conditions.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So as a result, we intend to remain careful in our approach to new investment, while we actively manage our existing portfolio and take advantage of buoyant realization markets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Quality and thoughtful origination will be key, and we are recruiting further origination talent across our international platform.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's really encouraging that 3i is once again performing as it should in its 70th year since the original foundation of the business.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And it's exciting that there's still so much more to be done.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So on that note, I'll pass over to Julia, who will give you more details and color on the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Well, maybe Julia can take the second question, I'll deal with the first.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think we come out of auctions pretty well, if the clearing price in the auction is a sensible price.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So both American assets and Aspen Pumps were auctions, they were quite narrow auctions and, ultimately, once the price got to a certain point, the influence of management in who they'd rather travel with going forward becomes very important.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I think our team do a really good job at getting alongside management and convincing them that the approach of 3i and the longer-term perspective that we have about investing, is a very good place for them to join, if you like.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So all 3 of those businesses were in auctions.",1446
18511,"2015m5","All 3 of those business, we bought at prices we're very comfortable with.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But in the end, it came down to choice of management as to who they chose, and they chose us.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I think that's the sort of performance we like to see when we're in an auction process.",1446
18511,"2015m5","If it's just about price, and as I said there is a [indiscernible] or 2 in there, then we're not going to play in that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think, Christ, on the other hand, we had very good insight into that business because of Amor.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So although that may have been dressed up as an auction, it was pretty clear to us we had a very powerful position and we were able to lock that investment down pretty early on in the process.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Let me have a go.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, in terms of the earnings growth, I think this really splits down.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So ultimately, it's the management of these businesses that really determine the strength of the earnings growth, whether it be an Azelis or whether it be an Action.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But the 3i teams are very knowledgeable and engaged shareholders, so they can be very good at prompting change and also making judgments that use our other experiences in the past or across the portfolio to help management tackle market challenges.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And in particular, our own style is to help businesses internationalize.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And again, we have a lot of experience in internationalizing these mid-sized companies and bringing contacts and other benefits to those management.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the fundamental driver, particularly of the better company is down, I would say in the main, to them being good companies in interesting sectors with strong management teams and a very engaged shareholder.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've been more hands-on and more active in the problem companies, where we've seen a very significant turnaround from negative earnings momentum to, in some cases, really quite positive earnings momentum.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that's involved a great deal of time from the 3i executives involved in them.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, is it sustainable? I suppose what we have seen a broadly is a pickup in confidence in the overall environment over the last 6 months, in particular, really since the European Central Bank started signaling that QE was going to be the order of the day.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So that was quite noticeable across much of the portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I think the better companies will continue to prosper.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Fortunately, for us, the better companies now dominate the value of the portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we're anticipating another healthy year coming out of this portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We don't see any dramatic change or anything like that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The last point was the investment point? Okay.",1446
18511,"2015m5","On the realizations, I'd love to think it would -- well, particularly, the bottom 2 buckets go to 0, but I think that's unlikely.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think we're always going to have a ragbag around at the bottom.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But it'll be de minimis in terms of value, ultimately.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So it won't be, in any way, a real driver or drag on the growth coming out of our portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I would expect to see this trend continue quite strongly over the next couple of years, even if it doesn't quite get to 0.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In terms of dividend policy, maybe I'll make a comment and then Julia can pick this up, I would say we gave a guidance back in 2012, '13 to reassure shareholders that we were going to be providing meaningful cash dividends going forward, the 15% to 20% of realizations.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that's what we've used.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's been a guidance for that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But if you look at 3i today, I think it is a strong cash machine going forward.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So whether we're a slave to that original dividend guidance or whether we tipped slightly over it, as we did today, I think these are nice problems to have that we'll address as we come to them.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just wondering whether you could give a bit of guidance on what's happened ever since the 31st of March, basically, in terms of sort of the amount of realizations that you've agreed, that haven't yet completed, what the uplifts might be on there and the FX effect? Thank you, Simon.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So as Simon has confirmed, we have consistently met or exceeded the objectives we set for ourselves for the 3 years since 2012.",1446
18511,"2015m5","These results give you further evidence of the progress that we've made in building value for our shareholders.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Importantly, the results show how all 3 of our businesses are performing well.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just to be clear, I will, again, be referring to our investment basis numbers rather than our audited statutory results.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As usual, I've included a reconciliation between the 2 sets of numbers in the pack.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The total return and NAV are the same under each basis.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our results show how we are building value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You can see the excellent performance from our portfolio of investments in the 19% increase in Private Equity portfolio earnings, which underpinned the GBP 684 million value growth.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We generated a good flow of realizations, delivering proceeds of GBP 841 million, and a money multiple of 2x.",1446
18511,"2015m5","When you exclude refinancings, the uplift over book value was 27%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have a significantly more robust and efficient platform, and our cash operating profit increased from GBP 5 million to GBP 28 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Fund Management business has delivered an underlying operating profit of GBP 33 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as Simon said, our balance sheet is sound, and we have funded GBP 474 million of total cash investments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The strength of realizations and the significant reduction in cash leakage from cost and interests, have allowed us to close the year with no gearing.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The model is working well.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that's why we have announced a total dividend for the year of 20p per share.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We closed the year with NAV per share of 396p, up 14% on last year, and a total return of 20%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's great results.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You can see on this slide the positive contribution that we've had from both value growth realized profits.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The impact of the reduction in our cost base and interest build means that the dilution of those returns is significantly lower.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The net carry payable is a direct cost of the strong portfolio performance that we've delivered.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Currency was volatile throughout the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In the end, the net translation effect of a strong U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","dollar and a weaker euro took 12p off NAV.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I've given you the updated sensitivities and the breakdown of net assets by currency in the back of the pack, so you can continue to track these effects.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Finally, we paid 6p of our proposed 20p total dividend in January.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Together with last year's final dividend, that results in the 19p that you can see here.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As you've seen, all 3 of our businesses contributed to the strong performance in the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I'll focus on the individual businesses first before covering the group KPIs in more detail.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Private Equity has had a very good year, generating a gross investment return of GBP 719 million, and that's after FX, or 24% of opening portfolio value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've reduced the portfolio to 65 investments at the year end, right in line with our longer-term aim to reduce to less than 40 assets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And while the overall number of companies in the portfolio -- reducing the overall number of companies in the portfolio, we've generated realized profits of GBP 144 million, and an uplift of 27% over opening value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we've reshaped the portfolio towards what we call our keeper assets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Of the GBP 830 million cash proceeds that we received from Private Equity, GBP 155 million was the result of our decision to take advantage of favorable debt markets to refinance some of our strongest and cash-generative investments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Here, I'm talking about Action, Element and Amor.",1446
18511,"2015m5","When there is a refinancing, cash is usually returned to us by repayment of shareholder loans, which means there's little or no uplift on those proceeds.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In total, we fully sold 19 assets, generating GBP 456 million of proceeds as well as realizing good returns from investments such as Hilite, a 31% IRR and a 2.",1446
18511,"2015m5","1x money multiple; and Vedici, a 48% uplift and another 2x money multiple.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We also sold a 12 investments, which had an individual book values of less than GBP 5 million each, at the 31st of March 2014.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Bouyant Equity Markets meant we were able to IPO 4 companies: Phibro in the U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","in April, D.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Phone in China in July; they were followed by Eltel in Stockholm; and Refresco in Amsterdam towards the end of the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We completely sold down our investments in Phibro during the year, and we realized GBP 273 million in proceeds from IPOs and quota sales.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as at the 31st of March 2015, our quota portfolio had a closing value of GBP 273 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Realizations and our cash to cash returns are the ultimate measure of our success.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But in the meantime, the value growth in our portfolio gives you evidence of the progress that we are making.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Value-weighted earnings growth was 19% for the 33 companies that we value on an earnings basis.",1446
18511,"2015m5","By comparison, that measure was 9% 3 years ago.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And although the 19% and the 9% are not directly comparable, what they do show is the improvement in the portfolio mix, the buckets that we talked about.",1446
18511,"2015m5","At the 31st of March 2012, 22% of the portfolio value was in 31 companies with negative earnings growth.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Now 3 years later, only 7% by value of the portfolio, or 7 companies, have negative growth.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the strong performance of our keepers and our more recent investments are not being diluted.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Action makes a significant contribution to this measure of earnings growth because it's our largest investment and it's growing at 30%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","If you take out Action, the growth is 16%, which is still very respectable.",1446
18511,"2015m5","All our most recent investments are included in the calculation, and about 2% of the total growth comes from the 20-or-so acquisitions made by our portfolio companies, and substantially funded from their own resources.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's the effect of the portfolio dynamism that Simon talked about.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The growth goes flows through to the unrealized value growth in what we call performance of GBP 417 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That strong performance also reflects the fact that we have only used lower forecast earnings for 2 portfolio companies, with a total value of GBP 63 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's down from 4 companies valued at GBP 99 million last year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Now in the past, I've talked about the approach we take to setting multiples and the effect that approach has on our valuations, especially when Equity Markets are so high.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We monitor comparable quota companies, but we are also guided by our exit expectations and the longer-term cycle or sector trends.",1446
18511,"2015m5","With the FTSE 100 around 7,000 and the average multiple of our relevant global market indices increasing by over 16% in the year, and 12% in the last quarter alone, we adjusted the multiples we used in 70% of cases.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We still recorded a GBP 64 million increase in value from multiple expansion, and that was mostly due to our decision to increase the multiple we used to value Action, from 12.",1446
18511,"2015m5","5x post-discount to 13.",1446
18511,"2015m5","If we exclude Action, the value-weighted average post-discount multiple is 9.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Simon mentioned our investments in Scandlines.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As well as good performance, the valuation has also increased because we have extended our assumption about the opening date of the competing tunnel.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Scandlines is the main contributor to the increase in the DCF category.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The imminent sale category includes Azelis, Touchtunes, Inspecta and Soya.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The sale of Azelis is an excellent outcome.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Its value at the 31st of March was GBP 26 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We completed the transaction last week, and expect to receive proceeds of GBP 66 million shortly.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that GBP 66 million is fully reflected in the value at the 31st of March 2015.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The performance of our quota portfolio reflects the investment's good performance and positive equity market sentiment.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Finally, on the portfolio, here are the top 20 Private Equity investments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","They account for 79% of the portfolio, and are generally trending with a positive outlook.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The strong performance of the portfolio and our realizations mean an increase in the amount that we accrue for carried interest payable to the investment team.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The majority of our Private Equity investments are now held in carry schemes that have met their performance hurdle, assuming we sold everything today at book value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we now expect to accrue carry payable at between 10% to 15% of the gross investment return.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And it's only paid out when the hurdle is met with cash returns.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As you can see, we paid GBP 7 million in cash in the period.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The multiples for Eurofund V and the growth capital fund have now increased to 1.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The 2010 to 2012 assets in Eurofund V, which include Action, continued to perform well.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But at the fund level, we also include the 2007 to 2009 investments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we remain below the performance hurdle, and that means we are not recognizing carry receivable for this fund.",1446
18511,"2015m5","During the year, the growth capital fund has passed its performance hurdle on a valuation basis.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we've now recognized GBP 25 million of carry receivable from this fund.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So this has been another strong year for Private Equity, the biggest contributor and now a solid foundation for our NAV progression.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Infrastructure business contributes to our returns through our 34% investment in 3i Infrastructure plc, and through the profitability of its Funds Management and advisory activity.",1446
18511,"2015m5","There has been a step change in Infrastructure's contribution through gross investment return.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's because the share price of 3iN increased by 19% to 160p, which together with dividend income, contributed to a total shareholder return of 25%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","3iN announced its results on Tuesday, and they reported a 24.",1446
18511,"2015m5","6% return as a result of the sale of Eversholt Rail and significant valuation uplifts on its core European portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As well as the advisory fee, we earn an NAV-based performance fee.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as a result of 3iN's strong performance in the year, we expect to receive a fee of GBP 45 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","75% of that has been set aside for the investment team, in line with the arrangements that were put in place at the time of 3iN's listing.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've introduced a significant element of deferral in these performance rewards, and we will award a substantial proportion over at least 3 to 5 years.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that will be in line with the principles of the compensation review that we completed in 2013.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Debt Management business is principally a Funds Management platform.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our teams at both the U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","and Europe, had a very good year of fundraising.",1446
18511,"2015m5","During the year, Debt Management closed 6 new CLOs in Europe and the U.",1446
18511,"2015m5",", and the team launched a new mid-market loan fund in Europe.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Those CLOs and new fund added GBP 2.",1446
18511,"2015m5","4 billion to our AUM, which more than offset the runoff in the older European funds.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we've finished the year with assets under management of GBP 7.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We invested GBP 105 million of our Proprietary Capital in Debt Management, split between GBP 26 million in warehouses that will seat future CLO launches, and GBP 79 million in the CLOs that we've actually launched.",1446
18511,"2015m5","After divestments, we had 160 [ph] -- GBP 176 million of value invested in Debt Management products.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Ignoring capital flows, there was a net value reduction of GBP 25 million this year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Almost 2/3 of that GBP 25 million was the result of distributions paid.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But there were also some short-term mark-to-market volatility in the valuation of recent CLO issues.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Fee income increased to GBP 34 million, and if we include portfolio income, the business generated GBP 56 million of cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So all 3 businesses contributed to the strong performance, and that is borne out by our strong set of KPIs.",1446
18511,"2015m5","At the group level, we have achieved an annual cash operating profit of GBP 28 million, and that's a very real increase from our first time profit of GBP 5 million in 2014.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've also made progress in generating operating income from both our fund and asset management activities, while staying highly disciplined on costs.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Operating expenses, excluding restructuring costs, have increased by 2%, mainly due to increased variable compensation, as business performance has improved and AUM increased by 4%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As we finished the period of restructuring and transition, we have started some recruitment to support investment activity in all 3 business lines.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But we remain totally focused on cost discipline, and we expect costs to stay at around 1% of AUM.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have a strong balance sheet and our financial performance during the year has strengthened this even further.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We finished the year with net cash of GBP 49 million and gross debt of GBP 815 million, made up of our bonds due in 2017, 2023 and 2032.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We refinanced the RCF in September, extending its maturity to 2019, with the potential to extend out to 2020 and 2021.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Liquidity is also strong.",1446
18511,"2015m5","GBP 864 million of the GBP 1.",1446
18511,"2015m5","2 billion is now cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In 2012, we talked about a target capital allocation model that would increase the funds available for future investments and enhance distribution to shareholders.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As Simon said, today, we have proposed a 20p dividend for the year, which equates to a final dividend of 14p.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's ahead of our expected range of 15% to 20% of gross cash realization proceeds, but it reflects the board's confidence in both the performance of the business and the strength of the balance sheet.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Of the 14p proposed, 5.",1446
18511,"2015m5","4p is the final base dividend and 8.",1446
18511,"2015m5","6p is the additional dividend.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So our performance in FY 2015 was strong.",1446
18511,"2015m5","All 3 businesses are performing well, and our results provide further evidence of the progress that we have made since 2012.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Thank you very much, and Simon and I will now be happy to take questions.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just a couple.",1446
18511,"2015m5","One, sort of, I guess following on from Philip's question is, I guess, no process is purely proprietary.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So where you do have to compete in auctions, are you paying the top price? Or are you able to bring some kind of edge into play? You have a network, your experience in internationalizing businesses, et cetera.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And just on Action, increasing it by a turn, was that you're decision or was that taken in discussion, I guess, with the auditors, given your previous comments on the valuation of that asset? It's worth reflecting on Action, what it is and how it's different because you've seen a couple of stocks come to the market here, B&M and Poundland.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Action, unlike those 2, is a multi-country retailer, and it's got what I call, the Holy Grail of retail in that the box that opens in Holland is the same as the box that opens in Belgium, in Germany and in France, and wherever it decides to go to next.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So that is a great advantage the company has.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's not dependent on food.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's got 10 categories, they're all about the same.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So it's a general discounter.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And it has a lot of momentum in the business in Europe, because finding good retail sites or sites that Action trade out off fairly easily, is much easier than it would be if it was trying to find the same sort of sites in the U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So there are a lot of fundamental drivers about Action that give us a great deal of confidence.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You want to do? And then on the decision to change the multiple on Action, I mean, it won't surprise you to know that there's a fair amount of attention during the audit process and the valuation process on the valuation of Action.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But I'd say, there were sort of a number of drivers.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've had another year of strong performance of Action under our ownership, so the confidence in the store rollouts, the use of the run rate earnings was reinforced for us.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I think actually, we've been able to develop a more relevant concept than we had when we first invested in the asset when, really, we were only able to look at more mature U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","discounters, and then some local retailers with the listings of other European and U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","-based discounters, that has allowed us to actually develop a concept which is more relevant.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I think having an eye to that was also important.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think we still think that there's plenty to do in developing the value of Action.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Yes, I think that's right.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've -- in terms of modeling, you should keep using the guidance that we've given.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But we've shown ourselves to be practical in the upper cage [ph].",1446
18511,"2015m5","Once we've gone through our criteria, we've been practical in the way that we've applied it, both last year and this year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So -- but for now, I would continue to use 15% -- 15% to 20% when you're modeling, and at 20%, which is what we said, when investment levels are below where would like to be.",1446
18511,"2015m5","When we gave that guidance, we were coming from a position where the group had been seeing about GBP 100 million of operating cost leakage a year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the other big factor that's clearly changed is we're making an operating cash surplus out of the current business.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think we'd like to be up to EUR 750 million-type of new investment.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's where we'd like to be out of Proprietary Capital.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we can feed that very easily.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But I'll just repeat, we're not going to go there, if it means opening the filters 1 iota.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we'll only go there if we're completely comfortable with the pricing.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Yes? Philip Middleton, Merrill Lynch.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Obviously, these are fantastic results which are well done.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just a couple of questions arising out of those.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Firstly, you talked about the investment pipeline.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Could you tell us a bit more about what you're seeing in terms of valuation there and, in particular, are there any geographical distinctions or are there any sectoral distinctions or any areas where you feel you've got the particular edge that's enabling you to compete? Because that, presumably, will be key in the next 1 or 2 years.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Secondly, on the balance sheet, I can entirely understand why you're backing away from the balance sheet structure you had in certain other areas.",1446
18511,"2015m5","0% is a bit off, is slightly conservative, though, when you look at where -- what, for example, Intermediate Capital is doing, when you look at what some of the other companies like Wendel's doing, I just wondered what modeling you've done to determine that 0% is a good number? It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just 2 questions, please.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the first one is just thinking about the earnings growth in the underlying portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's been strong for quite a while now, and I don't mean this to come across the wrong way, but how much of that is 3i management and how much of that is just because the companies are in structural growth industries? And I guess, following on from that, how sustainable is that earnings growth momentum, do you think? And then my second question is just on the investment side.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You mentioned you don't really want to, as a business, keep just sort of gathering cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So how should we think about like a run rate investment number now, or how do you -- I should say, how do you think about 3i's investments in terms of the run rate? Bill? Okay, I'll take the first.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I'll make 1 comment about the second, but Julia will, no doubt, want to talk about that as well.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, in terms of the investment pipeline, the WIP, as we call it, is pretty busy.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It is reflecting opportunities across our key geographies of North America and northern Europe.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's very much in those sectors that we like.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It is big and it's -- in terms of range of size, so I would think it varies between equity checks of GBP 50 million and GBP 175 million, in terms of size of potential investments, from our point of view.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And clearly, some of those processes are what I would call more proprietorial than general, and where we find ourselves, for one reason or another, in the more proprietorial process, it obviously ultimately leads to a better pricing dynamic, I would say.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In general, it's a very competitive process.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We're careful about how much money we spend on due diligence before we get a better sense of where the pricing is going to be move to.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I think this is one of these things where the crystal ball is very hard to say at the moment.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The good things are that the WIP is wide, there's lots to look at.",1446
18511,"2015m5","All the teams are more focused on origination than asset management because we have the portfolio, generally, in much better shape, the existing portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But how many we pull the trigger on ultimately, because of pricing, is very hard for me to say today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But there are some coming to investment committee, which we're -- obviously, we're very interested in.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I think the outlook for investment gradually improves, but it's always dependent on the market and whether there's some [indiscernible] out there who's going to pay us a good price for that particular asset or not.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think on the balance sheet, what I would say, as the bank that [ph] helped draw up the 3i prospectus in 1994, we -- at that time, we had a Scottish CEO at 3i, called Ewen MacPherson, who is a very strong CEO of the business, and we debated aggressively about the capital structure.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we came to the very simple position that there was enough debt in the portfolio, we didn't need more in the center.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Because when the portfolio went the wrong way, we would need resources to support the portfolio because of the gearing in the portfolio, which averaged similar amounts of gearing to what we see today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So that was the wisdom.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And philosophically, I haven't moved a long way from that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think it holds as well today as it did then.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I'm not sure we want to travel with large amounts of cash, but having a degree of liquidity and little of our own debt to worry about does put us in a very good position to pull the trigger on helping our own companies in a downcycle or a shock, and actually going after some very interesting investments, should that happen.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I think, should that happen, we're in a much better position to capitalize on that now.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's Haley Tam from Citigroup.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Two questions, please.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Firstly, you have mentioned the very buoyant realization environment, and we can see that buckets 2, 3 and 4 have fallen from over [ph] 60% of your portfolio to just 30% at the end of March '15.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Would you discourage me from thinking about that going to 0 by the end of the year, and if so, why? And I guess the follow-up question would be, in relation to that, your dividend policy in the medium-term, how should I think about that? Should that continue -- related to gross realizations or is there any chance that should shift to more of a cash flow basis? Yes, that's fine.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Well, I talked -- I gave you the names of the ones that are on the imminent sale category, which is Azelis, Inspecta, Touchtunes and Soya, and they're effectively all, more or less, all baked into the numbers.",1446
18511,"2015m5","There's a small difference, potentially, on those.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that's roughly about GBP 130 million that we would expect to get in.",1446
18511,"2015m5","FX has not been my friend since the 31st of March, particularly,, post the election results.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the last time I looked, that looked like another GBP 60 million, principally, due -- well, both due to euro and dollar.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as I said, in the back of the pack, you'll see the 1% sensitivities that we've had on FX since the March balance sheet day.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Any other questions? Great, okay.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Thanks for coming today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Good to see you all.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Well, maybe Julia can take the second question, I'll deal with the first.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think we come out of auctions pretty well, if the clearing price in the auction is a sensible price.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So both American assets and Aspen Pumps were auctions, they were quite narrow auctions and, ultimately, once the price got to a certain point, the influence of management in who they'd rather travel with going forward becomes very important.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I think our team do a really good job at getting alongside management and convincing them that the approach of 3i and the longer-term perspective that we have about investing, is a very good place for them to join, if you like.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So all 3 of those businesses were in auctions.",1446
18511,"2015m5","All 3 of those business, we bought at prices we're very comfortable with.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But in the end, it came down to choice of management as to who they chose, and they chose us.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I think that's the sort of performance we like to see when we're in an auction process.",1446
18511,"2015m5","If it's just about price, and as I said there is a Herbert or 2 in there, then we're not going to play in that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think, Christ, on the other hand, we had very good insight into that business because of Amor.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So although that may have been dressed up as an auction, it was pretty clear to us we had a very powerful position and we were able to lock that investment down pretty early on in the process.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Okay, I'll take the first.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I'll make 1 comment about the second, but Julia will, no doubt, want to talk about that as well.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, in terms of the investment pipeline, the WIP, as we call it, is pretty busy.",1446

18511,"2015m5","Action, unlike those 2, is a multi-country retailer, and it's got what I call, the Holy Grail of retail in that the box that opens in Holland is the same as the box that opens in Belgium, in Germany and in France, and wherever it decides to go to next.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So that is a great advantage the company has.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's not dependent on food.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's got 10 categories, they're all about the same.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So it's a general discounter.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And it has a lot of momentum in the business in Europe, because finding good retail sites or sites that Action trade out of fairly easily, is much easier than it would be if it was trying to find the same sort of sites in the U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So there are a lot of fundamental drivers about Action that give us a great deal of confidence.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And then on the decision to change the multiple on Action, I mean, it won't surprise you to know that there's a fair amount of attention during the audit process and the valuation process on the valuation of Action.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But I'd say, there were sort of a number of drivers.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've had another year of strong performance of Action under our ownership, so the confidence in the store rollouts, the use of the run rate earnings was reinforced for us.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I think actually, we've been able to develop a more relevant concept than we had when we first invested in the asset when, really, we were only able to look at more mature U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","discounters, and then some local retailers with the listings of other European and U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","-based discounters, that has allowed us to actually develop a concept which is more relevant.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I think having an eye to that was also important.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think we still think that there's plenty to do in developing the value of Action.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, there's not much to add to that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I would echo that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, clearly, we still operate with quite significant cash flows in and out, each individual transaction now is material.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I may not be the Scottish finance director, but I am the finance director that talked to you about gearing of 103%, within the sort of more recent memory.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the gearing-on-gearing within the portfolio is a real factor that we have to think about.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, clearly, the cash is very strong.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And it was with an eye at having net cash balance on the balance sheet that we wanted to be practical about the application of our dividend policy, and confirm the dividend at 20p today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we'll continue that sort of practical application.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Bill? You want to do? It's Haley Tam from Citigroup.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Two questions, please.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Firstly, you have mentioned the very buoyant realization environment, and we can see that buckets 2, 3 and 4 have fallen from over [ph] 60% of your portfolio to just 30% at the end of March '15.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Would you discourage me from thinking about that going to 0 by the end of the year, and if so, why? And I guess the follow-up question would be, in relation to that, your dividend policy in the medium-term, how should I think about that? Should that continue -- related to gross realizations or is there any chance that should shift to more of a cash flow basis? Good morning, everyone.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Welcome to 3i's results for the year to the 31st of March 2015.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've had another very active 6 months, and we have closed 3i's financial year '15, delivering some excellent returns across the group.",1446
18511,"2015m5","All 3 of our businesses have performed well, and they've all exceeded their objectives for the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's been another good year to be a shareholder in 3i, with a total return on equity of 20%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It turned out to be a very good year for realizations with total Private Equity proceeds of GBP 831 million at an average of 2x.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we have made some GBP 369 million of new investments in Private Equity.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our portfolio of Private Equity investments is maturing well, and the quality of the investments is underlined by the 19% weighted average earnings growth over the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Infrastructure provided GBP 47 million of cash income, and a 20% gross investment return.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Debt Management provided GBP 34 million of fee income, after raising a further GBP 2.",1446
18511,"2015m5","4 billion of new AUM.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As a result, group operating cash has exceeded budget, and has risen to GBP 28 million, from GBP 5 million last year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've completed our 3-year restructuring as we planned, and the 3i of today is a very different business to that it was in 2012.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's now demonstrably more resilient both commercially and financially.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've put a real focus on embedding institutional quality investment management processes throughout our 3 businesses, and our ongoing cost discipline has underpinned our transformation.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Over the last 3 years, we've met or exceeded all of our strategic priorities.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we've generated a very attractive return for shareholders, a TSR of 177% since our strategy announcement on the 28th of June 2012.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's based on a substantial increase in NAV per share at the same time that we've also achieved the balance sheet with a net cash position.",1446
18511,"2015m5","This slide shows the progress on our journey from the difficult days of 2012 to our far stronger position today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","There has been a complete transformation in our total return on opening net asset value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we've matched that with a very material reduction in the group's cost base.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our asset management initiatives, our much sharper focus in PE, have driven our solid Proprietary Capital performance.",1446
18511,"2015m5","At the same time, our cost discipline and the development of our 2 smaller businesses have removed the leakage the company was seeing from an unnecessarily large and complex cost base.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We not only paid dividends of about GBP 500 million over this period, but as I said a minute ago, we've also changed the shape of the balance sheet from GBP 464 million of net debt to GBP 49 million of net cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've done that at the same time as investing in our Infrastructure and Debt Management platforms as well as funding some very promising new investments in our Private Equity business out of Proprietary Capital.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So how will we take 3i forward from here? Well, the emphasis going forward is based on our assessment of where we can secure the best returns for shareholders.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In particular, we see mid-market Private Equity investment across our northern European and U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","platforms as giving us the best opportunity for attractive and sustainable alpha returns.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But we have to stay in the mid-market, where we believe the competition is less intense.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we have to be prepared to be patient and to pass on opportunities, where the valuation challenges our confidence in delivering a 2x return.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So because we have a strong balance sheet and we see a limited opportunity for high-return investments in today's competitive markets, we intend to fund the lion's share of new PE investment from proprietary 3i capital.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We don't think it's sensible to turn ourselves into an asset gatherer with lower return expectations, when we are choosing to focus on the mid-market where you can only put so much money to work if we maintain our price discipline.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As a result, we don't plan to raise a new buyout fund from third-party investors, at least, in the short to medium term.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Infrastructure and Debt Management will become the main drivers of third-party Fund Management growth.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And because of the extreme compression of returns in the fixed income and core infrastructure markets, we will be careful about where we put our Proprietary Capital in those 2 areas.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Once again, these results reflect the simple steps we've taken in the 3i Value Build, with all 3 of our businesses making a strong contribution to this year's results.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So now I'd like to focus on each of the 3i businesses in turn, starting with Private Equity.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's been another very good year for the team, and well done to them.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Originally, this was meant to be a relatively quiet year for realization proceeds, but we've materially exceeded our expectations.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The majority of our divestment activity is focused on our weaker assets in buckets 3 and 4, where we've recovered significant value by more active asset management over the last few years.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Although we also sold 2 high-quality bucket 2 assets earlier in the year at 2x cost, being a highlight of the DG [ph], we now have about half the investments we started with in 2012.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we aim to take this further down to between 30 and 40 companies over the next few years.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That will allow more time for active asset management as well as thoughtful origination.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have, once again, been careful investors, passing on opportunities where pricing is too aggressive and sticking close to our key sectors and geographies.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And the quality of the portfolio has improved yet again.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've sold a good number of challenged investments in this benign environment for realizations.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As a result, our stronger investments or keepers now dominate our portfolio, and this bodes very well for future value growth of 3i.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You can clearly see the quality of our current PE portfolio in the 19% weighted average earnings growth over the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And the dynamism in this portfolio is demonstrated by the EUR 400 million of bolt-on acquisitions our investee companies made over that year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As I said earlier, we have taken advantage of current pricing environment and buoyant IPO markets to move on some of our important bucket 3 assets, including Phibro, Eltel and Refresco Gerber.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that realization momentum has continued into this year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Looking at bucket 3, I am probably most pleased with the sale of Azelis, which has been a very difficult asset for 3i.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In 2012, the business was performing very poorly and running out of cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I was very reluctant to put more money into the company without some very fundamental change.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we agreed to change the Chairman, the CEO and most of the senior management team, and support a new plan for the business.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Committing to put more funding into a poorly performing company in a difficult sector, in a tough environment, is always a real challenge, especially if you happen to be the Chairman of the Investment Committee.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But our faith in the new team and in their plan has definitely paid off, with an excellent sale and recovery of value, which we completed last month.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Well done to the 3i team and the Azelis management on this one.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's been a real grind.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And they've had more than a few choice conversations with me along the way.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But they don't all come good, though, and we've had to take a write-off of some GBP 32 million on Inspecta, as its performance deteriorated on the back of the weak Finnish and Russian economies.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We wound up selling the asset for GBP 6 million after our March year end.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But let's turn to the sunny uplands at some of our keeper assets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Action continues to power on, with another fantastic performance of 30% earnings growth in 2014, and like-for-like growth of some 7%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It opened over 100 new stores, with the majority being in France and Germany, where the concept has been very well received by consumers.",1446
18511,"2015m5","This year, they will embark on an even more ambitious store opening program.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Scandlines has also enjoyed a strong year, with good EBITDA growth and a very successful and value-accretive sale of their H-H joint venture.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The prospects for 2015 looks sound, and it's clear from the comments of various parties involved that delays are more likely to the completion of the tunnel, which will ultimately compete with Scandlines' main route between Rødby and Puttgarden.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And by the way, we are intending to bring the management of Scandlines and Basic-Fit to London on June 15 for an investor and analyst presentation.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've again been very active in the new investment market as well as supporting a good number of bolt-on acquisitions for our portfolio companies.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In fact, we've committed GBP 368 million, but pricing took a number of targets out of our reach, and we're determined to maintain our price discipline in the current environment, even if that means lower levels of realization of investment for a period of time.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Infrastructure team delivered a strong year, with a gross investment return of 20%, driven by a total shareholder return of 25% at 3iN.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And they earned a performance fee of GBP 45 million, based on 3iN's strong NAV growth and the sale of Eversholt.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The new investment market across the Infrastructure segment has seen some very rich prices paid for super core assets, well beyond our appetite.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But we did continue to source some good quality primary PPP investments as well as further medium-sized core -- a further medium-sized core investment with Oiltanking.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The very successful sale of Eversholt was one of a series of recent transactions in the sector where very high prices have been paid.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Fortunately for us, 3iN owns a quality portfolio of core assets which were assembled in a very different environment to the one we see today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Today's environment could be characterized as a land grab for a limited supply of available super core assets by investors such as sovereign wealth funds, who often have a very long time horizon and who are struggling to find long-term yield in today's traditional investment markets in fixed income.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And in the light of these tightening market conditions, 3iN has decided to update its own return objectives and dividend policy, as you can see here.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I know our team is very focused on where they can find further core investments, away from those large super core assets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Debt Management team has also had a very productive year, with strong CLO issuance and good new product developments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","They are now beginning to make an important contribution to the group's economics, and the profitability of the Fund Management business, in particular.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have delivered another large shift in capital efficiency and capital allocation, with a material reduction in operating and interest costs, making more cash available for shareholder distributions and investment.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as a result of our strong realizations and healthy balance sheet, we're announcing today a final dividend of 14p per share.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That gives us a total of 20p for FY '15.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's a yield of 5% on our opening share price of 398p.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we've had another very good year to finish our 3-year restructuring phase.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've met or exceeded all the targets we set ourselves as well as continuing to sell assets at good premiums to book value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We enter this new phase for 3i in much better and resilient shape.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We continue to sell investments of group premiums to book value, and the remaining portfolio is generally of much higher quality.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And this portfolio, with earnings growth of 19%, was valued at 10.",1446
18511,"2015m5","5x EBITDA at the 31st of March, compared to 14.",1446
18511,"2015m5","6x EBITDA for the FTSE 250 Index.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The group itself now benefits from a flexible and cost-effective investment platform and a balance sheet with net cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have clarity within the group about how we aim to develop our business going forward, and our investment teams are now performing in asset management terms, just as well as any of their rivals in the markets they operate in.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Now I'd like to close by saying, as an investment business, we're susceptible to broad economic and political trends as well as regulatory change in financial services.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And while we see a general recovery across many of the markets we operate in, we are mindful that a big part of this recovery is still very fragile.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And there are some worrying bubbles building up in various asset markets because of the current monetary market conditions.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So as a result, we intend to remain careful in our approach to new investment, while we actively manage our existing portfolio and take advantage of buoyant realization markets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Quality and thoughtful origination will be key, and we are recruiting further origination talent across our international platform.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's really encouraging that 3i is once again performing as it should in its 70th year since the original foundation of the business.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And it's exciting that there's still so much more to be done.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So on that note, I'll pass over to Julia, who will give you more details and color on the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","There are some mics at the back.",1446
18511,"2015m5","They'll bring them up to you.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Philip? When we gave that guidance, we were coming from a position where the group had been seeing about GBP 100 million of operating cost leakage a year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the other big factor that's clearly changed is we're making an operating cash surplus out of the current business.",1446
18511,"2015m5","On the realizations, I'd love to think it would -- well, particularly, the bottom 2 buckets go to 0, but I think that's unlikely.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think we're always going to have a ragbag around at the bottom.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But it'll be de minimis in terms of value, ultimately.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So it won't be, in any way, a real driver or drag on the growth coming out of our portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I would expect to see this trend continue quite strongly over the next couple of years, even if it doesn't quite get to 0.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In terms of dividend policy, maybe I'll make a comment and then Julia can pick this up, I would say we gave a guidance back in 2012, '13 to reassure shareholders that we were going to be providing meaningful cash dividends going forward, the 15% to 20% of realizations.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that's what we've used.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's been a guidance for that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But if you look at 3i today, I think it is a strong cash machine going forward.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So whether we're a slave to that original dividend guidance or whether we tipped slightly over it, as we did today, I think these are nice problems to have that we'll address as we come to them.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just wondering whether you could give a bit of guidance on what's happened ever since the 31st of March, basically, in terms of sort of the amount of realizations that you've agreed, that haven't yet completed, what the uplifts might be on there and the FX effect? I think we'd like to be up to EUR 750 million-type of new investment.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's where we'd like to be out of Proprietary Capital.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we can feed that very easily.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But I'll just repeat, we're not going to go there, if it means opening the filters 1 iota.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we'll only go there if we're completely comfortable with the pricing.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Yes? Yes, I think that's right.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've -- in terms of modeling, you should keep using the guidance that we've given.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But we've shown ourselves to be practical in the upper cage [ph].",1446
18511,"2015m5","Once we've gone through our criteria, we've been practical in the way that we've applied it, both last year and this year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So -- but for now, I would continue to use 15% -- 15% to 20% when you're modeling, and at 20%, which is what we said, when investment levels are below where would like to be.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just 2 questions, please.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the first one is just thinking about the earnings growth in the underlying portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's been strong for quite a while now, and I don't mean this to come across the wrong way, but how much of that is 3i management and how much of that is just because the companies are in structural growth industries? And I guess, following on from that, how sustainable is that earnings growth momentum, do you think? And then my second question is just on the investment side.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You mentioned you don't really want to, as a business, keep just sort of gathering cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So how should we think about like a run rate investment number now, or how do you -- I should say, how do you think about 3i's investments in terms of the run rate? Philip Middleton, Merrill Lynch.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Obviously, these are fantastic results which are well done.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just a couple of questions arising out of those.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Firstly, you talked about the investment pipeline.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Could you tell us a bit more about what you're seeing in terms of valuation there and, in particular, are there any geographical distinctions or are there any sectoral distinctions or any areas where you feel you've got the particular edge that's enabling you to compete? Because that, presumably, will be key in the next 1 or 2 years.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Secondly, on the balance sheet, I can entirely understand why you're backing away from the balance sheet structure you had in certain other areas.",1446
18511,"2015m5","0% is a bit off, is slightly conservative, though, when you look at where -- what, for example, Intermediate Capital is doing, when you look at what some of the other companies like Wendel's doing, I just wondered what modeling you've done to determine that 0% is a good number? Okay.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Let me have a go.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, in terms of the earnings growth, I think this really splits down.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So ultimately, it's the management of these businesses that really determine the strength of the earnings growth, whether it be an Azelis or whether it be an Action.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But the 3i teams are very knowledgeable and engaged shareholders, so they can be very good at prompting change and also making judgments that use our other experiences in the past or across the portfolio to help management tackle market challenges.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And in particular, our own style is to help businesses internationalize.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And again, we have a lot of experience in internationalizing these mid-sized companies and bringing contacts and other benefits to those management.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the fundamental driver, particularly of the better company is down, I would say in the main, to them being good companies in interesting sectors with strong management teams and a very engaged shareholder.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've been more hands-on and more active in the problem companies, where we've seen a very significant turnaround from negative earnings momentum to, in some cases, really quite positive earnings momentum.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that's involved a great deal of time from the 3i executives involved in them.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, is it sustainable? I suppose what we have seen a broadly is a pickup in confidence in the overall environment over the last 6 months, in particular, really since the European Central Bank started signaling that QE was going to be the order of the day.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So that was quite noticeable across much of the portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I think the better companies will continue to prosper.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Fortunately, for us, the better companies now dominate the value of the portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we're anticipating another healthy year coming out of this portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We don't see any dramatic change or anything like that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The last point was the investment point? Just a couple.",1446
18511,"2015m5","One, sort of, I guess following on from Philip's question is, I guess, no process is purely proprietary.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So where you do have to compete in auctions, are you paying the top price? Or are you able to bring some kind of edge into play? You have a network, your experience in internationalizing businesses, et cetera.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And just on Action, increasing it by a turn, was that you're decision or was that taken in discussion, I guess, with the auditors, given your previous comments on the valuation of that asset? Thank you, Simon.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So as Simon has confirmed, we have consistently met or exceeded the objectives we set for ourselves for the 3 years since 2012.",1446
18511,"2015m5","These results give you further evidence of the progress that we've made in building value for our shareholders.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Importantly, the results show how all 3 of our businesses are performing well.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just to be clear, I will, again, be referring to our investment basis numbers rather than our audited statutory results.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As usual, I've included a reconciliation between the 2 sets of numbers in the pack.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The total return and NAV are the same under each basis.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our results show how we are building value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You can see the excellent performance from our portfolio of investments in the 19% increase in Private Equity portfolio earnings, which underpinned the GBP 684 million value growth.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We generated a good flow of realizations, delivering proceeds of GBP 841 million, and a money multiple of 2x.",1446
18511,"2015m5","When you exclude refinancings, the uplift over book value was 27%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have a significantly more robust and efficient platform, and our cash operating profit increased from GBP 5 million to GBP 28 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Fund Management business has delivered an underlying operating profit of GBP 33 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as Simon said, our balance sheet is sound, and we have funded GBP 474 million of total cash investments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The strength of realizations and the significant reduction in cash leakage from cost and interests, have allowed us to close the year with no gearing.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The model is working well.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that's why we have announced a total dividend for the year of 20p per share.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We closed the year with NAV per share of 396p, up 14% on last year, and a total return of 20%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's great results.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You can see on this slide the positive contribution that we've had from both value growth and realized profits.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The impact of the reduction in our cost base and interest build means that the dilution of those returns is significantly lower.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The net carry payable is a direct cost of the strong portfolio performance that we've delivered.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Currency was volatile throughout the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In the end, the net translation effect of a strong U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","dollar and a weaker euro took 12p off NAV.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I've given you the updated sensitivities and the breakdown of net assets by currency in the back of the pack, so you can continue to track these effects.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Finally, we paid 6p of our proposed 20p total dividend in January.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Together with last year's final dividend, that results in the 19p that you can see here.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As you've seen, all 3 of our businesses contributed to the strong performance in the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I'll focus on the individual businesses first before covering the group KPIs in more detail.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Private Equity has had a very good year, generating a gross investment return of GBP 719 million, and that's after FX, or 24% of opening portfolio value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've reduced the portfolio to 65 investments at the year end, right in line with our longer-term aim to reduce to less than 40 assets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And while the overall number of companies in the portfolio -- reducing the overall number of companies in the portfolio, we've generated realized profits of GBP 144 million, and an uplift of 27% over opening value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we've reshaped the portfolio towards what we call our keeper assets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Of the GBP 830 million cash proceeds that we received from Private Equity, GBP 155 million was the result of our decision to take advantage of favorable debt markets to refinance some of our strongest and cash-generative investments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Here, I'm talking about Action, Element and Amor.",1446
18511,"2015m5","When there is a refinancing, cash is usually returned to us by repayment of shareholder loans, which means there's little or no uplift on those proceeds.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In total, we fully sold 19 assets, generating GBP 456 million of proceeds as well as realizing good returns from investments such as Hilite, a 31% IRR and a 2.",1446
18511,"2015m5","1x money multiple; and Vedici, a 48% uplift and another 2x money multiple.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We also sold a 12 investments, which had an individual book values of less than GBP 5 million each, at the 31st of March 2014.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Bouyant Equity Markets meant we were able to IPO 4 companies: Phibro in the U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","in April, D.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Phone in China in July; they were followed by Eltel in Stockholm; and Refresco in Amsterdam towards the end of the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We completely sold down our investments in Phibro during the year, and we realized GBP 273 million in proceeds from IPOs and quota sales.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as at the 31st of March 2015, our quota portfolio had a closing value of GBP 273 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Realizations and our cash to cash returns are the ultimate measure of our success.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But in the meantime, the value growth in our portfolio gives you evidence of the progress that we are making.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Value-weighted earnings growth was 19% for the 33 companies that we value on an earnings basis.",1446
18511,"2015m5","By comparison, that measure was 9% 3 years ago.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And although the 19% and the 9% are not directly comparable, what they do show is the improvement in the portfolio mix, the buckets that we talked about.",1446
18511,"2015m5","At the 31st of March 2012, 22% of the portfolio value was in 31 companies with negative earnings growth.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Now 3 years later, only 7% by value of the portfolio, or 7 companies, have negative growth.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the strong performance of our keepers and our more recent investments are not being diluted.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Action makes a significant contribution to this measure of earnings growth because it's our largest investment and it's growing at 30%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","If you take out Action, the growth is 16%, which is still very respectable.",1446
18511,"2015m5","All our most recent investments are included in the calculation, and about 2% of the total growth comes from the 20-or-so acquisitions made by our portfolio companies, and substantially funded from their own resources.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's the effect of the portfolio dynamism that Simon talked about.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The growth flows through to the unrealized value growth in what we call performance of GBP 417 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That strong performance also reflects the fact that we have only used lower forecast earnings for 2 portfolio companies, with a total value of GBP 63 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's down from 4 companies valued at GBP 99 million last year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Now in the past, I've talked about the approach we take to setting multiples and the effect that approach has on our valuations, especially when Equity Markets are so high.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We monitor comparable quota companies, but we are also guided by our exit expectations and the longer-term cycle or sector trends.",1446
18511,"2015m5","With the FTSE 100 around 7,000 and the average multiple of our relevant global market indices increasing by over 16% in the year, and 12% in the last quarter alone, we adjusted the multiples we used in 70% of cases.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We still recorded a GBP 64 million increase in value from multiple expansion, and that was mostly due to our decision to increase the multiple we used to value Action, from 12.",1446
18511,"2015m5","5x post-discount to 13.",1446
18511,"2015m5","If we exclude Action, the value-weighted average post-discount multiple is 9.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Simon mentioned our investments in Scandlines.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As well as good performance, the valuation has also increased because we have extended our assumption about the opening date of the competing tunnel.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Scandlines is the main contributor to the increase in the DCF category.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The imminent sale category includes Azelis, Touchtunes, Inspecta and Soya.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The sale of Azelis is an excellent outcome.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Its value at the 31st of March was GBP 26 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We completed the transaction last week, and expect to receive proceeds of GBP 66 million shortly.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that GBP 66 million is fully reflected in the value at the 31st of March 2015.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The performance of our quota portfolio reflects the investment's good performance and positive equity market sentiment.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Finally, on the portfolio, here are the top 20 Private Equity investments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","They account for 79% of the portfolio, and are generally trending with a positive outlook.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The strong performance of the portfolio and our realizations mean an increase in the amount that we accrue for carried interest payable to the investment team.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The majority of our Private Equity investments are now held in carry schemes that have met their performance hurdle, assuming we sold everything today at book value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we now expect to accrue carry payable at between 10% to 15% of the gross investment return.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And it's only paid out when the hurdle is met with cash returns.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As you can see, we paid GBP 7 million in cash in the period.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The multiples for Eurofund V and the growth capital fund have now increased to 1.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The 2010 to 2012 assets in Eurofund V, which include Action, continued to perform well.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But at the fund level, we also include the 2007 to 2009 investments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we remain below the performance hurdle, and that means we are not recognizing carry receivable for this fund.",1446
18511,"2015m5","During the year, the growth capital fund has passed its performance hurdle on a valuation basis.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we've now recognized GBP 25 million of carry receivable from this fund.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So this has been another strong year for Private Equity, the biggest contributor and now a solid foundation for our NAV progression.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Infrastructure business contributes to our returns through our 34% investment in 3i Infrastructure plc, and through the profitability of its Funds Management and advisory activity.",1446
18511,"2015m5","There has been a step change in Infrastructure's contribution through gross investment return.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's because the share price of 3iN increased by 19% to 160p, which together with dividend income, contributed to a total shareholder return of 25%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","3iN announced its results on Tuesday, and they reported a 24.",1446
18511,"2015m5","6% return as a result of the sale of Eversholt Rail and significant valuation uplifts on its core European portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As well as the advisory fee, we earn an NAV-based performance fee.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as a result of 3iN's strong performance in the year, we expect to receive a fee of GBP 45 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","75% of that has been set aside for the investment team, in line with the arrangements that were put in place at the time of 3iN's listing.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've introduced a significant element of deferral in these performance rewards, and we will award a substantial proportion over at least 3 to 5 years.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that will be in line with the principles of the compensation review that we completed in 2013.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Debt Management business is principally a Funds Management platform.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our teams at both the U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","and Europe, had a very good year of fundraising.",1446
18511,"2015m5","During the year, Debt Management closed 6 new CLOs in Europe and the U.",1446
18511,"2015m5",", and the team launched a new mid-market loan fund in Europe.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Those CLOs and new fund added GBP 2.",1446
18511,"2015m5","4 billion to our AUM, which more than offset the runoff in the older European funds.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we've finished the year with assets under management of GBP 7.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We invested GBP 105 million of our Proprietary Capital in Debt Management, split between GBP 26 million in warehouses that will seed future CLO launches, and GBP 79 million in the CLOs that we've actually launched.",1446
18511,"2015m5","After divestments, we had 160 -- GBP 176 million of value invested in Debt Management products.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Ignoring capital flows, there was a net value reduction of GBP 25 million this year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Almost 2/3 of that GBP 25 million was the result of distributions paid.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But there were also some short-term mark-to-market volatility in the valuation of recent CLO issues.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Fee income increased to GBP 34 million, and if we include portfolio income, the business generated GBP 56 million of cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So all 3 businesses contributed to the strong performance, and that is borne out by our strong set of KPIs.",1446
18511,"2015m5","At the group level, we have achieved an annual cash operating profit of GBP 28 million, and that's a very real increase from our first time profit of GBP 5 million in 2014.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've also made progress in generating operating income from both our fund and asset management activities, while staying highly disciplined on costs.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Operating expenses, excluding restructuring costs, have increased by 2%, mainly due to increased variable compensation, as business performance has improved and AUM increased by 4%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As we finished the period of restructuring and transition, we have started some recruitment to support investment activity in all 3 business lines.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But we remain totally focused on cost discipline, and we expect costs to stay at around 1% of AUM.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have a strong balance sheet and our financial performance during the year has strengthened this even further.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We finished the year with net cash of GBP 49 million and gross debt of GBP 815 million, made up of our bonds due in 2017, 2023 and 2032.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We refinanced the RCF in September, extending its maturity to 2019, with the potential to extend out to 2020 and 2021.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Liquidity is also strong.",1446
18511,"2015m5","GBP 864 million of the GBP 1.",1446
18511,"2015m5","2 billion is now cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In 2012, we talked about a target capital allocation model that would increase the funds available for future investments and enhance distribution to shareholders.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As Simon said, today, we have proposed a 20p dividend for the year, which equates to a final dividend of 14p.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's ahead of our expected range of 15% to 20% of gross cash realization proceeds, but it reflects the board's confidence in both the performance of the business and the strength of the balance sheet.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Of the 14p proposed, 5.",1446
18511,"2015m5","4p is the final base dividend and 8.",1446
18511,"2015m5","6p is the additional dividend.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So our performance in FY 2015 was strong.",1446
18511,"2015m5","All 3 businesses are performing well, and our results provide further evidence of the progress that we have made since 2012.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Thank you very much, and Simon and I will now be happy to take questions.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Yes, that's fine.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Well, I talked -- I gave you the names of the ones that are on the imminent sale category, which is Azelis, Inspecta, Touchtunes and Soya, and they're effectively all, more or less, all baked into the numbers.",1446
18511,"2015m5","There's a small difference, potentially, on those.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that's roughly about GBP 130 million that we would expect to get in.",1446
18511,"2015m5","FX has not been my friend since the 31st of March, particularly, post the election results.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the last time I looked, that looked like another GBP 60 million, principally, due -- well, both due to euro and dollar.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as I said, in the back of the pack, you'll see the 1% sensitivities that we've had on FX since the March balance sheet day.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Any other questions? Great, okay.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Thanks for coming today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Good to see you all.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And then on the decision to change the multiple on Action, I mean, it won't surprise you to know that there's a fair amount of attention during the audit process and the valuation process on the valuation of Action.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But I'd say, there were sort of a number of drivers.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've had another year of strong performance of Action under our ownership, so the confidence in the store rollouts, the use of the run rate earnings was reinforced for us.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I think actually, we've been able to develop a more relevant concept than we had when we first invested in the asset when, really, we were only able to look at more mature U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","discounters, and then some local retailers with the listings of other European and U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","-based discounters, that has allowed us to actually develop a concept which is more relevant.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I think having an eye to that was also important.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think we still think that there's plenty to do in developing the value of Action.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just a couple.",1446
18511,"2015m5","One, sort of, I guess following on from Philip's question is, I guess, no process is purely proprietary.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So where you do have to compete in auctions, are you paying the top price? Or are you able to bring some kind of edge into play? You have a network, your experience in internationalizing businesses, et cetera.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And just on Action, increasing it by a turn, was that you're decision or was that taken in discussion, I guess, with the auditors, given your previous comments on the valuation of that asset? Chris Brown from JPMorgan Cazenove.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just wondering whether you could give a bit of guidance on what's happened ever since the 31st of March, basically, in terms of sort of the amount of realizations that you've agreed, that haven't yet completed, what the uplifts might be on there and the FX effect? Philip Middleton, Merrill Lynch.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Obviously, these are fantastic results which are well done.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just a couple of questions arising out of those.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Firstly, you talked about the investment pipeline.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Could you tell us a bit more about what you're seeing in terms of valuation there and, in particular, are there any geographical distinctions or are there any sectoral distinctions or any areas where you feel you've got the particular edge that's enabling you to compete? Because that, presumably, will be key in the next 1 or 2 years.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Secondly, on the balance sheet, I can entirely understand why you're backing away from the balance sheet structure you had in certain other areas.",1446
18511,"2015m5","0% is a bit off, is slightly conservative, though, when you look at where -- what, for example, Intermediate Capital is doing, when you look at what some of the other companies like Wendel's doing, I just wondered what modeling you've done to determine that 0% is a good number? Any other questions? Great, okay.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Thanks for coming today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Good to see you all.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Good morning, everyone.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Welcome to 3i's results for the year to the 31st of March 2015.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've had another very active 6 months, and we have closed 3i's financial year '15, delivering some excellent returns across the group.",1446
18511,"2015m5","All 3 of our businesses have performed well, and they've all exceeded their objectives for the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's been another good year to be a shareholder in 3i, with a total return on equity of 20%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It turned out to be a very good year for realizations with total Private Equity proceeds of GBP 831 million at an average of 2x.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we have made some GBP 369 million of new investments in Private Equity.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our portfolio of Private Equity investments is maturing well, and the quality of the investments is underlined by the 19% weighted average earnings growth over the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Infrastructure provided GBP 47 million of cash income, and a 20% gross investment return.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Debt Management provided GBP 34 million of fee income, after raising a further GBP 2.",1446
18511,"2015m5","4 billion of new AUM.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As a result, group operating cash has exceeded budget, and has risen to GBP 28 million, from GBP 5 million last year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've completed our 3-year restructuring as we planned, and the 3i of today is a very different business to that it was in 2012.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's now demonstrably more resilient both commercially and financially.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've put a real focus on embedding institutional quality investment management processes throughout our 3 businesses, and our ongoing cost discipline has underpinned our transformation.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Over the last 3 years, we've met or exceeded all of our strategic priorities.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we've generated a very attractive return for shareholders, a TSR of 177% since our strategy announcement on the 28th of June 2012.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's based on a substantial increase in NAV per share at the same time that we've also achieved the balance sheet with a net cash position.",1446
18511,"2015m5","This slide shows the progress on our journey from the difficult days of 2012 to our far stronger position today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","There has been a complete transformation in our total return on opening net asset value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we've matched that with a very material reduction in the group's cost base.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our asset management initiatives, our much sharper focus in PE, have driven our solid Proprietary Capital performance.",1446
18511,"2015m5","At the same time, our cost discipline and the development of our 2 smaller businesses have removed the leakage the company was seeing from an unnecessarily large and complex cost base.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We not only paid dividends of about GBP 500 million over this period, but as I said a minute ago, we've also changed the shape of the balance sheet from GBP 464 million of net debt to GBP 49 million of net cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've done that at the same time as investing in our Infrastructure and Debt Management platforms as well as funding some very promising new investments in our Private Equity business out of Proprietary Capital.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So how will we take 3i forward from here? Well, the emphasis going forward is based on our assessment of where we can secure the best returns for shareholders.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In particular, we see mid-market Private Equity investment across our northern European and U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","platforms as giving us the best opportunity for attractive and sustainable alpha returns.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But we have to stay in the mid-market, where we believe the competition is less intense.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we have to be prepared to be patient and to pass on opportunities, where the valuation challenges our confidence in delivering a 2x return.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So because we have a strong balance sheet and we see a limited opportunity for high-return investments in today's competitive markets, we intend to fund the lion's share of new PE investment from proprietary 3i capital.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We don't think it's sensible to turn ourselves into an asset gatherer with lower return expectations, when we are choosing to focus on the mid-market where you can only put so much money to work if we maintain our price discipline.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As a result, we don't plan to raise a new buyout fund from third-party investors, at least, in the short to medium term.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Infrastructure and Debt Management will become the main drivers of third-party Fund Management growth.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And because of the extreme compression of returns in the fixed income and core infrastructure markets, we will be careful about where we put our Proprietary Capital in those 2 areas.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Once again, these results reflect the simple steps we've taken in the 3i Value Build, with all 3 of our businesses making a strong contribution to this year's results.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So now I'd like to focus on each of the 3i businesses in turn, starting with Private Equity.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's been another very good year for the team, and well done to them.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Originally, this was meant to be a relatively quiet year for realization proceeds, but we've materially exceeded our expectations.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The majority of our divestment activity is focused on our weaker assets in buckets 3 and 4, where we've recovered significant value by more active asset management over the last few years.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Although we also sold 2 high-quality bucket 2 assets earlier in the year at 2x cost, being a highlight of the DG [ph], we now have about half the investments we started with in 2012.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we aim to take this further down to between 30 and 40 companies over the next few years.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That will allow more time for active asset management as well as thoughtful origination.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have, once again, been careful investors, passing on opportunities where pricing is too aggressive and sticking close to our key sectors and geographies.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And the quality of the portfolio has improved yet again.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've sold a good number of challenged investments in this benign environment for realizations.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As a result, our stronger investments or keepers now dominate our portfolio, and this bodes very well for future value growth of 3i.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You can clearly see the quality of our current PE portfolio in the 19% weighted average earnings growth over the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And the dynamism in this portfolio is demonstrated by the EUR 400 million of bolt-on acquisitions our investee companies made over that year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As I said earlier, we have taken advantage of current pricing environment and buoyant IPO markets to move on some of our important bucket 3 assets, including Phibro, Eltel and Refresco Gerber.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that realization momentum has continued into this year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Looking at bucket 3, I am probably most pleased with the sale of Azelis, which has been a very difficult asset for 3i.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In 2012, the business was performing very poorly and running out of cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I was very reluctant to put more money into the company without some very fundamental change.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we agreed to change the Chairman, the CEO and most of the senior management team, and support a new plan for the business.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Committing to put more funding into a poorly performing company in a difficult sector, in a tough environment, is always a real challenge, especially if you happen to be the Chairman of the Investment Committee.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But our faith in the new team and in their plan has definitely paid off, with an excellent sale and recovery of value, which we completed last month.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Well done to the 3i team and the Azelis management on this one.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's been a real grind.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And they've had more than a few choice conversations with me along the way.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But they don't all come good, though, and we've had to take a write-off of some GBP 32 million on Inspecta, as its performance deteriorated on the back of the weak Finnish and Russian economies.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We wound up selling the asset for GBP 6 million after our March year end.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But let's turn to the sunny uplands at some of our keeper assets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Action continues to power on, with another fantastic performance of 30% earnings growth in 2014, and like-for-like growth of some 7%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It opened over 100 new stores, with the majority being in France and Germany, where the concept has been very well received by consumers.",1446
18511,"2015m5","This year, they will embark on an even more ambitious store opening program.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Scandlines has also enjoyed a strong year, with good EBITDA growth and a very successful and value-accretive sale of their H-H joint venture.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The prospects for 2015 looks sound, and it's clear from the comments of various parties involved that delays are more likely to the completion of the tunnel, which will ultimately compete with Scandlines' main route between Rødby and Puttgarden.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And by the way, we are intending to bring the management of Scandlines and Basic-Fit to London on June 15 for an investor and analyst presentation.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've again been very active in the new investment market as well as supporting a good number of bolt-on acquisitions for our portfolio companies.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In fact, we've committed GBP 368 million, but pricing took a number of targets out of our reach, and we're determined to maintain our price discipline in the current environment, even if that means lower levels of realization of investment for a period of time.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Infrastructure team delivered a strong year, with a gross investment return of 20%, driven by a total shareholder return of 25% at 3iN.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And they earned a performance fee of GBP 45 million, based on 3iN's strong NAV growth and the sale of Eversholt.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The new investment market across the Infrastructure segment has seen some very rich prices paid for super core assets, well beyond our appetite.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But we did continue to source some good quality primary PPP investments as well as further medium-sized core -- a further medium-sized core investment with Oiltanking.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The very successful sale of Eversholt was one of a series of recent transactions in the sector where very high prices have been paid.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Fortunately for us, 3iN owns a quality portfolio of core assets which were assembled in a very different environment to the one we see today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Today's environment could be characterized as a land grab for a limited supply of available super core assets by investors such as sovereign wealth funds, who often have a very long time horizon and who are struggling to find long-term yield in today's traditional investment markets in fixed income.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And in the light of these tightening market conditions, 3iN has decided to update its own return objectives and dividend policy, as you can see here.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I know our team is very focused on where they can find further core investments, away from those large super core assets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Debt Management team has also had a very productive year, with strong CLO issuance and good new product developments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","They are now beginning to make an important contribution to the group's economics, and the profitability of the Fund Management business, in particular.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have delivered another large shift in capital efficiency and capital allocation, with a material reduction in operating and interest costs, making more cash available for shareholder distributions and investment.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as a result of our strong realizations and healthy balance sheet, we're announcing today a final dividend of 14p per share.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That gives us a total of 20p for FY '15.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's a yield of 5% on our opening share price of 398p.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we've had another very good year to finish our 3-year restructuring phase.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've met or exceeded all the targets we set ourselves as well as continuing to sell assets at good premiums to book value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We enter this new phase for 3i in much better and resilient shape.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We continue to sell investments of group premiums to book value, and the remaining portfolio is generally of much higher quality.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And this portfolio, with earnings growth of 19%, was valued at 10.",1446
18511,"2015m5","5x EBITDA at the 31st of March, compared to 14.",1446
18511,"2015m5","6x EBITDA for the FTSE 250 Index.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The group itself now benefits from a flexible and cost-effective investment platform and a balance sheet with net cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have clarity within the group about how we aim to develop our business going forward, and our investment teams are now performing in asset management terms, just as well as any of their rivals in the markets they operate in.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Now I'd like to close by saying, as an investment business, we're susceptible to broad economic and political trends as well as regulatory change in financial services.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And while we see a general recovery across many of the markets we operate in, we are mindful that a big part of this recovery is still very fragile.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And there are some worrying bubbles building up in various asset markets because of the current monetary market conditions.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So as a result, we intend to remain careful in our approach to new investment, while we actively manage our existing portfolio and take advantage of buoyant realization markets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Quality and thoughtful origination will be key, and we are recruiting further origination talent across our international platform.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's really encouraging that 3i is once again performing as it should in its 70th year since the original foundation of the business.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And it's exciting that there's still so much more to be done.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So on that note, I'll pass over to Julia, who will give you more details and color on the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","[indiscernible] I think we'd like to be up to EUR 750 million-type of new investment.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's where we'd like to be out of Proprietary Capital.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we can feed that very easily.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But I'll just repeat, we're not going to go there, if it means opening the filters 1 iota.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we'll only go there if we're completely comfortable with the pricing.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Yes? Yes, I think that's right.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've -- in terms of modeling, you should keep using the guidance that we've given.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But we've shown ourselves to be practical in the upper cage [ph].",1446
18511,"2015m5","Once we've gone through our criteria, we've been practical in the way that we've applied it, both last year and this year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So -- but for now, I would continue to use 15% -- 15% to 20% when you're modeling, and at 20%, which is what we said, when investment levels are below where would like to be.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, there's not much to add to that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I would echo that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, clearly, we still operate with quite significant cash flows in and out, each individual transaction now is material.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I may not be the Scottish finance director, but I am the finance director that talked to you about gearing of 103%, within the sort of more recent memory.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the gearing-on-gearing within the portfolio is a real factor that we have to think about.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, clearly, the cash is very strong.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And it was with an eye at having net cash balance on the balance sheet that we wanted to be practical about the application of our dividend policy, and confirm the dividend at 20p today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we'll continue that sort of practical application.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's Anil Sharma from Morgan Stanley.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just 2 questions, please.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the first one is just thinking about the earnings growth in the underlying portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's been strong for quite a while now, and I don't mean this to come across the wrong way, but how much of that is 3i management and how much of that is just because the companies are in structural growth industries? And I guess, following on from that, how sustainable is that earnings growth momentum, do you think? And then my second question is just on the investment side.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You mentioned you don't really want to, as a business, keep just sort of gathering cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So how should we think about like a run rate investment number now, or how do you -- I should say, how do you think about 3i's investments in terms of the run rate? Yes, that's fine.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Well, I talked -- I gave you the names of the ones that are on the imminent sale category, which is Azelis, Inspecta, Touchtunes and Soya, and they're effectively all, more or less, all baked into the numbers.",1446
18511,"2015m5","There's a small difference, potentially, on those.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that's roughly about GBP 130 million that we would expect to get in.",1446
18511,"2015m5","FX has not been my friend since the 31st of March, particularly, post the election results.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the last time I looked, that looked like another GBP 60 million, principally, due -- well, both due to euro and dollar.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as I said, in the back of the pack, you'll see the 1% sensitivities that we've had on FX since the March balance sheet day.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Okay, I'll take the first.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I'll make 1 comment about the second, but Julia will, no doubt, want to talk about that as well.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, in terms of the investment pipeline, the WIP, as we call it, is pretty busy.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It is reflecting opportunities across our key geographies of North America and northern Europe.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's very much in those sectors that we like.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It is big and it's -- in terms of range of size, so I would think it varies between equity checks of GBP 50 million and GBP 175 million, in terms of size of potential investments, from our point of view.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And clearly, some of those processes are what I would call more proprietorial than general, and where we find ourselves, for one reason or another, in the more proprietorial process, it obviously ultimately leads to a better pricing dynamic, I would say.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In general, it's a very competitive process.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We're careful about how much money we spend on due diligence before we get a better sense of where the pricing is going to be move to.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I think this is one of these things where the crystal ball is very hard to say at the moment.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The good things are that the WIP is wide, there's lots to look at.",1446
18511,"2015m5","All the teams are more focused on origination than asset management because we have the portfolio, generally, in much better shape, the existing portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But how many we pull the trigger on ultimately, because of pricing, is very hard for me to say today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But there are some coming to investment committee, which we're -- obviously, we're very interested in.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I think the outlook for investment gradually improves, but it's always dependent on the market and whether there's some Herbert out there who's going to pay us a silly price for that particular asset or not.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think on the balance sheet, what I would say, as the bank that helped draw up the 3i prospectus in 1994, we -- at that time, we had a Scottish CEO at 3i, called Ewen MacPherson, who is a very strong CEO of the business, and we debated aggressively about the capital structure.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we came to the very simple position that there was enough debt in the portfolio, we didn't need more in the center.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Because when the portfolio went the wrong way, we would need resources to support the portfolio because of the gearing in the portfolio, which averaged similar amounts of gearing to what we see today.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So that was the wisdom.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And philosophically, I haven't moved a long way from that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think it holds as well today as it did then.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I'm not sure we want to travel with large amounts of cash, but having a degree of liquidity and little of our own debt to worry about does put us in a very good position to pull the trigger on helping our own companies in a downcycle or a shock, and actually going after some very interesting investments, should that happen.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I think, should that happen, we're in a much better position to capitalize on that now.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You want to do? It's Haley Tam from Citigroup.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Two questions, please.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Firstly, you have mentioned the very buoyant realization environment, and we can see that buckets 2, 3 and 4 have fallen from over [ph] 60% of your portfolio to just 30% at the end of March '15.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Would you discourage me from thinking about that going to 0 by the end of the year, and if so, why? And I guess the follow-up question would be, in relation to that, your dividend policy in the medium-term, how should I think about that? Should that continue -- related to gross realizations or is there any chance that should shift to more of a cash flow basis? Okay.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Well, maybe Julia can take the second question, I'll deal with the first.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think we come out of auctions pretty well, if the clearing price in the auction is a sensible price.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So both American assets and Aspen Pumps were auctions, they were quite narrow auctions and, ultimately, once the price got to a certain point, the influence of management in who they'd rather travel with going forward becomes very important.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And I think our team do a really good job at getting alongside management and convincing them that the approach of 3i and the longer-term perspective that we have about investing, is a very good place for them to join, if you like.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So all 3 of those businesses were in auctions.",1446
18511,"2015m5","All 3 of those business, we bought at prices we're very comfortable with.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But in the end, it came down to choice of management as to who they chose, and they chose us.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I think that's the sort of performance we like to see when we're in an auction process.",1446
18511,"2015m5","If it's just about price, and as I said there is a Herbert or 2 in there, then we're not going to play in that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think, Christ, on the other hand, we had very good insight into that business because of Amor.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So although that may have been dressed up as an auction, it was pretty clear to us we had a very powerful position and we were able to lock that investment down pretty early on in the process.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Thank you, Simon.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So as Simon has confirmed, we have consistently met or exceeded the objectives we set for ourselves for the 3 years since 2012.",1446
18511,"2015m5","These results give you further evidence of the progress that we've made in building value for our shareholders.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Importantly, the results show how all 3 of our businesses are performing well.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Just to be clear, I will, again, be referring to our investment basis numbers rather than our audited statutory results.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As usual, I've included a reconciliation between the 2 sets of numbers in the pack.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The total return and NAV are the same under each basis.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our results show how we are building value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You can see the excellent performance from our portfolio of investments in the 19% increase in Private Equity portfolio earnings, which underpinned the GBP 684 million value growth.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We generated a good flow of realizations, delivering proceeds of GBP 841 million, and a money multiple of 2x.",1446
18511,"2015m5","When you exclude refinancings, the uplift over book value was 27%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have a significantly more robust and efficient platform, and our cash operating profit increased from GBP 5 million to GBP 28 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Fund Management business has delivered an underlying operating profit of GBP 33 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as Simon said, our balance sheet is sound, and we have funded GBP 474 million of total cash investments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The strength of realizations and the significant reduction in cash leakage from cost and interests, have allowed us to close the year with no gearing.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The model is working well.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that's why we have announced a total dividend for the year of 20p per share.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We closed the year with NAV per share of 396p, up 14% on last year, and a total return of 20%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's great results.",1446
18511,"2015m5","You can see on this slide the positive contribution that we've had from both value growth and realized profits.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The impact of the reduction in our cost base and interest build means that the dilution of those returns is significantly lower.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The net carry payable is a direct cost of the strong portfolio performance that we've delivered.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Currency was volatile throughout the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In the end, the net translation effect of a strong U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","dollar and a weaker euro took 12p off NAV.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I've given you the updated sensitivities and the breakdown of net assets by currency in the back of the pack, so you can continue to track these effects.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Finally, we paid 6p of our proposed 20p total dividend in January.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Together with last year's final dividend, that results in the 19p that you can see here.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As you've seen, all 3 of our businesses contributed to the strong performance in the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I'll focus on the individual businesses first before covering the group KPIs in more detail.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Private Equity has had a very good year, generating a gross investment return of GBP 719 million, and that's after FX, or 24% of opening portfolio value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've reduced the portfolio to 65 investments at the year end, right in line with our longer-term aim to reduce to less than 40 assets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And while the overall number of companies in the portfolio -- reducing the overall number of companies in the portfolio, we've generated realized profits of GBP 144 million, and an uplift of 27% over opening value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we've reshaped the portfolio towards what we call our keeper assets.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Of the GBP 830 million cash proceeds that we received from Private Equity, GBP 155 million was the result of our decision to take advantage of favorable debt markets to refinance some of our strongest and cash-generative investments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Here, I'm talking about Action, Element and Amor.",1446
18511,"2015m5","When there is a refinancing, cash is usually returned to us by repayment of shareholder loans, which means there's little or no uplift on those proceeds.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In total, we fully sold 19 assets, generating GBP 456 million of proceeds as well as realizing good returns from investments such as Hilite, a 31% IRR and a 2.",1446
18511,"2015m5","1x money multiple; and Vedici, a 48% uplift and another 2x money multiple.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We also sold a 12 investments, which had an individual book values of less than GBP 5 million each, at the 31st of March 2014.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Bouyant Equity Markets meant we were able to IPO 4 companies: Phibro in the U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","in April, D.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Phone in China in July; they were followed by Eltel in Stockholm; and Refresco in Amsterdam towards the end of the year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We completely sold down our investments in Phibro during the year, and we realized GBP 273 million in proceeds from IPOs and quota sales.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as at the 31st of March 2015, our quota portfolio had a closing value of GBP 273 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Realizations and our cash to cash returns are the ultimate measure of our success.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But in the meantime, the value growth in our portfolio gives you evidence of the progress that we are making.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Value-weighted earnings growth was 19% for the 33 companies that we value on an earnings basis.",1446
18511,"2015m5","By comparison, that measure was 9% 3 years ago.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And although the 19% and the 9% are not directly comparable, what they do show is the improvement in the portfolio mix, the buckets that we talked about.",1446
18511,"2015m5","At the 31st of March 2012, 22% of the portfolio value was in 31 companies with negative earnings growth.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Now 3 years later, only 7% by value of the portfolio, or 7 companies, have negative growth.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the strong performance of our keepers and our more recent investments are not being diluted.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Action makes a significant contribution to this measure of earnings growth because it's our largest investment and it's growing at 30%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","If you take out Action, the growth is 16%, which is still very respectable.",1446
18511,"2015m5","All our most recent investments are included in the calculation, and about 2% of the total growth comes from the 20-or-so acquisitions made by our portfolio companies, and substantially funded from their own resources.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's the effect of the portfolio dynamism that Simon talked about.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The growth flows through to the unrealized value growth in what we call performance of GBP 417 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That strong performance also reflects the fact that we have only used lower forecast earnings for 2 portfolio companies, with a total value of GBP 63 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's down from 4 companies valued at GBP 99 million last year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Now in the past, I've talked about the approach we take to setting multiples and the effect that approach has on our valuations, especially when Equity Markets are so high.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We monitor comparable quota companies, but we are also guided by our exit expectations and the longer-term cycle or sector trends.",1446
18511,"2015m5","With the FTSE 100 around 7,000 and the average multiple of our relevant global market indices increasing by over 16% in the year, and 12% in the last quarter alone, we adjusted the multiples we used in 70% of cases.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We still recorded a GBP 64 million increase in value from multiple expansion, and that was mostly due to our decision to increase the multiple we used to value Action, from 12.",1446
18511,"2015m5","5x post-discount to 13.",1446
18511,"2015m5","If we exclude Action, the value-weighted average post-discount multiple is 9.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Simon mentioned our investments in Scandlines.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As well as good performance, the valuation has also increased because we have extended our assumption about the opening date of the competing tunnel.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Scandlines is the main contributor to the increase in the DCF category.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The imminent sale category includes Azelis, Touchtunes, Inspecta and Soya.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The sale of Azelis is an excellent outcome.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Its value at the 31st of March was GBP 26 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We completed the transaction last week, and expect to receive proceeds of GBP 66 million shortly.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that GBP 66 million is fully reflected in the value at the 31st of March 2015.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The performance of our quota portfolio reflects the investment's good performance and positive equity market sentiment.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Finally, on the portfolio, here are the top 20 Private Equity investments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","They account for 79% of the portfolio, and are generally trending with a positive outlook.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The strong performance of the portfolio and our realizations mean an increase in the amount that we accrue for carried interest payable to the investment team.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The majority of our Private Equity investments are now held in carry schemes that have met their performance hurdle, assuming we sold everything today at book value.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we now expect to accrue carry payable at between 10% to 15% of the gross investment return.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And it's only paid out when the hurdle is met with cash returns.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As you can see, we paid GBP 7 million in cash in the period.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The multiples for Eurofund V and the growth capital fund have now increased to 1.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The 2010 to 2012 assets in Eurofund V, which include Action, continued to perform well.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But at the fund level, we also include the 2007 to 2009 investments.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we remain below the performance hurdle, and that means we are not recognizing carry receivable for this fund.",1446
18511,"2015m5","During the year, the growth capital fund has passed its performance hurdle on a valuation basis.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And we've now recognized GBP 25 million of carry receivable from this fund.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So this has been another strong year for Private Equity, the biggest contributor and now a solid foundation for our NAV progression.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Infrastructure business contributes to our returns through our 34% investment in 3i Infrastructure plc, and through the profitability of its Funds Management and advisory activity.",1446
18511,"2015m5","There has been a step change in Infrastructure's contribution through gross investment return.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's because the share price of 3iN increased by 19% to 160p, which together with dividend income, contributed to a total shareholder return of 25%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","3iN announced its results on Tuesday, and they reported a 24.",1446
18511,"2015m5","6% return as a result of the sale of Eversholt Rail and significant valuation uplifts on its core European portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As well as the advisory fee, we earn an NAV-based performance fee.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And as a result of 3iN's strong performance in the year, we expect to receive a fee of GBP 45 million.",1446
18511,"2015m5","75% of that has been set aside for the investment team, in line with the arrangements that were put in place at the time of 3iN's listing.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've introduced a significant element of deferral in these performance rewards, and we will award a substantial proportion over at least 3 to 5 years.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that will be in line with the principles of the compensation review that we completed in 2013.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our Debt Management business is principally a Funds Management platform.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Our teams at both the U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","and Europe, had a very good year of fundraising.",1446
18511,"2015m5","During the year, Debt Management closed 6 new CLOs in Europe and the U.",1446
18511,"2015m5",", and the team launched a new mid-market loan fund in Europe.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Those CLOs and new fund added GBP 2.",1446
18511,"2015m5","4 billion to our AUM, which more than offset the runoff in the older European funds.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we've finished the year with assets under management of GBP 7.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We invested GBP 105 million of our Proprietary Capital in Debt Management, split between GBP 26 million in warehouses that will seed future CLO launches, and GBP 79 million in the CLOs that we've actually launched.",1446
18511,"2015m5","After divestments, we had 160 -- GBP 176 million of value invested in Debt Management products.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Ignoring capital flows, there was a net value reduction of GBP 25 million this year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Almost 2/3 of that GBP 25 million was the result of distributions paid.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But there were also some short-term mark-to-market volatility in the valuation of recent CLO issues.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Fee income increased to GBP 34 million, and if we include portfolio income, the business generated GBP 56 million of cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So all 3 businesses contributed to the strong performance, and that is borne out by our strong set of KPIs.",1446
18511,"2015m5","At the group level, we have achieved an annual cash operating profit of GBP 28 million, and that's a very real increase from our first time profit of GBP 5 million in 2014.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've also made progress in generating operating income from both our fund and asset management activities, while staying highly disciplined on costs.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Operating expenses, excluding restructuring costs, have increased by 2%, mainly due to increased variable compensation, as business performance has improved and AUM increased by 4%.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As we finished the period of restructuring and transition, we have started some recruitment to support investment activity in all 3 business lines.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But we remain totally focused on cost discipline, and we expect costs to stay at around 1% of AUM.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We have a strong balance sheet and our financial performance during the year has strengthened this even further.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We finished the year with net cash of GBP 49 million and gross debt of GBP 815 million, made up of our bonds due in 2017, 2023 and 2032.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We refinanced the RCF in September, extending its maturity to 2019, with the potential to extend out to 2020 and 2021.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Liquidity is also strong.",1446
18511,"2015m5","GBP 864 million of the GBP 1.",1446
18511,"2015m5","2 billion is now cash.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In 2012, we talked about a target capital allocation model that would increase the funds available for future investments and enhance distribution to shareholders.",1446
18511,"2015m5","As Simon said, today, we have proposed a 20p dividend for the year, which equates to a final dividend of 14p.",1446
18511,"2015m5","That's ahead of our expected range of 15% to 20% of gross cash realization proceeds, but it reflects the board's confidence in both the performance of the business and the strength of the balance sheet.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Of the 14p proposed, 5.",1446
18511,"2015m5","4p is the final base dividend and 8.",1446
18511,"2015m5","6p is the additional dividend.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So our performance in FY 2015 was strong.",1446
18511,"2015m5","All 3 businesses are performing well, and our results provide further evidence of the progress that we have made since 2012.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Thank you very much, and Simon and I will now be happy to take questions.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Let me have a go.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, in terms of the earnings growth, I think this really splits down.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So ultimately, it's the management of these businesses that really determine the strength of the earnings growth, whether it be an Azelis or whether it be an Action.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But the 3i teams are very knowledgeable and engaged shareholders, so they can be very good at prompting change and also making judgments that use our other experiences in the past or across the portfolio to help management tackle market challenges.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And in particular, our own style is to help businesses internationalize.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And again, we have a lot of experience in internationalizing these mid-sized companies and bringing contacts and other benefits to those management.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the fundamental driver, particularly of the better company is down, I would say in the main, to them being good companies in interesting sectors with strong management teams and a very engaged shareholder.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We've been more hands-on and more active in the problem companies, where we've seen a very significant turnaround from negative earnings momentum to, in some cases, really quite positive earnings momentum.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that's involved a great deal of time from the 3i executives involved in them.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I mean, is it sustainable? I suppose what we have seen a broadly is a pickup in confidence in the overall environment over the last 6 months, in particular, really since the European Central Bank started signaling that QE was going to be the order of the day.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So that was quite noticeable across much of the portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I think the better companies will continue to prosper.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Fortunately, for us, the better companies now dominate the value of the portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So we're anticipating another healthy year coming out of this portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","We don't see any dramatic change or anything like that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","The last point was the investment point? Okay.",1446
18511,"2015m5","There are some mics at the back.",1446
18511,"2015m5","They'll bring them up to you.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Philip? Bill? When we gave that guidance, we were coming from a position where the group had been seeing about GBP 100 million of operating cost leakage a year.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So the other big factor that's clearly changed is we're making an operating cash surplus out of the current business.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's worth reflecting on Action, what it is and how it's different because you've seen a couple of stocks come to the market here, B&M and Poundland.",1446
18511,"2015m5","Action, unlike those 2, is a multi-country retailer, and it's got what I call, the Holy Grail of retail in that the box that opens in Holland is the same as the box that opens in Belgium, in Germany and in France, and wherever it decides to go to next.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So that is a great advantage the company has.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's not dependent on food.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's got 10 categories, they're all about the same.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So it's a general discounter.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And it has a lot of momentum in the business in Europe, because finding good retail sites or sites that Action trade out of fairly easily, is much easier than it would be if it was trying to find the same sort of sites in the U.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So there are a lot of fundamental drivers about Action that give us a great deal of confidence.",1446
18511,"2015m5","On the realizations, I'd love to think it would -- well, particularly, the bottom 2 buckets go to 0, but I think that's unlikely.",1446
18511,"2015m5","I think we're always going to have a ragbag around at the bottom.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But it'll be de minimis in terms of value, ultimately.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So it won't be, in any way, a real driver or drag on the growth coming out of our portfolio.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So I would expect to see this trend continue quite strongly over the next couple of years, even if it doesn't quite get to 0.",1446
18511,"2015m5","In terms of dividend policy, maybe I'll make a comment and then Julia can pick this up, I would say we gave a guidance back in 2012, '13 to reassure shareholders that we were going to be providing meaningful cash dividends going forward, the 15% to 20% of realizations.",1446
18511,"2015m5","And that's what we've used.",1446
18511,"2015m5","It's been a guidance for that.",1446
18511,"2015m5","But if you look at 3i today, I think it is a strong cash machine going forward.",1446
18511,"2015m5","So whether we're a slave to that original dividend guidance or whether we tipped slightly over it, as we did today, I think these are nice problems to have that we'll address as we come to them.",1446
18511,"2016m11","I think there are a number of levers to pull and we're obviously more confident about being able to meet that challenge without the Debt Management business, and that was part of the consideration of the timing of that sale.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's not going to come from a new Private Equity fund, but we do on fees when we invest, co-invest as money and in a number of investments we look at, we will look to bring in co-investors with us, as we have been this year.",889
18511,"2016m11","And also in Infrastructure, we have a growing number of initiatives and 3iN, itself, is growing very strongly.",889
18511,"2016m11","So we do see a good ramp up in income across the group, across both sides of that and a significant reduction in cost as a result of selling Debt Management and as a result of taking out one of the long-term debt issues.",889
18511,"2016m11","Any more? Can't tempt you?
Okay.",889
18511,"2016m11","Thanks for coming.",889
18511,"2016m11","We appreciate the time.",889
18511,"2016m11","All right, bye-bye.",889
18511,"2016m11","Philip, just behind you? Go on.",889
18511,"2016m11","Daniel Garrod, Barclays.",889
18511,"2016m11","A couple of questions for me.",889
18511,"2016m11","First for Julia, question on the earnings momentum, appreciate you said you didn't want to provide an average snap, but it only looks like from the buckets detail that you've given, a fair chunk has moved into that greater than 30% earnings growth.",889
18511,"2016m11","I think you spoke in May when you last presented of an expectation that average of that 8% [ph] that you detailed extraction at that point would have been a trough.",889
18511,"2016m11","Do you think you have seen improvement on average? That bucket disclosure would seem to suggest that, but you can sort of confirm that first.",889
18511,"2016m11","Second question to Simon, you've spoken in the past about your excitement around specifically the Euro-Diesel and Aspen pumps assets.",889
18511,"2016m11","There, we see currently less evaluation on your rankings the value, but they look very fast growing.",889
18511,"2016m11","You don't detail them in the examples on your sort of 4, 5 bucket categories, but am I right in presuming they would be bucket 1 category, that these are long-term holds for you? Any comment on that? Yes, yes.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've got Daniel here.",889
18511,"2016m11","Thank you, Simon.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've had a busy first half of the year and produced an excellent set of results.",889
18511,"2016m11","As you know, we've also sold -- announced the sale of our Debt Management business.",889
18511,"2016m11","In a minute, I'll talk about that transaction and its implications for our numbers.",889
18511,"2016m11","We closed the period with NAV of 551p per share, 19% up from the start of the year, and that's after accounting both the FY '16's final dividend of 16p.",889
18511,"2016m11","The biggest contribution to that growth was a strong performance from our Private Equity portfolio.",889
18511,"2016m11","Infrastructure progressed well and it was actually the best 6 months ever for our Debt Management business.",889
18511,"2016m11","Sterling's weakness since the outcome of the Brexit the referendum has been a positive for us because 70% of our assets are euro and dollar denominated.",889
18511,"2016m11","While it's good to see FX go the right way for us after several years of losses, the gain is only on translation.",889
18511,"2016m11","To mitigate actual FX exposure, we're holding euros for euro investment and dollars for dollar investment.",889
18511,"2016m11","That way, we can match our large cash flows as much as possible.",889
18511,"2016m11","If you net out carry, costs and last year's final dividend, we get to the 551p per share.",889
18511,"2016m11","So let's look at our Private Equity business, where we have GBP 4.",889
18511,"2016m11","4 billion of our Proprietary Capital invested.",889
18511,"2016m11","We generated an excellent gross investment return of GBP 989 million, giving a return of 26%.",889
18511,"2016m11","Simon just talked about the realizations in the period, which generated cash proceeds of GBP 654 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","That was over 2 times the money invested.",889
18511,"2016m11","The uplift over opening value was 9%, which reflects the timing of the sales of Mayborn and Amor, and GBP 143 million of the proceeds was from the sales of quoted investments, such as .",889
18511,"2016m11","The big driver of Private Equity's gross investment return was the strength of our portfolio performance and earnings growth.",889
18511,"2016m11","This slide shows you the earnings growth of the 20 large investments, which account for 89% of the total Private Equity portfolio value.",889
18511,"2016m11","You'll see that we dropped the value weighted average earnings measure.",889
18511,"2016m11","We now have only 44 unquoted investments and 3 quoted stakes.",889
18511,"2016m11","So talking about averages, it's less meaningful than talking about individual investments, but the shape of the chart here does show you how well our investments are doing.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's a very good picture with 15 out of the 20 companies showing positive earnings growth and 60% of the total Private Equity portfolio value growing at better than 10%.",889
18511,"2016m11","In particular, 3/4 of the investments we made in the last 4 years are in the right-hand 3 bars.",889
18511,"2016m11","Of course, Action is GBP 1.",889
18511,"2016m11","5 billion of the greater than 30% bar.",889
18511,"2016m11","But even without it, the profile is sound.",889
18511,"2016m11","The investments with negative earnings are the businesses as we have been talking about for a while, which continue to be impacted by macro challenges.",889
18511,"2016m11","But I'm pleased to say that a number of companies have moved to the greater than 30% bucket in the last 6 months.",889
18511,"2016m11","This strong portfolio performance comes through the value growth of GBP 643 million, which you can see here in detail.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have materially increased the value of our investments in Action, from GBP 902 million at the 31st of March 2016, to GBP 1.",889
18511,"2016m11","5 billion at the 30th of September.",889
18511,"2016m11","As a lot of you saw at the Capital Markets Day in June, Action continues to perform ahead of expectations.",889
18511,"2016m11","That strong execution's being noticed, and we've got a number of third-party approaches.",889
18511,"2016m11","Needless to say, we've declined to discuss any of these propositions.",889
18511,"2016m11","About half of Action's GBP 547 million value gain is because we increased its multiple from 14x at March to 18.",889
18511,"2016m11","2x in June.",889
18511,"2016m11","And given its earnings performance and cash generation, it's already down to 16.",889
18511,"2016m11","8x post discount at September.",889
18511,"2016m11","If you take Action out of the equation, the average multiple came down from 10.",889
18511,"2016m11","7x, and this is principally due to Basic-Fit now being quoted.",889
18511,"2016m11","More generally, we continue to adjust multiples down, where we think that the comparable multiples are ahead of longer-term and sector averages.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our aim is to mitigate some of the market volatility that we might otherwise see.",889
18511,"2016m11","Scandlines is the most significant Private Equity investment that we value on a DCF basis.",889
18511,"2016m11","Its good performance and cash generation is reflected in lower debt, and therefore, in it's weighted average cost of capital, which is used in the discount rate.",889
18511,"2016m11","And that's the main cause of its value increase in this period.",889
18511,"2016m11","Basic-Fit came to market in June this year, and its shares have performed very well since IPO.",889
18511,"2016m11","It accounts for the majority of our quoted uplift of GBP 56 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Agent Provocateur write-down of GBP 39 million is reflected in the Other category, and that's because we've taken it off on earnings basis for now.",889
18511,"2016m11","You'll notice that we do not have any investments in the imminent sale category.",889
18511,"2016m11","Although we've announced the signing of an implementation agreement for the sale of ACR, there are a number of regulatory steps to complete, so we've taken a cautious view of valuation at this time.",889
18511,"2016m11","The strong performance of the Private Equity portfolio is reflected in the amount of carry payable and carry receivable that we recognize.",889
18511,"2016m11","By way of reminder, 3i receives carry on third-party money that we manage, subject to performance conditions.",889
18511,"2016m11","We're already recognizing carry on the growth capital fund.",889
18511,"2016m11","At the year end, we said that Eurofund V had also gone through its hurdle on an accounting basis, so we're now accruing carry receivable on investments in that fund.",889
18511,"2016m11","The growth in Action and realizations such as Amor and Geka are factors in the GBP 203 million we recognized in the first half.",889
18511,"2016m11","We pay carry to our investment teams, past and present, again, subject to performance conditions.",889
18511,"2016m11","And we've been through the performance hurdles on most of our schemes on an accounting basis for quite some time.",889
18511,"2016m11","That's all about accounting recognition.",889
18511,"2016m11","We passed an important milestone in the first half.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Amor disposal means that the 2010-'12 carry payable scheme is now through its hurdle on a cash basis.",889
18511,"2016m11","That means we're now actually paying out carry on this plan, not just accruing for it.",889
18511,"2016m11","That is the main reason why the net cash paid in the period has increased to GBP 54 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","Private Equity's principal contribution to NAV and group performance is the capital returns from its investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","As you can see here, we've also maintained a good level of portfolio dividend and interest income.",889
18511,"2016m11","As I've said before, this income is asset specific and can vary depending on investment in realization flows, but we will continue to focus on cash portfolio income where it makes sense to do so.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our Infrastructure team have had a particularly busy 6 months.",889
18511,"2016m11","They raised equity for 3i Infrastructure plc and have lots of investment activity, including new investments such as TCL and week.",889
18511,"2016m11","3iN shares performed very strongly, increasing by more than 15% compared to its equity issue price.",889
18511,"2016m11","The increase in 3iN share price accounts for GBP 80 million of the GBP 90 million in our gross investment return.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Infrastructure business also makes an important contribution to cash income through fees and dividends, and we expect the returns from Infrastructure to be a more meaningful component of our operating cash profit in the future.",889
18511,"2016m11","That's particularly after the sale of Debt Management completes.",889
18511,"2016m11","Before talking about that transaction, I'd like to show you the contribution that the Debt Management business has made in this 6-month period.",889
18511,"2016m11","The team have also been busy with the launch of 2 new CLOs in Europe and 1 in the U.",889
18511,"2016m11","In fact, they added GBP 1 billion to their AUM.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's a particularly strong 6 months for the valuation of our CLO equity investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","One reason for that is the generally improved investor sentiment, meaning we recognize value growth of GBP 13 million, and that's despite also receiving GBP 24 million of distributions in the same period, which is included in the total cash income of GBP 50 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","After allowing for the businesses direct cost of GBP 12 million, the net contribution to our total return was GBP 84 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","We announced the sale of our Debt Management business on the 25th of October, and that transaction will result in a significant simplification of the group.",889
18511,"2016m11","The transaction is subject to a number of closing conditions, including a regulatory approval in the U.",889
18511,"2016m11","and Bahrain, but we expect it to complete by the 31st of March 2017.",889
18511,"2016m11","As a result, we're showing the business line as a discontinued operation.",889
18511,"2016m11","You see some of this disclosure in today's full announcement.",889
18511,"2016m11","We said in our announcement that Debt Management has played an important role in the operational efficiency of the group since the strategic review in 2012.",889
18511,"2016m11","Here's a reminder of how far we've come since then.",889
18511,"2016m11","Maintaining and operating cash profit without the Debt Management business will be more of a challenge.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have had the benefit of their contribution in the first half of this financial year, and we will be helped by the good progress of initiatives and investment in the Infrastructure business as well as continuing focus on generating income in the Private Equity business.",889
18511,"2016m11","And of course, we're still acutely focused on maintaining a lean cost base across the group to mitigate against the leakages of the past.",889
18511,"2016m11","Operating expenses will step down as a result of the Debt Management disposal.",889
18511,"2016m11","The annual direct costs of that business are about GBP 20 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","Improved cost efficiency has been a key part of the reallocation of capital across the group, and you can also see that reallocation in the strength of our balance sheet.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've talked about the increase in portfolio value, which was GBP 5.",889
18511,"2016m11","1 million -- GBP 5.",889
18511,"2016m11","1 billion, excluding the Debt Management business.",889
18511,"2016m11","Total cash at the 30th of September was GBP 1,031,000,000.",889
18511,"2016m11","If you combine that with the GBP 329 million of undrawn RCF, it means we have liquidity of almost GBP 1.",889
18511,"2016m11","When we repay our Eurobond in March, the gross debt of GBP 844 million will step down by about GBP 270 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","Like our approach for matching investment flows, we are holding euro cash to fund that repayment.",889
18511,"2016m11","Net cash at the 30th of September was GBP 187 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","In line with our policy, which we updated in May, we have declared an 8p interim dividend.",889
18511,"2016m11","And of course, that's half of the 16p base dividend.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our policy change gives us more flexibility when we're setting the additional dividend that we'll pay at the final.",889
18511,"2016m11","With such a strong first half performance and a good half realizations, we have confirmed today that we expect to pay a total dividend for the year of not less than last year's 22p.",889
18511,"2016m11","So this has been a very good first half performance, and it's been underpinned by excellent performance overall from the Private Equity portfolio and good execution from the Infrastructure business.",889
18511,"2016m11","As Simon said in his statement today, the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape continues to be challenging.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our investments obviously can't be immune to the markets that they operate in, but we are navigating these challenges from a position of real strength.",889
18511,"2016m11","Thank you, and we'll now take questions.",889
18511,"2016m11","Good morning, and welcome to 3i's Interim Results.",889
18511,"2016m11","We live in interesting times, but I'm pleased to say that 3i continues to deliver solid results.",889
18511,"2016m11","All 3 of our business lines have performed well in the first half, and we generated a robust performance in our portfolio of investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","Realization flows have remained strong, and we've made interesting new investments in both Private Equity and Infrastructure.",889
18511,"2016m11","The group's financial model continues to work well, and we're enjoying good momentum.",889
18511,"2016m11","You can see what I mean by momentum in these KPIs, which are actually for a six-month period, not a full year.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our investment portfolio is driving very strong NAV performance and delivering on an excellent return on equity.",889
18511,"2016m11","The strong operating cash performance we've generated is underpinned by a robust balance sheet.",889
18511,"2016m11","Julia will give you more details on that in a minute.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our goal remains to deliver attractive proprietary investment profits and growing cash distributions from a cost efficient platform.",889
18511,"2016m11","On the 25th of October, we announced the sale of our Debt Management division to .",889
18511,"2016m11","The division has performed well since we bought it in 2011, and AUM has doubled to about $12 billion under 3i's ownership.",889
18511,"2016m11","But Debt Management is a very different business to our 2 other investment divisions, and its annual cash flows are less important to the 3i of today than they were.",889
18511,"2016m11","Once again, our Private Equity business has delivered a very strong performance.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Private Equity team gave us an excellent portfolio performance, with a GIR of GBP 1 billion.",889
18511,"2016m11","And we completed a good number of realizations as well as making some interesting new investments at sensible prices.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our portfolio now has 44 companies and 3 listed holdings.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's been good to see strong performance across the portfolio.",889
18511,"2016m11","And apart from Action, the strongest performance came from the assets we purchased since our strategic review in 2012.",889
18511,"2016m11","In all cases, we bought these assets with tight price disciplines, and they've already valued a 1.",889
18511,"2016m11","This compares very well with other funds of that same vintage.",889
18511,"2016m11","You're probably tired of hearing me say it, but Action continues to power on at the same sort of growth rates they've produced for the last 5 years.",889
18511,"2016m11","The store opening program has stepped up another gear.",889
18511,"2016m11","And in the last few months, the Action team has celebrated opening its 700th store, it's 750th, and will shortly celebrate its 800th opening.",889
18511,"2016m11","The new stores in all countries are performing consistently well, and they produce returns on capital of over 100% in their first year.",889
18511,"2016m11","Today, if you were to capitalize each new stores' profits at any sensible multiple, you can value each store at over EUR 5 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","And it looks like we'll open close to 200 this year.",889
18511,"2016m11","That's an outstanding value creation by any measure.",889
18511,"2016m11","And cash flow and like-for-likes remain as strong as you've seen in previous year.",889
18511,"2016m11","The oil and gas sector remains weak all over the world, and that affects the performance of our oil and gas related assets, namely JMJ and Dynatect.",889
18511,"2016m11","And it's also been a tricky year in retail.",889
18511,"2016m11","Footfall is down and it's a difficult luxury market.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've taken a write down in our invest in Agent Provocateur, which is a Eurofund V legacy asset from 2007.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've signaled for some time the impact of a declining luxury spend, but that macro factor has been compounded by an inconsistent store expansion program and some accounting issues we only discovered in August but appear to go back a number of years.",889
18511,"2016m11","Agent Provocateur is the largest write-down in the first half, even though it's less than 1% of our portfolio.",889
18511,"2016m11","Moving on, we've had another busy half of realizations.",889
18511,"2016m11","We delivered some GBP 650 million of proceeds at an average multiple of 2.",889
18511,"2016m11","And about 1/3 of that money has come from the more recent investment vintages.",889
18511,"2016m11","Recently, there's been volatility in both sentiment and markets, and that's not making realization activity easy or predictable.",889
18511,"2016m11","But with our very strong start, we feel confident in generating a good level of proceeds for the full year.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've seen a good pickup in our investment pipeline, but we've continued to be careful in our assessment of these targets.",889
18511,"2016m11","In August, we made another new investment in Germany in a company called Schlemmer.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have good experience and expertise in the automotive sector and Schlemmer is a strong international company with well-developed OEM relationships.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's prime to grow on the back of the accelerating need for more wires and electronics in cars.",889
18511,"2016m11","We also purchased BoConcept in a public to private transaction in Denmark.",889
18511,"2016m11","The bulk of the shares were bought from the founding family.",889
18511,"2016m11","BoConcept is a classic Scandinavian style for urban living.",889
18511,"2016m11","The company has a very strong brand for its size and has significant further international potential that's underpinned by strong demographic trends.",889
18511,"2016m11","I suspect a few of you here may enjoy stretching out on your BoConcept sofa at weekends.",889
18511,"2016m11","And for those of you who have yet to experience those, I'm glad to say there's a BoConcept store in Tottenham Court Road.",889
18511,"2016m11","And as some of you have seen, we just announced the acquisition of Ponroy Santé on Friday last week.",889
18511,"2016m11","Again, this was a purchase from the founding family in a primary buyout.",889
18511,"2016m11","This is a very well-regarded company based in France.",889
18511,"2016m11","Ponroy has strong brands, and it sits right in the megatrend of natural healthcare and well-being.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have ambitious plans to accelerate the growth of this plans -- these brands internationally.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's worth mentioning that the list of potential new investments is strong for both Private Equity and Infrastructure.",889
18511,"2016m11","As a result, we remain very selective.",889
18511,"2016m11","That means we're putting a very sharp focus on any potential investment thesis and on the price returns balance.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our 4 principle bucket have continued to develop well, with buckets 1 and 2 remaining dominant.",889
18511,"2016m11","The majority of companies in the top 2 buckets are now made up of 2012 plus investments, and that's even after transferring Basic-Fit to bucket 5.",889
18511,"2016m11","Infrastructure is a core division of the group.",889
18511,"2016m11","Let me say that again.",889
18511,"2016m11","Infrastructure is a core division of the group and has had a very good start to the year, and we have real momentum in that division.",889
18511,"2016m11","They've been very active investing and the team has put together an interesting set of midsized infrastructure investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","They've produced excellent returns for 3i group through both portfolio performance and operating cash income.",889
18511,"2016m11","Unlike other 3iN shareholders, we've done very well from the equity placing in June at 165p.",889
18511,"2016m11","One of the reasons behind our recent sale of Debt Management was because of the sound financial position of the group.",889
18511,"2016m11","A lean cost base, strong cash flow and top-tier performance from our 2 main investment divisions give us confidence in delivering strong financial returns as well as good levels of shareholder distributions.",889
18511,"2016m11","And as Julia will explain shortly, given the exceptional performance of the group, we now expect to recommend a total dividend for the year of not less than 22p.",889
18511,"2016m11","So another decent half for 3i against some pretty tricky markets and macroeconomic environment.",889
18511,"2016m11","The overall strength of our portfolio proprietary investments continues to improve, and the group is now in really good shape financially.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have good focus and has a high energy level across all of our teams.",889
18511,"2016m11","We're now better placed to cope with tougher macroeconomic conditions and the old bump in the road, and the current momentum in the group should offer the prospect of excellent shareholder returns going forward.",889
18511,"2016m11","So thank you, and I'll now pass over to Julia.",889
18511,"2016m11","So let me pick up earnings growth please first.",889
18511,"2016m11","So yes, just to reassure you, there's nothing sinister in deciding not to disclose a weighted average measure.",889
18511,"2016m11","As we talked about in the year end, it just becomes more idiosyncratic looking at different movements of the relative populations.",889
18511,"2016m11","But you're right, as I've indicated, we've got a number more companies, 6 companies in that greater than 30% growth bucket.",889
18511,"2016m11","We particularly saw actually the 2 companies you just referred to Euro-Diesel, Aspen pumps and a number of the more recent investments in the second quarter in particular starting to come through much more strongly in terms of earnings growth, so you're about right in your assumptions.",889
18511,"2016m11","Can you at least a couple of words.",889
18511,"2016m11","If we look at the targeted cash court income, obviously selling the Debt business makes that harder.",889
18511,"2016m11","On the other hand, in refi or just getting rid of the Eurobond makes that easier.",889
18511,"2016m11","How important you to be break even? If it's really important to you, what levers have you got to pull for that? Or are you just saying the sales, we're much more robust now if it's there or thereabouts, that's fine.",889
18511,"2016m11","No is the response there.",889
18511,"2016m11","Iain Scouller from Stifel.",889
18511,"2016m11","Given the continuing strong performance from the investment portfolio, do you have any plans to launch or issue a new LP Private Equity fund? Hold on.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've got Daniel here.",889
18511,"2016m11","So yes, just to reassure you, there's nothing sinister in deciding not to disclose a weighted average value measure.",889
18511,"2016m11","As we talked about at the year-end, it just becomes more idiosyncratic looking at different movements of the relative populations.",889
18511,"2016m11","But you're right, as I had indicated, we've gotten a number more companies, 6 companies, in that greater-than-30% growth bucket.",889
18511,"2016m11","We particularly saw actually the 2 companies you just referred to, Euro-Diesel and Aspen Pumps, and a number of the more recent investments in the second quarter in particular starting to come through much more strongly in terms of earnings growth.",889
18511,"2016m11","So you're about right in your assumptions.",889
18511,"2016m11","Yes, please.",889
18511,"2016m11","Iain Scouller from Stifel.",889
18511,"2016m11","Given the continuing strong performance from the investment portfolio, do you have any plans to launch or issue a new LP Private Equity Fund? Thank you, Simon.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've had a busy first half of the year and produced an excellent set of results.",889
18511,"2016m11","As you know, we've also sold or announced the sale of our Debt Management business.",889
18511,"2016m11","In a minute, I'll talk about that transaction and its implications for our numbers.",889
18511,"2016m11","We closed the period with NAV of 551p per share, 19% up from the start of the year.",889
18511,"2016m11","And that's after counting for FY '16's final dividend of 16p.",889
18511,"2016m11","The biggest contribution to that growth was the strong performance from our Private Equity portfolio.",889
18511,"2016m11","Infrastructure progressed well, and it was actually the best 6 months ever for our Debt Management business.",889
18511,"2016m11","Sterling's weakness since the outcome of the Brexit referendum has been a positive for us because 70% of our assets are euro and dollar denominated.",889
18511,"2016m11","While it's good to see FX go the right way for us after several years of losses, the gain is only on translation.",889
18511,"2016m11","To mitigate actual FX exposure, we're holding euros for euro investment and dollars for dollar investment.",889
18511,"2016m11","That way, we can match our large cash flows as much as possible.",889
18511,"2016m11","If you net out carry, costs and last year's final dividend, we get to the 551p per share.",889
18511,"2016m11","So let's look at our Private Equity business, where we have GBP 4.",889
18511,"2016m11","4 billion of our Proprietary Capital invested.",889
18511,"2016m11","We generated an excellent gross investment return of GBP 989 million, giving a return of 26%.",889
18511,"2016m11","Simon just talked about the realizations in the period, which generated cash proceeds of GBP 654 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","That was over 2x the money invested.",889
18511,"2016m11","The uplift over opening value was 9%, which reflects the timing of the sales of Mayborn and Amor, and GBP 143 million of the proceeds were from the sales of quoted investments such as Quintiles.",889
18511,"2016m11","A big driver of Private Equity's gross investment return was the strength of our portfolio performance and earnings growth.",889
18511,"2016m11","This slide shows you the earnings growth of the 20 large investments, which account for 89% of the total Private Equity portfolio value.",889
18511,"2016m11","You'll see that we've dropped the value-weighted average earnings measure.",889
18511,"2016m11","We now have only 44 unquoted investments and 3 quoted stakes.",889
18511,"2016m11","So talking about averages is less meaningful than talking about individual investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","But the shape of the chart here does show you how well our investments are doing.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's a very good picture with 15 out of the 20 companies showing positive earnings growth and 60% of the total Private Equity portfolio value growing at better than 10%.",889
18511,"2016m11","In particular, 3/4 of the investments we made in the last 4 years are in the right-hand 3 bars.",889
18511,"2016m11","Of course, Action is GBP 1.",889
18511,"2016m11","5 billion of the greater-than-30% bar.",889
18511,"2016m11","But even without it, the profile is sound.",889
18511,"2016m11","Investments with negative earnings are the businesses we have been talking about for a while, which continue to be impacted by macro challenges.",889
18511,"2016m11","But I'm pleased to say that a number of companies have moved to the greater-than-30% bucket in the last 6 months.",889
18511,"2016m11","This strong portfolio performance comes through the value growth of GBP 643 million, which you can see here in detail.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have materially increased the value of our investments in Action from GBP 902 million at the 31st of March 2016, to GBP 1.",889
18511,"2016m11","5 billion at the 30th of September.",889
18511,"2016m11","As a lot of you saw at the Capital Markets Day in June, Action continues to perform ahead of expectations.",889
18511,"2016m11","That strong execution is being noticed, and we've got a number of third-party approaches.",889
18511,"2016m11","Needless to say, we decline to discuss any of these propositions.",889
18511,"2016m11","About half of Action's GBP 547 million value gain is because we increased its multiple from 14x at March to 18.",889
18511,"2016m11","2x in June.",889
18511,"2016m11","And given its earnings performance and cash generation, it's already down to 16.",889
18511,"2016m11","8x post discount at September.",889
18511,"2016m11","If you take Action out of the equation, the average multiple came down from 10.",889
18511,"2016m11","7x, and this is principally due to Basic-Fit now being quoted.",889
18511,"2016m11","More generally, we continue to adjust multiples down, where we think that the comparable multiples are ahead of longer-term and sector averages.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our aim is to mitigate some of the market volatility that we might otherwise see.",889
18511,"2016m11","Scandlines is the most significant Private Equity investment that we value on a DCF basis.",889
18511,"2016m11","Its good performance and cash generation is reflected in lower debt and, therefore, in it's weighted average cost of capital, which is used in the discount rate.",889
18511,"2016m11","And that's the main cause of its value increase in this period.",889
18511,"2016m11","Basic-Fit came to market in June this year, and its shares have performed very well since IPO.",889
18511,"2016m11","It accounts for a majority of our quoted uplift of GBP 56 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Agent Provocateur write-down of GBP 39 million is reflected in the other category, and that's because we've taken it off an earnings basis for now.",889
18511,"2016m11","You'll notice that we do not have any investments in the imminent sale category.",889
18511,"2016m11","Although we've announced the signing of an implementation agreement for the sale of ACR, there are a number of regulatory steps to complete.",889
18511,"2016m11","So we've taken a cautious view of valuation at this time.",889
18511,"2016m11","The strong performance of the Private Equity portfolio is reflected in the amount of carry payable and carry receivable that we recognize.",889
18511,"2016m11","By way of reminder, 3i receives carry on third-party money that we manage, subject to performance conditions.",889
18511,"2016m11","We're already recognizing carry on the growth capital fund.",889
18511,"2016m11","At the year-end, we said that Eurofund V had also gone through its hurdle on an accounting basis.",889
18511,"2016m11","So we're now accruing carry receivable on investments in that fund.",889
18511,"2016m11","The growth in Action and realizations, such as Amor and Geka, are factors in the GBP 203 million we recognized in the first half.",889
18511,"2016m11","We pay carry to our investment teams, past and present, again subject to performance conditions.",889
18511,"2016m11","And we've been through the performance hurdles on most of our schemes on an accounting basis for quite some time.",889
18511,"2016m11","That's all about accounting recognition.",889
18511,"2016m11","We passed an important milestone in the first half.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Amor disposal means that the 2010-'12 carry payable scheme is now through its hurdle on a cash basis.",889
18511,"2016m11","That means we're now actually paying out carry on this plan, not just accruing for it.",889
18511,"2016m11","That is the main reason why the net cash paid in the period has increased to GBP 54 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","Private Equity's principal contribution to NAV and group performance is the capital returns from its investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","As you can see here, we've also maintained a good level of portfolio dividend and interest income.",889
18511,"2016m11","As I've said before, this income is asset specific and can vary depending on investment and realization flows.",889
18511,"2016m11","But we will continue to focus on cash portfolio income where it makes sense to do so.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our Infrastructure team have had a particularly busy 6 months.",889
18511,"2016m11","They raised equity for 3i Infrastructure plc and had lots of investing activity, including new investments such as TCR and WIG.",889
18511,"2016m11","3iN shares performed very strongly, increasing by more than 15% compared to its equity issue price.",889
18511,"2016m11","The increase in 3iN share price accounts for GBP 80 million of the GBP 90 million in our gross investment return.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Infrastructure business also makes an important contribution to cash income through fees and dividends.",889
18511,"2016m11","And we expect the returns from Infrastructure to be a more meaningful component of our operating cash profit in the future.",889
18511,"2016m11","That's particularly after the sale of Debt Management completes.",889
18511,"2016m11","Before talking about that transaction, I'd like to show you the contribution that the Debt Management business has made in this 6-month period.",889
18511,"2016m11","The team have also been busy with the launch of 2 new CLOs in Europe and 1 in the U.",889
18511,"2016m11","In fact, they added GBP 1 billion to their AUM.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's a particularly strong 6 months for the valuation of our CLO equity investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","One reason for that is the generally improved investor sentiment, meaning we recognize value growth of GBP 13 million, and that's despite also receiving GBP 24 million of distributions in the same period, which is included in the total cash income of GBP 50 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","After allowing for the businesses' direct costs of GBP 12 million, the net contribution to our total return was GBP 84 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","We announced the sale of the Debt Management business on the 25th of October, and that transaction will result in a significant simplification of the group.",889
18511,"2016m11","Transaction is subject to a number of closing conditions, including a regulatory approval in the U.",889
18511,"2016m11","and Bahrain, but we expect it to complete by the 31st of March 2017.",889
18511,"2016m11","As a result, we're showing the business line as a discontinued operation.",889
18511,"2016m11","You'll see some of this disclosure in today's full announcement.",889
18511,"2016m11","We said in our announcement that Debt Management has played an important role in the operational efficiency of the group since the strategic review in 2012.",889
18511,"2016m11","Here's a reminder of how far we've come since then.",889
18511,"2016m11","Maintaining an operating cash profit without the Debt Management business will be more of a challenge.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have had the benefit of their contribution in the first half of this financial year, and we will be helped by the good progress of the initiatives and investment in the Infrastructure business as well as continuing focus on generating income in the Private Equity business.",889
18511,"2016m11","And of course, we're still acutely focused on maintaining a lean cost base across the group to mitigate against the leakages of the past.",889
18511,"2016m11","Operating expenses will step down as a result of the Debt Management disposal.",889
18511,"2016m11","The annual direct costs of that business are about GBP 20 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","Improved cost efficiency has been a key part of the reallocation of capital across the group.",889
18511,"2016m11","And you can also see that reallocation in the strength of our balance sheet.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've talked about the increase in portfolio value, which was GBP 5.",889
18511,"2016m11","1 million -- billion, excluding the Debt Management business.",889
18511,"2016m11","Total cash at the 30th of September was GBP 1,031,000,000.",889
18511,"2016m11","If you combine that with the GBP 329 million of undrawn RCF, it means we have liquidity of almost GBP 1.",889
18511,"2016m11","When we repay our Eurobond in March, the gross debt of GBP 844 million will step down by about GBP 270 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","Like our approach to matching investment flows, we are holding euro cash to fund that repayment.",889
18511,"2016m11","Net cash at the 30th of September was GBP 187 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","In line with our policy, which we updated in May, we have declared an 8p interim dividend.",889
18511,"2016m11","And of course, that's half of the 16p base dividend.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our policy change gives us more flexibility when we're setting the additional dividend that we'll pay at the final.",889
18511,"2016m11","With such strong first half performance and a good half for realizations, we have confirmed today that we expect to pay a total dividend for the year of not less than last year's 22p.",889
18511,"2016m11","So this has been a very good first half performance, and it's been underpinned by excellent performance overall from the Private Equity portfolio and good execution from the Infrastructure business.",889
18511,"2016m11","As Simon said in his statement today, the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape continues to be challenging.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our investments, obviously, can't be immune to the markets that they operate in, but we are navigating these challenges from our position of real strength.",889
18511,"2016m11","Thank you, and we'll now take questions.",889
18511,"2016m11","Good morning, and welcome to 3i's interim results.",889
18511,"2016m11","We live in interesting times.",889
18511,"2016m11","But I'm pleased to say that 3i continues to deliver solid results.",889
18511,"2016m11","All 3 of our business lines have performed well in the first half, and we generated a robust performance in our portfolio of investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","Realization flows have remained strong, and we've made interesting new investments in both Private Equity and Infrastructure.",889
18511,"2016m11","The group's financial model continues to work well, and we're enjoying good momentum.",889
18511,"2016m11","You can see what I mean by momentum in these KPIs, which are actually for a 6-month period, not a full year.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our investment portfolio is driving very strong NAV performance and delivering an excellent return on equity.",889
18511,"2016m11","The strong operating cash performance we've generated is underpinned by a robust balance sheet.",889
18511,"2016m11","Julia will give you more details on that in a minute.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our goal remains to deliver attractive proprietary investment profits and growing cash distributions from a cost-efficient platform.",889
18511,"2016m11","On the 25th of October, we announced the sale of our Debt Management division to Invesco.",889
18511,"2016m11","The division has performed well since we bought it in 2011, and AUM has doubled to about $12 billion under 3i's ownership.",889
18511,"2016m11","But Debt Management is a very different business to our 2 other investment divisions, and its annual cash flows are less important to the 3i of today than they were.",889
18511,"2016m11","Once again, our Private Equity business has delivered a very strong performance.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Private Equity team gave us an excellent portfolio performance with a GIR of GBP 1 billion.",889
18511,"2016m11","And we completed a good number of realizations as well as making some interesting new investments at sensible prices.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our portfolio now has 44 companies and 3 listed holdings.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's been good to see strong performance across the portfolio.",889
18511,"2016m11","And apart from Action, the strongest performance came from the assets we purchased since our strategic review in 2012.",889
18511,"2016m11","In all cases, we bought these assets with tight price disciplines, and they've already valued at 1.",889
18511,"2016m11","This compares very well with other funds of that same vintage.",889
18511,"2016m11","You're probably tired of hearing me say it, but Action continues to power on at the same sort of growth rates they produced for the last 5 years.",889
18511,"2016m11","The store opening program has stepped up another gear.",889
18511,"2016m11","And in the last few months, the Action team has celebrated opening its 700th store, it's 750th, and will shortly celebrate its 800th opening.",889
18511,"2016m11","The new stores in all countries are performing consistently well, and they produce returns on capital of over 100% in their first year.",889
18511,"2016m11","Today, if you were to capitalize each new store's profits at any sensible multiple, you can value each store at over EUR 5 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","And it looks like we'll open close to 200 this year.",889
18511,"2016m11","That's outstanding value creation by any measure.",889
18511,"2016m11","And cash flow and like-for-likes remain as strong as you've seen in previous years.",889
18511,"2016m11","The oil and gas sector remains weak all over the world, and that affects the performance of our oil and gas-related assets, namely JMJ and Dynatect.",889
18511,"2016m11","And it's also been a tricky year in retail.",889
18511,"2016m11","Footfall is down, and it's a difficult luxury market.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've taken a write-down in our invest in Agent Provocateur, which is a Eurofund V legacy asset from 2007.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've signaled for some time the impact of a declining luxury spend, but that macro factor has been compounded by an inconsistent store expansion program and some accounting issues we only discovered in August but appear to go back a number of years.",889
18511,"2016m11","Agent Provocateur is our largest write-down in the first half even though it's less than 1% of our portfolio.",889
18511,"2016m11","Moving on, we've had another busy half of realizations.",889
18511,"2016m11","We delivered some GBP 650 million of proceeds at an average multiple of 2.",889
18511,"2016m11","And about 1/3 of that money has come from the more recent investment vintages.",889
18511,"2016m11","Recently, there's been volatility in both sentiment and markets.",889
18511,"2016m11","And that's not making realization activity easy or predictable.",889
18511,"2016m11","But with our very strong start, we feel confident in generating a good level of proceeds for the full year.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've seen a good pickup in our investment pipeline, but we've continued to be careful in our assessment of these targets.",889
18511,"2016m11","In August, we made another new investment in Germany in a company called Schlemmer.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have good experience and expertise in the automotive sector, and Schlemmer is a strong international company with well-developed OEM relationships.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's primed to grow on the back of the accelerating need for more wires and electronics in cars.",889
18511,"2016m11","We also purchased BoConcept in a public-to-private transaction in Denmark.",889
18511,"2016m11","The bulk of the shares were bought from the founding family.",889
18511,"2016m11","BoConcept is a classic Scandinavian style for urban living.",889
18511,"2016m11","The company has a very strong brand for its size and has significant further international potential that's underpinned by strong demographic trends.",889
18511,"2016m11","I suspect a few of you here may enjoy stretching out on your BoConcept sofa at weekends.",889
18511,"2016m11","And for those of you who've yet to experience this, I'm glad to say there's a BoConcept store in Tottenham Court Road.",889
18511,"2016m11","And as some of you have seen, we've just announced the acquisition of Ponroy Santé on Friday last week.",889
18511,"2016m11","Again, this was a purchase from the founding family in a primary buyout.",889
18511,"2016m11","This is a very well-regarded company based in Nantes in France.",889
18511,"2016m11","Ponroy has strong brands, and it sits right on the megatrend of natural health care and well-being.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have ambitious plans to accelerate the growth of this plans -- these brands internationally.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's worth mentioning that the list of potential new investments is strong for both Private Equity and Infrastructure.",889
18511,"2016m11","As a result, we remain very selective.",889
18511,"2016m11","That means we're putting a very sharp focus on any potential investment thesis and on the price-returns balance.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our 4 principal bucket have continued to develop well, with buckets 1 and 2 remaining dominant.",889
18511,"2016m11","The majority of companies in the top 2 buckets are now made up of 2012-plus investments, and that's even after transferring Basic-Fit to bucket 5.",889
18511,"2016m11","Infrastructure is a core division of the group.",889
18511,"2016m11","Let me say that again.",889
18511,"2016m11","Infrastructure is a core division of the group and has had a very good start to the year.",889
18511,"2016m11","And we have real momentum in that division.",889
18511,"2016m11","They've been very active investing, and the team has put together an interesting set of midsized infrastructure investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","They produced excellent returns for 3i group through both portfolio performance and operating cash income.",889
18511,"2016m11","Unlike other 3iN shareholders, we've done very well from the equity placing in June at 165p.",889
18511,"2016m11","One of the reasons behind our recent sale of Debt Management was because of the sound financial position of the group.",889
18511,"2016m11","A lean cost base, strong cash flow and top-tier performance from our 2 main investment divisions give us confidence in delivering strong financial returns as well as good levels of shareholder distributions.",889
18511,"2016m11","And as Julia will explain shortly, given the exceptional performance of the group, we now expect to recommend a total dividend for the year of not less than 22p.",889
18511,"2016m11","So another decent half for 3i against some pretty tricky markets and macroeconomic environment.",889
18511,"2016m11","The overall strength of our portfolio proprietary investments continues to improve, and the group is now in really good shape financially.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have good focus and has a high energy level across all of our teams.",889
18511,"2016m11","We're now better placed to cope with tougher macro conditions and the old bump in the road.",889
18511,"2016m11","And the current momentum in the group should offer the prospect of excellent shareholder returns going forward.",889
18511,"2016m11","So thank you, and I'll now pass over to Julia.",889
18511,"2016m11","Daniel Garrod, Barclays.",889
18511,"2016m11","Couple questions for me.",889
18511,"2016m11","First for Julia, question on the earnings momentum.",889
18511,"2016m11","Appreciate you said you didn't want to provide an average snap, but it only looks like from the buckets detail that you've given a fair chunk has moved into that greater-than-30% earnings growth.",889
18511,"2016m11","I think you spoke in May when you last presented of an expectation that the average of that 8% that you detailed, ex Action, at that point would have been a trough.",889
18511,"2016m11","Do you think you have seen improvement on average? That bucket disclosure would seem to suggest that, but if you can sort of confirm that first.",889
18511,"2016m11","Second question to Simon.",889
18511,"2016m11","You've spoken in the past about sort of your excitement around specifically the Euro-Diesel and Aspen Pumps assets.",889
18511,"2016m11","There are obviously sort of currently less evaluation in your rankings, low valued, but they look very fast growing.",889
18511,"2016m11","You don't detail them in the examples on your sort of 4-, 5-bucket categories, but am I right in presuming they would be bucket 1 category, that these are long-term holds for you? Any comment on that? I think there are a number of levers to pull, and we're obviously more confident about being able to meet that challenge without the Debt Management business.",889
18511,"2016m11","And that was part of the consideration of the timing of that sale.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's not going to come from a new Private Equity fund, but we do on fees when we invest co-investor's money.",889
18511,"2016m11","And in a number of investments we look at, we will look to bring in co-investors with us, as we have done this year.",889
18511,"2016m11","And also in Infrastructure, we have a growing number of initiatives, and 3iN itself is growing very strongly.",889
18511,"2016m11","So we do see a good ramp-up in income across the group, across both sides of that, and a significant reduction in costs as a result of selling Debt Management and a result of taking out one of the long-term debt issues.",889
18511,"2016m11","Any more? Can't tempt you?
Okay, thanks for coming.",889
18511,"2016m11","Really appreciate the time.",889
18511,"2016m11","All right, bye-bye.",889
18511,"2016m11","So let me pick up earnings growth first.",889
18511,"2016m11","[indiscernible] at least a couple of words.",889
18511,"2016m11","If we look at the targeted cash core income, obviously selling the debt business makes that harder.",889
18511,"2016m11","On the other hand, the refi or just getting rid of the Eurobond makes that easier.",889
18511,"2016m11","How important is it to you to be breakeven? If you don't -- if it's really important to you, what levers have you got to pull for that? Or are you just saying to yourselves we're much more robust now with the loading of cash now? If it's there or thereabouts, that's fine.",889
18511,"2016m11","No is the response there.",889
18511,"2016m11","Philip, just behind you.",889
18511,"2016m11","Oh, Iain Scouller.",889
18511,"2016m11","No is the response to that.",889
18511,"2016m11","Yes, please.",889
18511,"2016m11","Iain Scouller from Stifel.",889
18511,"2016m11","Given the continuing strong performance from the investment portfolio, do you have any plans to launch or issue a new LP Private Equity Fund? Hold on.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've got Daniel here.",889
18511,"2016m11","Thank you, Simon.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've had a busy first half of the year and produced an excellent set of results.",889
18511,"2016m11","As you know, we've also sold -- announced the sale of our Debt Management business.",889
18511,"2016m11","In a minute, I'll talk about that transaction and its implications for our numbers.",889
18511,"2016m11","We closed the period with NAV of 551p per share, 19% up from the start of the year.",889
18511,"2016m11","And that's after counting for FY '16's final dividend of 16p.",889
18511,"2016m11","The biggest contribution to that growth was the strong performance from our Private Equity portfolio.",889
18511,"2016m11","Infrastructure progressed well, and it was actually the best 6 months ever for our Debt Management business.",889
18511,"2016m11","Sterling's weakness since the outcome of the Brexit referendum has been a positive for us because 70% of our assets are euro and dollar denominated.",889
18511,"2016m11","While it's good to see FX go the right way for us after several years of losses, the gain is only on translation.",889
18511,"2016m11","To mitigate actual FX exposure, we're holding euros for euro investment and dollars for dollar investment.",889
18511,"2016m11","That way, we can match our large cash flows as much as possible.",889
18511,"2016m11","If you net out carry, costs and last year's final dividend, we get to the 551p per share.",889
18511,"2016m11","So let's look at our Private Equity business, where we have GBP 4.",889
18511,"2016m11","4 billion of our proprietary capital invested.",889
18511,"2016m11","We generated an excellent gross investment return of GBP 989 million, giving a return of 26%.",889
18511,"2016m11","Simon just talked about the realizations in the period, which generated cash proceeds of GBP 654 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","That was over 2x the money invested.",889
18511,"2016m11","The uplift over opening value was 9%, which reflects the timing of the sales of Mayborn and Amor, and GBP 143 million of the proceeds were from the sales of quoted investments such as Quintiles.",889
18511,"2016m11","A big driver of Private Equity's gross investment return was the strength of our portfolio performance and earnings growth.",889
18511,"2016m11","This slide shows you the earnings growth of the 20 large investments, which account for 89% of the total Private Equity portfolio value.",889
18511,"2016m11","You'll see that we've dropped the value-weighted average earnings measure.",889
18511,"2016m11","We now have only 44 unquoted investments and 3 quoted stakes.",889
18511,"2016m11","So talking about averages is less meaningful than talking about individual investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","But the shape of the chart here does show you how well our investments are doing.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's a very good picture with 15 out of the 20 companies showing positive earnings growth and 60% of the total Private Equity portfolio value growing better than 10%.",889
18511,"2016m11","In particular, 3/4 of the investments we made in the last 4 years are in the right-hand 3 bars.",889
18511,"2016m11","Of course, Action is GBP 1.",889
18511,"2016m11","5 billion of the greater-than-30% bar.",889
18511,"2016m11","But even without it, the profile is sound.",889
18511,"2016m11","Investments with negative earnings are the businesses we have been talking about for a while, which continue to be impacted by macro challenges.",889
18511,"2016m11","But I'm pleased to say that a number of companies have moved to the greater-than-30% bucket in the last 6 months.",889
18511,"2016m11","This strong portfolio performance comes through the value growth of GBP 643 million, which you can see here in detail.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have materially increased the value of our investments in Action from GBP 902 million at the 31st of March 2016, to GBP 1.",889
18511,"2016m11","5 billion at the 30th of September.",889
18511,"2016m11","As a lot of you saw at the Capital Markets Day in June, Action continues to perform ahead of expectations.",889
18511,"2016m11","That strong execution is being noticed, and we've had a number of third-party approaches.",889
18511,"2016m11","Needless to say, we decline to discuss any of these propositions.",889
18511,"2016m11","About half of Action's GBP 547 million value gain is because we increased its multiple from 14x at March to 18.",889
18511,"2016m11","2x in June.",889
18511,"2016m11","And given its earnings performance and cash generation, it's already down to 16.",889
18511,"2016m11","8x post discount at September.",889
18511,"2016m11","If you take Action out of the equation, the average multiple came down from 10.",889
18511,"2016m11","7x, and this is principally due to Basic-Fit now being quoted.",889
18511,"2016m11","More generally, we continue to adjust multiples down, where we think that the comparable multiples are ahead of longer-term and sector averages.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our aim is to mitigate some of the market volatility that we might otherwise see.",889
18511,"2016m11","Scandlines is the most significant Private Equity investment that we value on a DCF basis.",889
18511,"2016m11","Its good performance and cash generation is reflected in lower debt and, therefore, in it's weighted average cost of capital, which is used in the discount rate.",889
18511,"2016m11","And that's the main cause of its value increase in this period.",889
18511,"2016m11","Basic-Fit came to market in June this year, and its shares have performed very well since IPO.",889
18511,"2016m11","It accounts for a majority of our quoted uplift of GBP 56 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Agent Provocateur write-down of GBP 39 million is reflected in the other category, and that's because we've taken it off an earnings basis for now.",889
18511,"2016m11","You'll notice that we do not have any investments in the imminent sale category.",889
18511,"2016m11","Although we've announced the signing of an implementation agreement for the sale of ACR, there are a number of regulatory steps to complete.",889
18511,"2016m11","So we've taken a cautious view of valuation at this time.",889
18511,"2016m11","The strong performance of the Private Equity portfolio is reflected in the amount of carry payable and carry receivable that we recognize.",889
18511,"2016m11","A way of reminder, 3i receives carry on the third-party money that we manage, subject to performance conditions.",889
18511,"2016m11","We're already recognizing carry on the growth capital fund.",889
18511,"2016m11","At the year-end, we said that Eurofund V had also gone through its hurdle on an accounting basis.",889
18511,"2016m11","So we're now accruing carry receivable on investments in that fund.",889
18511,"2016m11","The growth in Action and realizations, such as Amor and Geka, are factors in the GBP 203 million we recognized in the first half.",889
18511,"2016m11","We pay carry to our investment teams, past and present, again subject to performance conditions.",889
18511,"2016m11","And we've been through the performance hurdles on most of our schemes on an accounting basis for quite some time.",889
18511,"2016m11","That's all about accounting recognition.",889
18511,"2016m11","We passed an important milestone in the first half.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Amor disposal means that the 2010 to '12 carry payable scheme is now through its hurdle on a cash basis.",889
18511,"2016m11","That means we're now actually paying out carry on this plan, not just accruing for it.",889
18511,"2016m11","That is the main reason why the net cash paid in the period has increased to GBP 54 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","Private Equity's principal contribution to NAV and Group performance is the capital returns from its investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","As you can see here, we've also maintained a good level of portfolio dividend and interest income.",889
18511,"2016m11","As I've said before, this income is asset specific and can vary depending on investment and realization flows.",889
18511,"2016m11","But we will continue to focus on cash portfolio income, where it makes sense to do so.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our Infrastructure team have had a particularly busy 6 months.",889
18511,"2016m11","They raised equity for 3i Infrastructure plc and had a lot of investing activity, including new investments such as TCR and WIG.",889
18511,"2016m11","3iN shares performed very strongly, increasing by more than 15% compared to its equity issue price.",889
18511,"2016m11","The increase in 3iN share price accounts for GBP 80 million of the GBP 90 million in our gross investment return.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Infrastructure business also makes an important contribution to cash income through fees and dividends.",889
18511,"2016m11","And we expect the returns from Infrastructure to be a more meaningful component of our operating cash profit in the future.",889
18511,"2016m11","That's particularly after the sale of Debt Management completes.",889
18511,"2016m11","Before talking about that transaction, I'd like to show you the contribution that the Debt Management business has made in this 6-month period.",889
18511,"2016m11","The team have also been busy with the launch of 2 new CLOs in Europe and 1 in the U.",889
18511,"2016m11","In fact, they added GBP 1 billion to their AUM.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's a particularly strong 6 months for the valuation of our CLO equity investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","One reason for that is the generally improved investor sentiment, meaning we recognize value growth of GBP 13 million, and that's despite also receiving GBP 24 million of distributions in the same period, which is included in the total cash income of GBP 50 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","After allowing for the businesses' direct costs of GBP 12 million, the net contribution to our total return was GBP 84 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","We announced the sale of the Debt Management business on the 25th of October, and that transaction will result in a significant simplification of the Group.",889
18511,"2016m11","Transaction is subject to a number of closing conditions, including a regulatory approval in the U.",889
18511,"2016m11","and Bahrain, but we expect it to complete by the 31st of March 2017.",889
18511,"2016m11","As a result, we're showing the business line as a discontinued operation.",889
18511,"2016m11","You'll see some of this disclosure in today's full announcement.",889
18511,"2016m11","We said in our announcement that Debt Management has played an important role in the operational efficiency of the Group since the strategic review in 2012.",889
18511,"2016m11","Here's a reminder of how far we've come since then.",889
18511,"2016m11","Maintaining an operating cash profit without the Debt Management business will be more of a challenge.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have had the benefit of their contribution in the first half of this financial year, and we will be helped by the good progress of the initiatives and investment in the Infrastructure business as well as continuing focus on generating income in the Private Equity business.",889
18511,"2016m11","And of course, we're still acutely focused on maintaining a lean cost base across the Group to mitigate against the leakages of the past.",889
18511,"2016m11","Operating expenses will step down as a result of the Debt Management disposal.",889
18511,"2016m11","The annual direct costs of that business are about GBP 20 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","Improved cost efficiency has been a key part of the reallocation of capital across the Group.",889
18511,"2016m11","And you can also see that reallocation in the strength of our balance sheet.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've talked about the increase in portfolio value, which was GBP 5.",889
18511,"2016m11","1 million -- billion, excluding the Debt Management business.",889
18511,"2016m11","Total cash at the 30th of September was GBP 1,031,000,000.",889
18511,"2016m11","If you combine that with the GBP 329 million of undrawn RCF, it means we have liquidity of almost GBP 1.",889
18511,"2016m11","When we repay our eurobond in March, the gross debt of GBP 844 million will step down by about GBP 270 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","Like our approach to matching investment flows, we are holding euro cash to fund that repayment.",889
18511,"2016m11","Net cash at the 30th of September was GBP 187 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","In line with our policy, which we updated in May, we have declared an 8p interim dividend.",889
18511,"2016m11","And of course, that's half of the 16p base dividend.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our policy change gives us more flexibility when we're setting the additional dividend that we'll pay at the final.",889
18511,"2016m11","With such strong first half performance and a good half for realizations, we have confirmed today that we expect to pay a total dividend for the year of not less than last year's 22p.",889
18511,"2016m11","So this has been a very good first half performance, and it's been underpinned by excellent performance overall from the Private Equity portfolio and good execution from the Infrastructure business.",889
18511,"2016m11","As Simon said in his statement today, the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape continues to be challenging.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our investments, obviously, can't be immune to the markets that they operate in, but we are navigating these challenges from our position of real strength.",889
18511,"2016m11","Thank you, and we'll now take questions.",889
18511,"2016m11","If I could safely [ph]  tempt you into at least a couple of words.",889
18511,"2016m11","If we look at the targeted cash core income, obviously selling the debt business makes that harder.",889
18511,"2016m11","On the other hand, the refi or just getting rid of the eurobond makes that easier.",889
18511,"2016m11","How important is it to you to be breakeven? If you don't -- if it's really important to you, what levers have you got to pull for that? Or are you just saying to yourselves, ""We're much more robust, we can load in that cash now?"" If it's there or thereabouts, that's fine.",889
18511,"2016m11","Good morning, and welcome to 3i's Interim Results.",889
18511,"2016m11","We live in interesting times.",889
18511,"2016m11","But I'm pleased to say that 3i continues to deliver solid results.",889
18511,"2016m11","All 3 of our business lines have performed well in the first half, and we generated a robust performance in our portfolio of investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","Realization flows have remained strong, and we've made interesting new investments in both Private Equity and Infrastructure.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Group's financial model continues to work well, and we're enjoying good momentum.",889
18511,"2016m11","You can see what I mean by momentum in these KPIs, which are actually for a 6-month period, not a full year.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our investment portfolio is driving very strong NAV performance and delivering an excellent return on equity.",889
18511,"2016m11","The strong operating cash performance we've generated is underpinned by a robust balance sheet.",889
18511,"2016m11","Julia will give you more details on that in a minute.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our goal remains to deliver attractive proprietary investment profits and growing cash distributions from a cost-efficient platform.",889
18511,"2016m11","On the 25th of October, we announced the sale of our Debt Management division to Invescorp.",889
18511,"2016m11","The division has performed well since we bought it in 2011, and AUM has doubled to about $12 billion under 3i's ownership.",889
18511,"2016m11","But Debt Management is a very different business to our 2 other investment divisions, and its annual cash flows are less important to the 3i of today than they were.",889
18511,"2016m11","Once again, our Private Equity business has delivered a very strong performance.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Private Equity team gave us an excellent portfolio performance with a GIR of GBP 1 billion.",889
18511,"2016m11","And we completed a good number of realizations as well as making some interesting new investments at sensible prices.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our portfolio now has 44 companies and 3 listed holdings.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's been good to see strong performance across the portfolio.",889
18511,"2016m11","And apart from Action, the strongest performance came from the assets we purchased since our strategic review in 2012.",889
18511,"2016m11","In all cases, we bought these assets with tight price disciplines, and they've already valued at 1.",889
18511,"2016m11","This compares very well with other funds of that same vintage.",889
18511,"2016m11","You're probably tired of hearing me say it, but Action continues to power on at the same sort of growth rates they produced for the last 5 years.",889
18511,"2016m11","The store opening program has stepped up another gear.",889
18511,"2016m11","And in the last few months, the Action team has celebrated opening its 700th store, it's 750th, and will shortly celebrate its 800th opening.",889
18511,"2016m11","The new stores in all countries are performing consistently well, and they produce returns on capital of over 100% in their first year.",889
18511,"2016m11","Today, if you were to capitalize each new store's profits at any sensible multiple, you can value each store at over EUR 5 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","And it looks like we'll open close to 200 this year.",889
18511,"2016m11","That's outstanding value creation by any measure.",889
18511,"2016m11","And cash flow and like-for-likes remain as strong as you've seen in previous years.",889
18511,"2016m11","The oil and gas sector remains weak all over the world, and that affects the performance of our oil and gas-related assets, namely JMJ and Dynatect.",889
18511,"2016m11","And it's also been a tricky year in retail.",889
18511,"2016m11","Footfall is down, and it's a difficult luxury market.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've taken a write-down on our investment in Agent Provocateur, which is a Eurofund V legacy asset from 2007.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've signaled for some time the impact of a declining luxury spend, but that macro factor has been compounded by an inconsistent store expansion program and some accounting issues we only discovered in August but appear to go back a number of years.",889
18511,"2016m11","Agent Provocateur is our largest write-down in the first half even though it's less than 1% of our portfolio.",889
18511,"2016m11","Moving on, we've had another busy half of realizations.",889
18511,"2016m11","We delivered some GBP 650 million of proceeds, an average multiple of 2.",889
18511,"2016m11","And about 1/3 of that money has come from the more recent investment vintages.",889
18511,"2016m11","Recently, there's been volatility in both sentiment and markets.",889
18511,"2016m11","And that's not making realization activity easy or predictable.",889
18511,"2016m11","But with our very strong start, we feel confident in generating a good level of proceeds for the full year.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've seen a good pickup in our investment pipeline, but we've continued to be careful in our assessment of these targets.",889
18511,"2016m11","In August, we made another new investment in Germany in a company called Schlemmer.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have good experience and expertise in the automotive sector, and Schlemmer is a strong international company with well-developed OEM relationships.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's primed to grow on the back of the accelerating need for more wires and electronics in cars.",889
18511,"2016m11","We also purchased BoConcept in a public-to-private transaction in Denmark.",889
18511,"2016m11","The bulk of the shares were bought from the founding family.",889
18511,"2016m11","BoConcept is a classic Scandinavian style for urban living.",889
18511,"2016m11","The company has a very strong brand for its size and has significant further international potential that's underpinned by strong demographic trends.",889
18511,"2016m11","I suspect a few of you here may enjoy stretching out on your BoConcept sofa at weekends.",889
18511,"2016m11","And for those of you who've yet to experience this, I'm glad to say there's a BoConcept store in Tottenham Court Road.",889
18511,"2016m11","And as some of you have seen, we've just announced the acquisition of Ponroy Santé on Friday last week.",889
18511,"2016m11","Again, this was a purchase from the founding family in a primary buyout.",889
18511,"2016m11","This is a very well-regarded company based in Nantes in France.",889
18511,"2016m11","Ponroy has strong brands, and it sits right on the megatrend of natural health care and well-being.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have ambitious plans to accelerate the growth of this plans -- these brands internationally.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's worth mentioning that the list of potential new investments is strong for both Private Equity and Infrastructure.",889
18511,"2016m11","As a result, we remain very selective.",889
18511,"2016m11","That means we are putting a very sharp focus on any potential investment thesis and on the price-returns balance.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our 4 principal buckets have continued to develop well, with buckets 1 and 2 remaining dominant.",889
18511,"2016m11","The majority of companies in the top 2 buckets are now made up of 2012-plus investments, and that's even after transferring Basic-Fit to bucket 5.",889
18511,"2016m11","Infrastructure is a core division of the Group.",889
18511,"2016m11","Let me say that again.",889
18511,"2016m11","Infrastructure is a core division of the Group and has had a very good start to the year.",889
18511,"2016m11","And we have real momentum in that division.",889
18511,"2016m11","They've been very active investing, and the team has put together an interesting set of mid-sized infrastructure investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","They produced excellent returns for 3i Group through both portfolio performance and operating cash income.",889
18511,"2016m11","Unlike other 3iN shareholders, we've done very well from the equity placing in June at 165p.",889
18511,"2016m11","One of the reasons behind our recent sale of Debt Management was because of the sound financial position of the Group.",889
18511,"2016m11","A lean cost base, strong cash flow and top-tier performance from our 2 main investment divisions give us confidence in delivering strong financial returns as well as good levels of shareholder distributions.",889
18511,"2016m11","And as Julia will explain shortly, given the exceptional performance of the Group, we now expect to recommend a total dividend for the year of not less than 22p.",889
18511,"2016m11","So another decent half for 3i against some pretty tricky markets and macroeconomic environment.",889
18511,"2016m11","The overall strength of our portfolio proprietary investments continues to improve, and the Group is now in really good shape financially.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have good focus and has a high energy level across all of our teams.",889
18511,"2016m11","We're now better placed to cope with tougher macro conditions and the old bump in the road.",889
18511,"2016m11","And the current momentum in the Group should offer the prospect of excellent shareholder returns going forward.",889
18511,"2016m11","So thank you, and I'll now pass over to Julia.",889
18511,"2016m11","I think there are a number of levers to pull, and we're obviously more confident about being able to meet that challenge without the Debt Management business.",889
18511,"2016m11","And that was part of the consideration of the timing of that sale.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's not going to come from a new Private Equity fund, but we do on fees when we invest co-investor's money.",889
18511,"2016m11","And in a number of investments we look at, we will look to bring in co-investors with us, as we have done this year.",889
18511,"2016m11","And also in Infrastructure, we have a growing number of initiatives, and 3iN itself is growing very strongly.",889
18511,"2016m11","So we do see a good ramp-up in income across the Group, across both sides of that, and a significant reduction in costs as a result of selling Debt Management and a result of taking out one of the long-term debt issues.",889
18511,"2016m11","Any more? Can't tempt you?
Okay, thanks for coming.",889
18511,"2016m11","Really appreciate the time.",889
18511,"2016m11","All right, bye-bye.",889
18511,"2016m11","So let me pick up earnings growth first.",889
18511,"2016m11","Daniel Garrod, Barclays.",889
18511,"2016m11","Couple questions for me.",889
18511,"2016m11","First for Julia, question on the earnings momentum.",889
18511,"2016m11","Appreciate you said you didn't want to provide an average snap, but it only looks like from the buckets detail that you've given, a fair chunk has moved into that greater-than-30% earnings growth.",889
18511,"2016m11","I think you spoke in May when you last presented of an expectation that the average of that 8% that you detailed, ex Action, at that point would have been a trough.",889
18511,"2016m11","Do you think you have seen improvement on average, that bucket disclosure would seem to suggest that, but if you can sort of confirm that first? 
Second question to Simon.",889
18511,"2016m11","You've spoken in the past about sort of your excitement around specifically the Euro-Diesel and Aspen Pumps assets.",889
18511,"2016m11","There are obviously sort of currently less evaluation in your rankings, low valued, but they look very fast growing.",889
18511,"2016m11","You don't detail them in the examples on your sort of 4-, 5-bucket categories, but am I right in presuming they would be bucket 1 category, that these are long-term holds for you? Any comments on that? Philip, just behind you.",889
18511,"2016m11","Iain Scouller.",889
18511,"2016m11","So yes, just to reassure you, there's nothing sinister in deciding not to disclose a weighted average value measure.",889
18511,"2016m11","As we talked about at the year-end, it just becomes more idiosyncratic looking at different movements of the relative populations.",889
18511,"2016m11","But you're right, as I had indicated, we've gotten a number more companies, 6 companies, in that greater-than-30% growth bucket.",889
18511,"2016m11","We particularly saw actually the 2 companies you just referred to, Euro-Diesel and Aspen Pumps, and a number of the more recent investments in the second quarter in particular starting to come through much more strongly in terms of earnings growth.",889
18511,"2016m11","So you're about right in your assumptions.",889
18511,"2016m11","Daniel Garrod, Barclays.",889
18511,"2016m11","Couple questions for me.",889
18511,"2016m11","First for Julia, question on the earnings momentum.",889

18511,"2016m11","So you're about right in your assumptions.",889
18511,"2016m11","No is the response to that.",889
18511,"2016m11","So let me pick up earnings growth first.",889
18511,"2016m11","Thank you, Simon.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've had a busy first half of the year and produced an excellent set of results.",889
18511,"2016m11","As you know, we've also sold -- announced the sale of our Debt Management business.",889
18511,"2016m11","In a minute, I'll talk about that transaction and its implications for our numbers.",889
18511,"2016m11","We closed the period with NAV of 551p per share, 19% up from the start of the year.",889
18511,"2016m11","And that's after counting for FY '16's final dividend of 16p.",889
18511,"2016m11","The biggest contribution to that growth was the strong performance from our Private Equity portfolio.",889
18511,"2016m11","Infrastructure progressed well, and it was actually the best 6 months ever for our Debt Management business.",889
18511,"2016m11","Sterling's weakness since the outcome of the Brexit referendum has been a positive for us because 70% of our assets are euro and dollar denominated.",889
18511,"2016m11","While it's good to see FX go the right way for us after several years of losses, the gain is only on translation.",889
18511,"2016m11","To mitigate actual FX exposure, we're holding euros for euro investment and dollars for dollar investment.",889
18511,"2016m11","That way, we can match our large cash flows as much as possible.",889
18511,"2016m11","If you net out carry, costs and last year's final dividend, we get to the 551p per share.",889
18511,"2016m11","So let's look at our Private Equity business, where we have GBP 4.",889
18511,"2016m11","4 billion of our proprietary capital invested.",889
18511,"2016m11","We generated an excellent gross investment return of GBP 989 million, giving a return of 26%.",889
18511,"2016m11","Simon just talked about the realizations in the period, which generated cash proceeds of GBP 654 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","That was over 2x the money invested.",889
18511,"2016m11","The uplift over opening value was 9%, which reflects the timing of the sales of Mayborn and Amor, and GBP 143 million of the proceeds were from the sales of quoted investments such as Quintiles.",889
18511,"2016m11","A big driver of Private Equity's gross investment return was the strength of our portfolio performance and earnings growth.",889
18511,"2016m11","This slide shows you the earnings growth of the 20 large investments, which account for 89% of the total Private Equity portfolio value.",889
18511,"2016m11","You'll see that we've dropped the value-weighted average earnings measure.",889
18511,"2016m11","We now have only 44 unquoted investments and 3 quoted stakes.",889
18511,"2016m11","So talking about averages is less meaningful than talking about individual investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","But the shape of the chart here does show you how well our investments are doing.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's a very good picture with 15 out of the 20 companies showing positive earnings growth and 60% of the total Private Equity portfolio value growing better than 10%.",889
18511,"2016m11","In particular, 3/4 of the investments we made in the last 4 years are in the right-hand 3 bars.",889
18511,"2016m11","Of course, Action is GBP 1.",889
18511,"2016m11","5 billion of the greater-than-30% bar.",889
18511,"2016m11","But even without it, the profile is sound.",889
18511,"2016m11","Investments with negative earnings are the businesses we have been talking about for a while, which continue to be impacted by macro challenges.",889
18511,"2016m11","But I'm pleased to say that a number of companies have moved to the greater-than-30% bucket in the last 6 months.",889
18511,"2016m11","This strong portfolio performance comes through the value growth of GBP 643 million, which you can see here in detail.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have materially increased the value of our investments in Action from GBP 902 million at the 31st of March 2016, to GBP 1.",889
18511,"2016m11","5 billion at the 30th of September.",889
18511,"2016m11","As a lot of you saw at the Capital Markets Day in June, Action continues to perform ahead of expectations.",889
18511,"2016m11","That strong execution is being noticed, and we've had a number of third-party approaches.",889
18511,"2016m11","Needless to say, we decline to discuss any of these propositions.",889
18511,"2016m11","About half of Action's GBP 547 million value gain is because we increased its multiple from 14x at March to 18.",889
18511,"2016m11","2x in June.",889
18511,"2016m11","And given its earnings performance and cash generation, it's already down to 16.",889
18511,"2016m11","8x post discount at September.",889
18511,"2016m11","If you take Action out of the equation, the average multiple came down from 10.",889
18511,"2016m11","7x, and this is principally due to Basic-Fit now being quoted.",889
18511,"2016m11","More generally, we continue to adjust multiples down, where we think that the comparable multiples are ahead of longer-term and sector averages.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our aim is to mitigate some of the market volatility that we might otherwise see.",889
18511,"2016m11","Scandlines is the most significant Private Equity investment that we value on a DCF basis.",889
18511,"2016m11","Its good performance and cash generation is reflected in lower debt and, therefore, in its weighted average cost of capital, which is used in the discount rate.",889
18511,"2016m11","And that's the main cause of its value increase in this period.",889
18511,"2016m11","Basic-Fit came to market in June this year, and its shares have performed very well since IPO.",889
18511,"2016m11","It accounts for a majority of our quoted uplift of GBP 56 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Agent Provocateur write-down of GBP 39 million is reflected in the other category, and that's because we've taken it off an earnings basis for now.",889
18511,"2016m11","You'll notice that we do not have any investments in the imminent sale category.",889
18511,"2016m11","Although we've announced the signing of an implementation agreement for the sale of ACR, there are a number of regulatory steps to complete.",889
18511,"2016m11","So we've taken a cautious view of valuation at this time.",889
18511,"2016m11","The strong performance of the Private Equity portfolio is reflected in the amount of carry payable and carry receivable that we recognize.",889
18511,"2016m11","A way of reminder, 3i receives carry on the third-party money that we manage, subject to performance conditions.",889
18511,"2016m11","We're already recognizing carry on the growth capital fund.",889
18511,"2016m11","At the year-end, we said that Eurofund V had also gone through its hurdle on an accounting basis.",889
18511,"2016m11","So we're now accruing carry receivable on investments in that fund.",889
18511,"2016m11","The growth in Action and realizations, such as Amor and Geka, are factors in the GBP 203 million we recognized in the first half.",889
18511,"2016m11","We pay carry to our investment teams, past and present, again subject to performance conditions.",889
18511,"2016m11","And we've been through the performance hurdles on most of our schemes on an accounting basis for quite some time.",889
18511,"2016m11","That's all about accounting recognition.",889
18511,"2016m11","We passed an important milestone in the first half.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Amor disposal means that the 2010 to '12 carry payable scheme is now through its hurdle on a cash basis.",889
18511,"2016m11","That means we're now actually paying out carry on this plan, not just accruing for it.",889
18511,"2016m11","That is the main reason why the net cash paid in the period has increased to GBP 54 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","Private Equity's principal contribution to NAV and group performance is the capital returns from its investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","As you can see here, we've also maintained a good level of portfolio dividend and interest income.",889
18511,"2016m11","As I've said before, this income is asset specific and can vary depending on investment and realization flows.",889
18511,"2016m11","But we will continue to focus on cash portfolio income, where it makes sense to do so.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our Infrastructure team have had a particularly busy 6 months.",889
18511,"2016m11","They raised equity for 3i Infrastructure plc and had a lot of investing activity, including new investments such as TCR and WIG.",889
18511,"2016m11","3iN shares performed very strongly, increasing by more than 15% compared to its equity issue price.",889
18511,"2016m11","The increase in 3iN share price accounts for GBP 80 million of the GBP 90 million in our gross investment return.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Infrastructure business also makes an important contribution to cash income through fees and dividends.",889
18511,"2016m11","And we expect the returns from Infrastructure to be a more meaningful component of our operating cash profit in the future.",889
18511,"2016m11","That's particularly after the sale of Debt Management completes.",889
18511,"2016m11","Before talking about that transaction, I'd like to show you the contribution that the Debt Management business has made in this 6-month period.",889
18511,"2016m11","The team have also been busy with the launch of 2 new CLOs in Europe and 1 in the U.",889
18511,"2016m11","In fact, they added GBP 1 billion to their AUM.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's a particularly strong 6 months for the valuation of our CLO equity investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","One reason for that is the generally improved investor sentiment, meaning we recognize value growth of GBP 13 million, and that's despite also receiving GBP 24 million of distributions in the same period, which is included in the total cash income of GBP 50 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","After allowing for the businesses' direct costs of GBP 12 million, the net contribution to our total return was GBP 84 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","We announced the sale of the Debt Management business on the 25th of October, and that transaction will result in a significant simplification of the group.",889
18511,"2016m11","Transaction is subject to a number of closing conditions, including a regulatory approval in the U.",889
18511,"2016m11","and Bahrain, but we expect it to complete by the 31st of March 2017.",889
18511,"2016m11","As a result, we're showing the business line as a discontinued operation.",889
18511,"2016m11","You'll see some of this disclosure in today's full announcement.",889
18511,"2016m11","We said in our announcement that Debt Management has played an important role in the operational efficiency of the group since the strategic review in 2012.",889
18511,"2016m11","Here's a reminder of how far we've come since then.",889
18511,"2016m11","Maintaining an operating cash profit without the Debt Management business will be more of a challenge.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have had the benefit of their contribution in the first half of this financial year, and we will be helped by the good progress of the initiatives and investment in the Infrastructure business as well as continuing focus on generating income in the Private Equity business.",889
18511,"2016m11","And of course, we're still acutely focused on maintaining a lean cost base across the group to mitigate against the leakages of the past.",889
18511,"2016m11","Operating expenses will step down as a result of the Debt Management disposal.",889
18511,"2016m11","The annual direct costs of that business are about GBP 20 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","Improved cost efficiency has been a key part of the reallocation of capital across the group.",889
18511,"2016m11","And you can also see that reallocation in the strength of our balance sheet.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've talked about the increase in portfolio value, which was GBP 5.",889
18511,"2016m11","1 million -- billion, excluding the Debt Management business.",889
18511,"2016m11","Total cash at the 30th of September was GBP 1,031,000,000.",889
18511,"2016m11","If you combine that with the GBP 329 million of undrawn RCF, it means we have liquidity of almost GBP 1.",889
18511,"2016m11","When we repay our eurobond in March, the gross debt of GBP 844 million will step down by about GBP 270 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","Like our approach to matching investment flows, we are holding euro cash to fund that repayment.",889
18511,"2016m11","Net cash at the 30th of September was GBP 187 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","In line with our policy, which we updated in May, we have declared an 8p interim dividend.",889
18511,"2016m11","And of course, that's half of the 16p base dividend.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our policy change gives us more flexibility when we're setting the additional dividend that we'll pay at the final.",889
18511,"2016m11","With such strong first half performance and a good half for realizations, we have confirmed today that we expect to pay a total dividend for the year of not less than last year's 22p.",889
18511,"2016m11","So this has been a very good first half performance, and it's been underpinned by excellent performance overall from the Private Equity portfolio and good execution from the Infrastructure business.",889
18511,"2016m11","As Simon said in his statement today, the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape continues to be challenging.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our investments, obviously, can't be immune to the markets that they operate in, but we are navigating these challenges from our position of real strength.",889
18511,"2016m11","Thank you, and we'll now take questions.",889
18511,"2016m11","If I could safely [ph] tempt you into at least a couple of words.",889
18511,"2016m11","If we look at the targeted cash core income, obviously selling the debt business makes that harder.",889
18511,"2016m11","On the other hand, the refi or just getting rid of the eurobond makes that easier.",889
18511,"2016m11","How important is it to you to be breakeven? If you don't -- if it's really important to you, what levers have you got to pull for that? Or are you just saying to yourselves, ""We're much more robust, we can load in that cash now?"" If it's there or thereabouts, that's fine.",889
18511,"2016m11","Yes, please.",889
18511,"2016m11","Philip, just behind you.",889
18511,"2016m11","Iain Scouller.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've got Daniel here.",889
18511,"2016m11","Iain Scouller from Stifel.",889
18511,"2016m11","Given the continuing strong performance from the investment portfolio, do you have any plans to launch or issue a new LP Private Equity Fund? Good morning, and welcome to 3i's interim results.",889
18511,"2016m11","We live in interesting times.",889
18511,"2016m11","But I'm pleased to say that 3i continues to deliver solid results.",889
18511,"2016m11","All 3 of our business lines have performed well in the first half, and we generated a robust performance in our portfolio of investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","Realization flows have remained strong, and we've made interesting new investments in both Private Equity and Infrastructure.",889
18511,"2016m11","The group's financial model continues to work well, and we're enjoying good momentum.",889
18511,"2016m11","You can see what I mean by momentum in these KPIs, which are actually for a 6-month period, not a full year.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our investment portfolio is driving very strong NAV performance and delivering an excellent return on equity.",889
18511,"2016m11","The strong operating cash performance we've generated is underpinned by a robust balance sheet.",889
18511,"2016m11","Julia will give you more details on that in a minute.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our goal remains to deliver attractive proprietary investment profits and growing cash distributions from a cost-efficient platform.",889
18511,"2016m11","On the 25th of October, we announced the sale of our Debt Management division to Invescorp.",889
18511,"2016m11","The division has performed well since we bought it in 2011, and AUM has doubled to about $12 billion under 3i's ownership.",889
18511,"2016m11","But Debt Management is a very different business to our 2 other investment divisions, and its annual cash flows are less important to the 3i of today than they were.",889
18511,"2016m11","Once again, our Private Equity business has delivered a very strong performance.",889
18511,"2016m11","The Private Equity team gave us an excellent portfolio performance with a GIR of GBP 1 billion.",889
18511,"2016m11","And we completed a good number of realizations as well as making some interesting new investments at sensible prices.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our portfolio now has 44 companies and 3 listed holdings.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's been good to see strong performance across the portfolio.",889
18511,"2016m11","And apart from Action, the strongest performance came from the assets we purchased since our strategic review in 2012.",889
18511,"2016m11","In all cases, we bought these assets with tight price disciplines, and they've already valued at 1.",889
18511,"2016m11","This compares very well with other funds of that same vintage.",889
18511,"2016m11","You're probably tired of hearing me say it, but Action continues to power on at the same sort of growth rates they produced for the last 5 years.",889
18511,"2016m11","The store opening program has stepped up another gear.",889
18511,"2016m11","And in the last few months, the Action team has celebrated opening its 700th store, it's 750th, and will shortly celebrate its 800th opening.",889
18511,"2016m11","The new stores in all countries are performing consistently well, and they produce returns on capital of over 100% in their first year.",889
18511,"2016m11","Today, if you were to capitalize each new store's profits at any sensible multiple, you can value each store at over EUR 5 million.",889
18511,"2016m11","And it looks like we'll open close to 200 this year.",889
18511,"2016m11","That's outstanding value creation by any measure.",889
18511,"2016m11","And cash flow and like-for-likes remain as strong as you've seen in previous years.",889
18511,"2016m11","The oil and gas sector remains weak all over the world, and that affects the performance of our oil and gas-related assets, namely JMJ and Dynatect.",889
18511,"2016m11","And it's also been a tricky year in retail.",889
18511,"2016m11","Footfall is down, and it's a difficult luxury market.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've taken a write-down on our investment in Agent Provocateur, which is a Eurofund V legacy asset from 2007.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've signaled for some time the impact of a declining luxury spend, but that macro factor has been compounded by an inconsistent store expansion program and some accounting issues we only discovered in August but appear to go back a number of years.",889
18511,"2016m11","Agent Provocateur is our largest write-down in the first half even though it's less than 1% of our portfolio.",889
18511,"2016m11","Moving on, we've had another busy half of realizations.",889
18511,"2016m11","We delivered some GBP 650 million of proceeds, an average multiple of 2.",889
18511,"2016m11","And about 1/3 of that money has come from the more recent investment vintages.",889
18511,"2016m11","Recently, there's been volatility in both sentiment and markets.",889
18511,"2016m11","And that's not making realization activity easy or predictable.",889
18511,"2016m11","But with our very strong start, we feel confident in generating a good level of proceeds for the full year.",889
18511,"2016m11","We've seen a good pickup in our investment pipeline, but we've continued to be careful in our assessment of these targets.",889
18511,"2016m11","In August, we made another new investment in Germany in a company called Schlemmer.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have good experience and expertise in the automotive sector, and Schlemmer is a strong international company with well-developed OEM relationships.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's primed to grow on the back of the accelerating need for more wires and electronics in cars.",889
18511,"2016m11","We also purchased BoConcept in a public-to-private transaction in Denmark.",889
18511,"2016m11","The bulk of the shares were bought from the founding family.",889
18511,"2016m11","BoConcept is a classic Scandinavian style for urban living.",889
18511,"2016m11","The company has a very strong brand for its size and has significant further international potential that's underpinned by strong demographic trends.",889
18511,"2016m11","I suspect a few of you here may enjoy stretching out on your BoConcept sofa at weekends.",889
18511,"2016m11","And for those of you who've yet to experience this, I'm glad to say there's a BoConcept store in Tottenham Court Road.",889
18511,"2016m11","And as some of you have seen, we've just announced the acquisition of Ponroy Santé on Friday last week.",889
18511,"2016m11","Again, this was a purchase from the founding family in a primary buyout.",889
18511,"2016m11","This is a very well-regarded company based in Nantes in France.",889
18511,"2016m11","Ponroy has strong brands, and it sits right on the megatrend of natural health care and well-being.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have ambitious plans to accelerate the growth of this plans -- these brands internationally.",889
18511,"2016m11","It's worth mentioning that the list of potential new investments is strong for both Private Equity and Infrastructure.",889
18511,"2016m11","As a result, we remain very selective.",889
18511,"2016m11","That means we are putting a very sharp focus on any potential investment thesis and on the price-returns balance.",889
18511,"2016m11","Our 4 principal buckets have continued to develop well, with buckets 1 and 2 remaining dominant.",889
18511,"2016m11","The majority of companies in the top 2 buckets are now made up of 2012-plus investments, and that's even after transferring Basic-Fit to bucket 5.",889
18511,"2016m11","Infrastructure is a core division of the group.",889
18511,"2016m11","Let me say that again.",889
18511,"2016m11","Infrastructure is a core division of the group and has had a very good start to the year.",889
18511,"2016m11","And we have real momentum in that division.",889
18511,"2016m11","They've been very active investing, and the team has put together an interesting set of mid-sized infrastructure investments.",889
18511,"2016m11","They produced excellent returns for 3i Group through both portfolio performance and operating cash income.",889
18511,"2016m11","Unlike other 3iN shareholders, we've done very well from the equity placing in June at 165p.",889
18511,"2016m11","One of the reasons behind our recent sale of Debt Management was because of the sound financial position of the group.",889
18511,"2016m11","A lean cost base, strong cash flow and top-tier performance from our 2 main investment divisions give us confidence in delivering strong financial returns as well as good levels of shareholder distributions.",889
18511,"2016m11","And as Julia will explain shortly, given the exceptional performance of the group, we now expect to recommend a total dividend for the year of not less than 22p.",889
18511,"2016m11","So another decent half for 3i against some pretty tricky markets and macroeconomic environment.",889
18511,"2016m11","The overall strength of our portfolio proprietary investments continues to improve, and the group is now in really good shape financially.",889
18511,"2016m11","We have good focus and has a high energy level across all of our teams.",889
18511,"2016m11","We're now better placed to cope with tougher macro conditions and the old bump in the road.",889
18511,"2016m11","And the current momentum in the group should offer the prospect of excellent shareholder returns going forward.",889
18511,"2016m11","So thank you, and I'll now pass over to Julia.",889
18511,"2016m5","Daniel? Thank you, Simon.",760
18511,"2016m5","As you just heard, this has been an excellent year for 3i.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our financial performance provides evidence of the resilience of our operating and business model even against a background of volatility and uncertainty in those markets that Simon has talked about.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we continue to execute our well-defined strategy.",760
18511,"2016m5","We closed the year with very strong performance in the final quarter.",760
18511,"2016m5","We delivered NAV per share of 463p and a 21.",760
18511,"2016m5","7% return on our opening net assets.",760
18511,"2016m5","The main drivers of NAV growth contributing 77p was solid portfolio performance and successful realizations.",760
18511,"2016m5","That performance is also reflected in the increase in net carry payables with an 11p impact.",760
18511,"2016m5","We benefited from Sterling's weakness, which gave us a net 16p translation gain in the year.",760
18511,"2016m5","And finally, we paid total dividends of 20p in the year.",760
18511,"2016m5","Now I know some of you like the bridge for the quarter 2, so that's in the back of the pack.",760
18511,"2016m5","The Private Equity business had a very good year.",760
18511,"2016m5","They generated growth investment return of over GBP 1 billion or 32% of opening portfolio value.",760
18511,"2016m5","And that's an excellent performance, especially in these market conditions.",760
18511,"2016m5","P/E realizations of GBP 743 million include 11 smaller and older assets and GBP 179 million from the sale of Element.",760
18511,"2016m5","It was one of our largest assets, and the sale was at a money multiple of 3.",760
18511,"2016m5","The uplift of 14% is lower than last year, and that just reflects the fact that GBP 111 million of the proceeds were from sales of our quoted investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","And the weight of the transactions was early in the year, so most of the exit value had been reflected in the opening NAV.",760
18511,"2016m5","So we are continuing to make good progress in reshaping the portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we put a slide in the back of the pack to give you full details of all the realizations.",760
18511,"2016m5","Now, although the total number of investments reduced, the Private Equity portfolio value increased to GBP 3.",760
18511,"2016m5","7 billion, supported by a number of material value increases in our largest assets.",760
18511,"2016m5","On a really positive note, the GBP 690 million of unrealized value growth is underpinned by the performance of the portfolio, that is earnings growth and changes in net debt.",760
18511,"2016m5","The performance of assets valued on an earnings basis accounted for GBP 460 million of the uplift, and they had value weighted average earnings growth of 17%.",760
18511,"2016m5","If you exclude Action with this earnings growth of over 30%, the average is of 7%.",760
18511,"2016m5","I'll come back to how that's changed in the year in a minute, but first, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes on some of the other drivers of value growth.",760
18511,"2016m5","GBP 95 million came from a net increase in the multiples we used to value the portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","The 2 biggest contributions came from Action and Basic-Fit.",760
18511,"2016m5","We've increased Action's multiple by 0.",760
18511,"2016m5","5 turn to 14x.",760
18511,"2016m5","That increase in the multiple reflects continuing strength in its performance and its outlook for growth.",760
18511,"2016m5","We also increased the multiple used to value Basic-Fit.",760
18511,"2016m5","You would have seen Tuesday's announcement of its intention to float, which means I can't give you the actual multiple today.",760
18511,"2016m5","But if you exclude Basic-Fit and Action from the average, then the increase in average multiples is just less than 1% prediscount.",760
18511,"2016m5","There have been reports of further delays in the opening of the fixed link that will compete with Scandlines.",760
18511,"2016m5","We have not reflected possible delays to the full extent that we could have.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we delayed our opening assumption by 3 years.",760
18511,"2016m5","So the DCF value has increased, and the biggest -- is the biggest factor in the GBP 124 million that you can see here.",760
18511,"2016m5","We announced the sales of Amor and Mayborn in April.",760
18511,"2016m5","Both transactions should be complete by the end of June.",760
18511,"2016m5","They have 2 investments valued on an eminent sales basis.",760
18511,"2016m5","Coming back then to earnings growth in the portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","Overall, the portfolio continues to perform well, and our monthly portfolio monitoring helps us tackle any issues potentially arising, as they are bound to do in these tricky conditions.",760
18511,"2016m5","Value-weighted earnings growth over the last 12 months was 17%, including the significant contribution from Action, which is obviously the majority of the far right bar here.",760
18511,"2016m5","Excluding Action's contribution, growth is still a healthy 7%, but it's come down during the course of the year and was 12% in Q3.",760
18511,"2016m5","There are a few factors that explain the reduction.",760
18511,"2016m5","The sale of Element plays a part.",760
18511,"2016m5","The measure also reflects the performance of the likes of AES, Dynatect, Etanco and JMJ that Simon has talked about.",760
18511,"2016m5","We expect the macro environment to remain challenging and volatile, but barring unexpected events, it looks as though 7% should be the low point for a portfolio well positioned in chosen sectors and markets with good momentum.",760
18511,"2016m5","As you can see here, we're expecting a positive trend in the majority of our top 20 investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","[indiscernible] performance flows through the recognition of our carry.",760
18511,"2016m5","We reached an important milestone at the 31st of March 2016.",760
18511,"2016m5","The improvements in the year from 5 [ph] performance means we have recognized carry receivable on that fund for the first time for accounting purposes.",760
18511,"2016m5","Eurofund V was valued at 0.",760
18511,"2016m5","6x in 2009.",760
18511,"2016m5","At the 31st of March 2016, its multiple at now 1.",760
18511,"2016m5","Consistent with how we recognize carry payable, the receivable is calculated as if we sold all the assets at the 31st of March 2016 valuations.",760
18511,"2016m5","This is the biggest component of the GBP 58 million receivable you see here.",760
18511,"2016m5","On the payables side, most of the schemes are now through their respective performance hurdles from an accounting perspective.",760
18511,"2016m5","We generally accrue at between 10% and 15% of gross investment return on those schemes, and we recognized a charge of GBP 171 million.",760
18511,"2016m5","Private Equity returns are usually in capital form.",760
18511,"2016m5","The business made a good contribution to income, all the more so as the contribution from fee income will continue to pull as we sell investments held in third-party funds.",760
18511,"2016m5","In total, we generated GBP 50 million of income, including GBP 30 million of dividends and interest from the portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","We also expect infrastructure to provide a significant contribution to our operating cash income, and it's continued to do so in this year.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our 34% investment in 3iN delivered a GBP 33 million increase in value as our share price was resilient in the face of volatile equity markets.",760
18511,"2016m5","We received an ordinary dividends of GBP 21 million, in addition to the GBP 51 million special dividend, which is included on our realization proceeds.",760
18511,"2016m5","We also recognized a performance fee of GBP 20 million based on 3iN's NAV, which reflects another year of strong performance.",760
18511,"2016m5","As Simon said, Debt Management had a good year of fundraising.",760
18511,"2016m5","We launched 2 CLOs in Europe and 2 in the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","as well as the new global income fund.",760
18511,"2016m5","And that's a positive step in debt management diversification.",760
18511,"2016m5","As a result, we had GBP 11.",760
18511,"2016m5","6 billion of assets under management at the end of the year, supporting fee income of GBP 38 million.",760
18511,"2016m5","For regulatory reasons, we are required to invest in each new European CLO.",760
18511,"2016m5","And that is now also the practice in the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","in anticipation of equivalent U.",760
18511,"2016m5","rules, which will be effective at the end of 2016.",760
18511,"2016m5","We may also invest more than risk required to secure a flat fund launch in more volatile markets.",760
18511,"2016m5","Altogether, our CLO equity investment increased to  GBP 151 million.",760
18511,"2016m5","We took a reduction in value against those CLO investments of GBP 43 million, which mostly relates to GBP 31 million of cash distributions included in portfolio income.",760
18511,"2016m5","But a proportion did reflect negative invest sentiment more generally.",760
18511,"2016m5","That originated in the U.",760
18511,"2016m5",", where exposure to the oil and gas sector is more significant, although there was some contagion effect in Europe, too.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our teams managed the underlying credit portfolios very actively, which, in some cases, might include taking early losses in volatile markets, if appropriate.",760
18511,"2016m5","However, actual defaults are low, and our longer-term view of investment return remains positive.",760
18511,"2016m5","Debt Management, together with Private Equity and infrastructure, contributed to further progress on our cash operating profit metric.",760
18511,"2016m5","We generated a profit of GBP 37 million in the year.",760
18511,"2016m5","I've talked about the components of the GBP 117 million of cash income as we've gone through the business lines.",760
18511,"2016m5","Operating costs were GBP 134 million, which includes GBP 5 million of restructuring costs relating to planned reductions in our Nordic team, while we look to increase the size of our investment teams in our key geographies in Europe and the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","We have also recruited to support origination and business development and to address the increasing burden of regulation.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we continue to tightly manage costs, which we kept at 1% of AUM.",760
18511,"2016m5","The financial strength of our operating platform is a key difference between the 3i of today and the 3i of 2008 and 2009.",760
18511,"2016m5","And that financial strength is a significant factor in our ability to stay resilient and keep performing in challenging markets.",760
18511,"2016m5","The strength of our balance sheet is another crucial difference and advantage.",760
18511,"2016m5","We closed the year with net cash of GBP 165 million and total liquidity of  GBP 1.",760
18511,"2016m5","35 billion.",760
18511,"2016m5","We will pay our 2017 bond after cash resources.",760
18511,"2016m5","We will also be supporting 3iN's fund raising, and we plan to invest EUR 500 million to EUR 750 million in new private equity deals.",760
18511,"2016m5","Despite this planned investment, we expect to be net divestors over the next 5 years.",760
18511,"2016m5","That's partly from continuing to reshape the portfolio, but more fundamentally, it's the result as we invest in opportunities that are capable of delivering 2x our money.",760
18511,"2016m5","So with that in mind, we recommended a 10% increase in the total dividend to the year of 22p and a final dividend of 16p.",760
18511,"2016m5","That 22p is 27% of cash realizations, somewhat ahead of a 15% to 20% guidance that we set up in 2012.",760
18511,"2016m5","At that time, we believed it was important to give our shareholders a direct share in the success of the business.",760
18511,"2016m5","So we set a formula to give investors confidence that we would make that a meaningful share.",760
18511,"2016m5","We've actually paid above the upper end of the range every year the policy has been in operation.",760
18511,"2016m5","With the strength of our balance sheet outlook, we have now updated our policy.",760
18511,"2016m5","We are doubling our base dividend to 16p, and we expect to pay half at the interim dividend and the remaining half in the final.",760
18511,"2016m5","We will then pay an additional final dividend that is not limited by the 15% to 20% formula.",760
18511,"2016m5","That final dividend will depend on the level and outlook of investments, realizations and our balance sheet.",760
18511,"2016m5","That additional dividend will still be subject to gross debt being less than GBP 1 billion and group gaining [ph] less than 20%.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we don't believe that, that is likely to be a constraint.",760
18511,"2016m5","So 2016 has been an excellent year for 3i.",760
18511,"2016m5","These financial results provide further evidence of our resilience and the value of our clear, consistent strategy and disciplined approach to investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","Thank you, and we're now happy to take questions.",760
18511,"2016m5","Giving a bit more commentary about the 7% [ph] earnings growth, barring unexpected events, as you'd expect me to say, that should be a low point.",760
18511,"2016m5","A lot of this is about the mix that's in that measure.",760
18511,"2016m5","So obviously, the sale of Element, which is one of our largest assets, with 20% growth, has come out of it.",760
18511,"2016m5","In terms of our new investments, we've got some positive investment cases there, but it's relatively early days for them to really be featuring in the calculation.",760
18511,"2016m5","And I think if you look at those companies that Simon's talked about, the AESs, Dynatects, Etancos of this world, where they have been subject to the headwinds, we're starting to see some more positive outlook for those businesses.",760
18511,"2016m5","And they are part of that change in the metric from 5 companies on the forecast earnings to 2 at this period.",760
18511,"2016m5","So yes, barring anything unexpected happening, we should see that sort of stabilizing and coming out from that measure.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we've recognized we are operating in fairly tricky times.",760
18511,"2016m5","And the slide 29, which I think is the bar chart that shows you the breakup of the earnings growth, what you've really got in that shift, I think, is GBP 373 million in the minus 1% to minus 10% bar.",760
18511,"2016m5","And what you've got in the components of that are the companies that we just talked about.",760
18511,"2016m5","So they would sort of in the bar to the right previously, and they shifted over to that.",760
18511,"2016m5","That's a historic chart.",760
18511,"2016m5","So it's consistent with what we've just been talking, talked about.",760
18511,"2016m5","Good morning, everyone.",760
18511,"2016m5","Welcome to 3i's final results for the year through the 31st of March 2016.",760
18511,"2016m5","Since we last spoke, we've had another very productive 6 months.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we closed this year with strong returns across the group, giving us excellent momentum as we moved into the new financial year.",760
18511,"2016m5","We've made very good progress against our key KPIs.",760
18511,"2016m5","We closed the year with a 22% total return on equity, net cash of  GBP 165 million and an increased dividend of 22p for the year.",760
18511,"2016m5","NAV has increased by 17% to 463p.",760
18511,"2016m5","And group operating cash profit has increased again to GBP 37 million.",760
18511,"2016m5","All of our divisions have performed well, and the group's portfolio of investments is coping well with the various macroeconomic challenges.",760
18511,"2016m5","And the longer-term reshaping of 3i continues.",760
18511,"2016m5","We're building on the foundations of our 3-year restructuring.",760
18511,"2016m5","It's been a volatile year for the markets, but we have made further good progress.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we enter FY '17 with a more focused portfolio of high-quality investments, good cost and investment discipline and a solid balance sheet.",760
18511,"2016m5","And going forward, we remain focused on executing our well-established strategy and maintaining a disciplined approach to new investment.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our international platform and sector experience, combined with our proprietary capital approach, gives us important competitive advantages in the mid-market where we compete.",760
18511,"2016m5","There's no question that both the macro and geopolitical environment has become a lot more challenging.",760
18511,"2016m5","And it's clear that headwinds have reduced growth in many sectors and geographies over the last 12 months.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we remain confident of achieving returns in excess of 2x by sticking to the mid-market and by maintaining the rigor of our investment assessments and active management approach.",760
18511,"2016m5","But in the investment world, it's not just macro headwinds that are the problem today.",760
18511,"2016m5","You've also got to contend with the sheer amount of money looking for a home.",760
18511,"2016m5","Even though M&A activity and growth in the last year or 2 has been up and down, fundraising has stayed at historically high levels.",760
18511,"2016m5","And today, we now have record amounts of dry powder across the Private Equity sector.",760
18511,"2016m5","The vast majority of the dry powder is in the mega funds, many of which we avoid while focused on the mid-market.",760
18511,"2016m5","So we've got to maintain our discipline on new investments and be energetic and creative in looking for opportunities in those sectors and geographies we know well.",760
18511,"2016m5","In line with that approach, we have decided to optimize our team resources by reducing our investment team for Scandinavia, and at the same time, we're increasing our resources in the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","and Germany.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our Private Equity team has had another busy year.",760
18511,"2016m5","They delivered a 32% return on the year, another good level of realizations as well as making 3 interesting new investments, having looked at many more.",760
18511,"2016m5","We started FY '16 selling or listing many of our older or smaller investments, and that led to a further rationalization in the size of our portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","But the divestment environment became a lot more challenging in the second half, where our activity was fortunately more focused on some of our bigger and stronger assets.",760
18511,"2016m5","The Element sale process coped well with the deteriorating circumstances, as did the Action refinancing.",760
18511,"2016m5","But our Mayborn exit was not helped by weaker debt markets and a flatter profit profile for that business.",760
18511,"2016m5","But in the end, we were pleased with the terms for Mayborn when we finally announced the sale of 3.",760
18511,"2016m5","5x money multiple in April this year.",760
18511,"2016m5","Earnings growth has remained strong across our Private Equity portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our larger bucket 1 investments have made a big contribution to the growth.",760
18511,"2016m5","And well we have avoided direct exposure to oil or commodities or to many emerging markets, we have nonetheless suffered from oil-related issues with JMJ, Dynatect and AES, and Julia will give you more detail on that shortly.",760
18511,"2016m5","In the case of JMJ, our safety consultancy business, 65% of revenues are from the oil and gas sector.",760
18511,"2016m5","And so that trading has been hit hard by the reductions in capital expenditure plans.",760
18511,"2016m5","As a result, we're working closely with management to take costs out of the business and to diversify into new sectors such as aerospace.",760
18511,"2016m5","The Russian economy and the reduced spending power of Russian consumers has had a negative impact on trading of Action Provocateurs.",760
18511,"2016m5","And Etanco, our roofing system business, continues to suffer from low levels of construction activity in France.",760
18511,"2016m5","At the other end of the spectrum, we have the mighty Action.",760
18511,"2016m5","Action delivered another year of 30%-plus sales growth, a company by strong like-for-likes and excellent EBITDA and cash flow growth.",760
18511,"2016m5","The significant store opening program continued, with 144 new openings last year.",760
18511,"2016m5","Action has even more openings planned for this year, with expansion into 2 deep markets of France and Germany going particularly well.",760
18511,"2016m5","But the crucial thing for Action last year was the selection of a new CFO and a new CEO.",760
18511,"2016m5","Management is always a critical element in our Private Equity investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","And Frederik Lotz and Xander Ventolan [ph], I am confident, we've got 2 very capable executives, who will take action onto even better performance.",760
18511,"2016m5","And I hope many of you will come to our Investor Day on the 8th of June.",760
18511,"2016m5","You can meet Frederick and Xander and form your own view.",760
18511,"2016m5","FY '16 was another year to be highly disciplined when reviewing your investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","And having had a very full whip [ph] to consider, we narrowed our investments down to just 3 quality acquisitions in Euro-Diesel, Weener Plastic and Audley Travel.",760
18511,"2016m5","In each case, we have to persevere with the process where the early running was inevitably made by others who were unable to maintain their early leadership based on aggressive valuations.",760
18511,"2016m5","We're satisfied that in all 3 cases, we have bought promising businesses at fair prices, with realistic plans to achieve our 2x hurdle.",760
18511,"2016m5","And in the case of Audley Travel, we were able to use our strong balance sheet to underwrite the debt and truncate the sale process to our advantage.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our Private Equity portfolio continues to evolve and is now even more dominated by those investments where we feel confident of making our 2x return or better.",760
18511,"2016m5","It is also more manageable since we reduced our overall number of investments down to 47 companies by the end of March.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we are planning to streamline it further during the current year.",760
18511,"2016m5","We're confident in the portfolio we have put together over the last few years, and we believe our thorough research and price discipline will be well-rewarded.",760
18511,"2016m5","Quality Private Equity portfolios have a certain shape to them, 1 or 2 stars and lots of solid returns around 2x or better, with no or very few material losses.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our current portfolio, with no -- is beginning to look more like that.",760
18511,"2016m5","CVC have their racing cars, and Electra have their caravans.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we have our action stores as well as a good group of other companies capable of returning better than 2x.",760
18511,"2016m5","You'll see the results on Element, Mayborn and Amor recently.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we have plenty of other strong performers, including Basic-Fit, Scandlines and ATESTEO, which I haven't talked about today.",760
18511,"2016m5","And importantly, in recent years, we've managed to avoid the material investment misjudgments, which have plagued 3i in the past.",760
18511,"2016m5","Now I don't need to sound complacent 
[Audio Gap] 
and about some of the misguided regulation we face.",760
18511,"2016m5","But I do feel that through our stronger processes and experience, we're a little more in control of the things that matter to our performance.",760
18511,"2016m5","Now I'd like to turn to Infrastructure where we've engineered a mini revolution in the pace of activity at 3iN.",760
18511,"2016m5","We've changed the management of our infrastructure team, and we agreed on a change in financial return and investment mandate for 3iN.",760
18511,"2016m5","At the same time, we overhauled and added to the origination capability in our infrastructure team.",760
18511,"2016m5","We're now seeing the fruits of those changes.",760
18511,"2016m5","We're benefiting from a stronger origination performance, combined with steady asset management, which has been the hallmark of 3iN's past.",760
18511,"2016m5","As a result, 3iN has had a more all-round year of performance.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we they putting together a very interesting collection of midsized core infrastructure assets, which are aligned to the group's midsized focus and operational experience.",760
18511,"2016m5","The infrastructure sector is arguably suffering from even more acute dry powder issues in private equity.",760
18511,"2016m5","That's why the importance of our changing focus cannot be understated.",760
18511,"2016m5","The new approach should underpin the growth in returns of 3iN going forward, and as a result, the 3i Group intends to support the placing announced by 3iN on the 12th of May last week.",760
18511,"2016m5","Debt Management faced some very challenging market conditions in FY '16, but they performed well both financially and in protecting the creditworthiness of their portfolios.",760
18511,"2016m5","The team raised GBP 1.",760
18511,"2016m5","3 billion of new CLO AUM before those markets closed in January.",760
18511,"2016m5","And they made a strong cash contribution to the group's operating cash income.",760
18511,"2016m5","Importantly, the underlying credit performance of our CLO investments in the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","and Europe remains sound, and confidence in the CLA market is recovering.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our effectiveness at generating stronger returns and passing cash back to shareholders has taken another good step forward this year.",760
18511,"2016m5","And that underpins our confidence in increasing this year's dividend and in enhancing the dividend policy going forward.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our future performance will be determined by the consistency of our investment and asset management processes and by the quality of the investment portfolios we have put together.",760
18511,"2016m5","And while we can't be immune to the macro and political volatility that we see everywhere we look, we remain confident of our ability to produce at least 2x returns from a good level of realizations.",760
18511,"2016m5","If we continue to hit that target, we should deliver mid- to high teens net returns to our shareholders.",760
18511,"2016m5","And in years like this one, with some excellent realizations, shareholders can expect to see 20% plus returns.",760
18511,"2016m5","Now I'll pass over to Julia.",760
18511,"2016m5","Philip? It has been heavily impacted by a couple of changes of the bigger investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","It's not a general move up.",760
18511,"2016m5","Anyone else? No [indiscernible]? No action? Okay.",760
18511,"2016m5","Well, thanks for coming, everyone.",760
18511,"2016m5","And have a good day.",760
18511,"2016m5","They feature in our portfolio monitoring meetings, and there are some signs of stability coming up back in to those businesses.",760
18511,"2016m5","We've seen in the industrial sector generally having a bit more of a positive outlook and maybe it looked quite gloomy at the end of last year and coming into an early this year.",760
18511,"2016m5","I just wondered if could you say a little bit about your plans for new investment because I understand the point about selective and focus on your core competencies.",760
18511,"2016m5","How much new investment are you targeting this year? How do you think the outlook is looking now compared to a year ago? How much you think you are hiring in the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","and Germany will facilitate that? And more generally, what do you think it's kind of the right level of investment you need to remain relevant and to recycle your capital? It's Iain Scouller from Stifel.",760
18511,"2016m5","Just on the multiple that's been used really the portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","I mean, it looks as though that might be reaching a peak.",760
18511,"2016m5","Can you give us an idea on sensitivity? I mean, if the multiple was full by 10% from about 10x to 9x, what sort of imply that will have on the return? Not very easily is the answer because it's such a mix of the different -- 2 different businesses.",760
18511,"2016m5","So we don't normally think about that like that.",760
18511,"2016m5","As I said, you've got 2 big components and that clearly it's the multiple that we use value action at 14x.",760
18511,"2016m5","I can't give you the multiple that we've used to value Basic-Fit, but it's obviously relative to the announcement that we made on Tuesday.",760
18511,"2016m5","I mean, the spread of the multiples that we used is about 5.",760
18511,"2016m5","But I tend to concentrate around the average more normally.",760
18511,"2016m5","Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",760
18511,"2016m5","A couple of questions for me.",760
18511,"2016m5","I wondered if you could provide any color around your comments on the 7% earnings growth ex Action as the confidence of that's sort of being a trough.",760
18511,"2016m5","Is that due to the timing of new investments coming online? Is there anything you can point to in terms of, I guess, proportion of forecast accounts that gives that confidence? Second question, I had a question on Slide 29 where you detailed the earnings momentum in those buckets.",760
18511,"2016m5","The 5 assets that you outlined as sort of more problematic, you've come to them before.",760
18511,"2016m5","That seemed to be about GBP 270 million of value, but it's about GBP 470 million there with negative earnings momentum.",760
18511,"2016m5","So any more color on what else is in there outside of those 5 assets? You've indicated reasons more optimism in those 5 assets? Well, I think we indicated in Julia's presentation that we're looking to invest GBP 500 million to EUR 700 million this year.",760
18511,"2016m5","And I think that is the type of level that we think is the right level, given the current market conditions and the scale of the mid-market in particular.",760
18511,"2016m5","We have probably the broadest platform in the mid-market amongst any of our competitors with the office network we have.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we are seeing more opportunities and more flow in Germany and the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","in particular.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we would like to resource up those teams.",760
18511,"2016m5","But because of the dry powder, there are times when we get quite far down of process, but there is simply a gap either between us and another bidder or between us and the vendor.",760
18511,"2016m5","And what we're not going to do is pay too much for something.",760
18511,"2016m5","So there will be year is as we seen in the last few years, where we will struggle to put that amount of money to work.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we'll buy good quality assets at a lower amount.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we think that having more resource, we stand a better chance of hitting the GBP 500 million to GBP 700 million without going up in price too much.",760
18511,"2016m5","Iain? Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",760
18511,"2016m5","A couple of questions for me.",760
18511,"2016m5","I wondered if you could provide any more color around your comments to the, the 7% earnings growth ex Action as the confidence of that's sort of being a trough.",760
18511,"2016m5","Is that due to the timing of new investments coming online? Is there anything you can point to in terms of, I guess, proportion of forecast accounts that gives that confidence? Second question, I had a question on Slide 29 where you detailed with the earnings momentum in those buckets.",760
18511,"2016m5","The 5 assets that you outlined as sort of more problematic, you've commented on them before.",760
18511,"2016m5","That seemed to be about GBP 270 million of value, but there's about GBP 470 million there with negative earnings momentum.",760
18511,"2016m5","So any more color on what else is in there outside of those 5 assets? Philip? But you indicated you are seeing a bit of reasons for more optimism in those 5 assets? Not very easily is the answer because it's such a mix of the different -- 2 different businesses.",760
18511,"2016m5","So we don't normally think about it like that.",760
18511,"2016m5","As I said, that you've got 2 big components in there, that clearly is the multiple that we use value action at 14x.",760
18511,"2016m5","I can't give you the multiple that we've used to value Basic-Fit, but it's obviously relative to the announcement that we made on Tuesday.",760
18511,"2016m5","I mean, the spread of the multiples that we use is about 5.",760
18511,"2016m5","But I tend to concentrate around the average more normally.",760
18511,"2016m5","Daniel? Yes.",760
18511,"2016m5","They feature in our portfolio monitoring meetings, and there are some signs of stability coming up back into those businesses.",760
18511,"2016m5","We've seen in the industrial sector generally having a bit more of a positive outlook then maybe -- it looked quite gloomy at the end of last year and coming into early this year.",760
18511,"2016m5","Good morning, everyone.",760
18511,"2016m5","Welcome to 3i's final results for the year through the 31st of March 2016.",760
18511,"2016m5","Since we last spoke, we've had another very productive 6 months, and we closed this year with strong returns across the group, giving us excellent momentum as we move into the new financial year.",760
18511,"2016m5","We've made very good progress against our key KPIs.",760
18511,"2016m5","We closed the year with a 22% total return on equity, net cash of  GBP 165 million and an increased dividend of 22p for the year.",760
18511,"2016m5","NAV has increased by 17% to 463p.",760
18511,"2016m5","And group operating cash profit has increased again to GBP 37 million.",760
18511,"2016m5","All of our divisions have performed well, and the group's portfolio of investments is coping well with the various macroeconomic challenges.",760
18511,"2016m5","And the longer-term reshaping of 3i continues.",760
18511,"2016m5","We're building on the foundations of our 3-year restructuring.",760
18511,"2016m5","It's been a volatile year for the markets, but we have made further good progress.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we enter FY '17 with a more focused portfolio of high-quality investments, good cost and investment discipline and a solid balance sheet.",760
18511,"2016m5","And going forward, we remain focused on executing our well-established strategy and maintaining a disciplined approach to new investment.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our international platform and sector experience, combined with our proprietary capital approach, gives us important competitive advantages in the mid-market where we compete.",760
18511,"2016m5","There's no question that both the macro and geopolitical environment has become a lot more challenging, and it's clear that headwinds have reduced growth in many sectors and geographies over the last 12 months.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we remain confident of achieving returns in excess of 2x by sticking to the mid-market and by maintaining the rigor of our investment assessments and active management approach.",760
18511,"2016m5","But in the investment world, it's not just macro headwinds that are the problem today.",760
18511,"2016m5","You've also got to contend with the sheer amount of money looking for a home.",760
18511,"2016m5","Even though M&A activity and growth in the last year or 2 has been up and down, fundraising has stayed at historically high levels.",760
18511,"2016m5","And today, we now have record amounts of dry powder across the Private Equity sector.",760
18511,"2016m5","The vast majority of the dry powder is in the mega funds, many of which we avoid while focused on the mid-market.",760
18511,"2016m5","So we've got to maintain our discipline on new investments and be energetic and creative in looking for opportunities in those sectors and geographies we know well.",760
18511,"2016m5","In line with that approach, we've decided to optimize our team resources by reducing our investment team for Scandinavia.",760
18511,"2016m5","And at the same time, we're increasing our resources in the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","and Germany.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our Private Equity team has had another busy year.",760
18511,"2016m5","They delivered a 32% return on the year, another good level of realizations as well as making 3 interesting new investments, having looked at many more.",760
18511,"2016m5","We started FY '16 selling or listing many of our older or smaller investments, and that led to a further rationalization in the size of our portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","But the divestment environment became a lot more challenging in the second half, where our activity was fortunately more focused on some of our bigger and stronger assets.",760
18511,"2016m5","The Element sale process coped well with the deteriorating circumstances as did the Action refinancing.",760
18511,"2016m5","But our Mayborn exit was not helped by weaker debt markets and a flatter profit profile for that business.",760
18511,"2016m5","But in the end, we were pleased with the terms for Mayborn, when we finally announced the sale of 3.",760
18511,"2016m5","5x money multiple in April this year.",760
18511,"2016m5","Earnings growth has remained strong across our Private Equity portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our larger bucket one investments have made a big contribution to the growth.",760
18511,"2016m5","And while we have avoided direct exposure to oil or commodities or to many emerging markets, we have nonetheless suffered from oil-related issues with JMJ, Dynatect and AES, and Julia will give you more detail on that shortly.",760
18511,"2016m5","In the case of JMJ, our safety consultancy business, 65% of revenues are from the oil and gas sector.",760
18511,"2016m5","And so that trading has been hit hard by the reductions in capital expenditure plans.",760
18511,"2016m5","As a result, we're working closely with management to take costs out of the business and to diversify into new sectors such as aerospace.",760
18511,"2016m5","The Russian economy and the reduced spending power of Russian consumers has had a negative impact on trading of Agent Provocateur.",760
18511,"2016m5","And Etanco, our roofing system business, continues to suffer from low levels of construction activity in France.",760
18511,"2016m5","At the other end of the spectrum, we have the mighty Action.",760
18511,"2016m5","Action delivered another year of 30%-plus sales growth accompanied by strong like-for-likes and excellent EBITDA and cash flow growth.",760
18511,"2016m5","The significant store opening program continued with 144 new openings last year.",760
18511,"2016m5","Action has even more openings planned for this year, with expansion into 2 deep markets of France and Germany going particularly well.",760
18511,"2016m5","But the crucial thing for Action last year was the selection of a new CFO and a new CEO.",760
18511,"2016m5","Management is always a critical element in our Private Equity investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","And Frederik Lotz and Sander van der Laan, I am confident we've got 2 very capable executives, who will take Action on to even better performance.",760
18511,"2016m5","And I hope many of you will come to our Investor Day on the 8th of June.",760
18511,"2016m5","You can meet Frederik and Sander and form your own view.",760
18511,"2016m5","FY '16 was another year to be highly disciplined when reviewing new investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","And having had a very full whip [ph] to consider, we narrowed our investments down to just 3 quality acquisitions in Euro-Diesel, Weener Plastic and Audley Travel.",760
18511,"2016m5","In each case, we have to persevere with the process where the early running was inevitably made by others who were unable to maintain their early leadership based on aggressive valuations.",760
18511,"2016m5","We're satisfied that in all 3 cases, we have bought promising businesses at fair prices with realistic plans to achieve our 2x hurdle.",760
18511,"2016m5","And in the case of Audley Travel, we were able to use our strong balance sheet to underwrite the debt and truncate the sale process to our advantage.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our Private Equity portfolio continues to evolve and is now even more dominated by those investments where we feel confident of making our 2x return or better.",760
18511,"2016m5","It is also more manageable since we reduced our overall number of investments down to 47 companies by the end of March.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we are planning to streamline it further during the current year.",760
18511,"2016m5","We're confident in the portfolio we have put together over the last few years, and we believe our thorough research and price discipline will be well rewarded.",760
18511,"2016m5","Quality Private Equity portfolios have a certain shape to them, 1 or 2 stars and lots of solid returns, around 2x or better, with no or very few material losses.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our current portfolio with no -- is beginning to look more like that.",760
18511,"2016m5","CVC have their racing cars, and Electra have their caravans.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we have our Action stores as well as a good group of other companies capable of returning better than 2x.",760
18511,"2016m5","You've seen the results on Element, Mayborn and Amor recently.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we have plenty of other strong performers, including Basic-Fit, Scandlines and ATESTEO, which I haven't talked about today.",760
18511,"2016m5","And importantly, in recent years, we've managed to avoid the material investment misjudgments, which have plagued 3i in the past.",760
18511,"2016m5","Now I don't mean to sound complacent
[Audio Gap] 
and about some of the misguided regulation we face.",760
18511,"2016m5","But I do feel that through our stronger processes and experience, we're a little more in control of the things that matter to our performance.",760
18511,"2016m5","Now I'd like to turn to Infrastructure, where we've engineered a mini-revolution in the pace of activity at 3iN.",760
18511,"2016m5","We've changed the management of our Infrastructure team, and we agreed on a change in financial return and investment mandate for 3iN.",760
18511,"2016m5","At the same time, we overhauled and added to the origination capability in our Infrastructure team.",760
18511,"2016m5","We're now seeing the fruits of those changes.",760
18511,"2016m5","We're benefiting from a stronger origination performance combined with steady asset management, which has been the hallmark of 3iN's past.",760
18511,"2016m5","As a result, 3iN has had a more all-round year of performance.",760
18511,"2016m5","And they're putting together a very interesting collection of midsized core Infrastructure assets, which are aligned to the group's midsized focus and operational experience.",760
18511,"2016m5","The Infrastructure sector is arguably suffering from even more acute dry powder issues than Private Equity.",760
18511,"2016m5","That's why the importance of our changing focus cannot be understated.",760
18511,"2016m5","The new approach should underpin the growth in returns of 3iN going forward.",760
18511,"2016m5","And as a result, the 3i Group intends to support the placing announced by 3iN on the 12th of May last week.",760
18511,"2016m5","Debt Management faced some very challenging market conditions in FY '16, but they performed well, both financially and in protecting the creditworthiness of their portfolios.",760
18511,"2016m5","The team raised GBP 1.",760
18511,"2016m5","3 billion of new CLO AUM before those markets closed in January, and they made a strong cash contribution to the group's operating cash income.",760
18511,"2016m5","Importantly, the underlying credit performance of our CLO investments in the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","and Europe remains sound and confidence in the CLA market is recovering.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our effectiveness at generating stronger returns and passing cash back to shareholders has taken another good step forward this year, and that underpins our confidence in increasing this year's dividend and in enhancing the dividend policy going forward.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our future performance will be determined by the consistency of our investment and asset management processes and by the quality of the investment portfolio we have put together.",760
18511,"2016m5","And while we can't be immune to the macro and political volatility that we see everywhere we look, we remain confident of our ability to produce at least 2x returns from a good level of realizations.",760
18511,"2016m5","If we continue to hit that target, we should deliver mid- to high-teens net returns to our shareholders.",760
18511,"2016m5","And in years like this one, with some excellent realizations, shareholders can expect to see 20%-plus returns.",760
18511,"2016m5","Now I'll pass over to Julia.",760
18511,"2016m5","I just wonder if could you say a little bit about your plans for new investment, because I understand your point about want us to be selective and focus on your core competencies.",760
18511,"2016m5","How much new investment are you targeting this year? How do you think the outlook is looking now compared to a year ago? How much do you think your hiring in the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","and Germany will facilitate that? And more generally, what do you think is kind of the right level of investment you need to remain relevant and to recycle your capital? Coming to a bit more commentary about the 7% earnings growth, unless there -- barring unexpected events, as you'd expect me to say, that should be a low point.",760
18511,"2016m5","And a lot of this is about the mix that's in that measure.",760
18511,"2016m5","So obviously, the sale of Element, which is one of our largest assets, with 20% growth, has come out of it.",760
18511,"2016m5","In terms of our new investments, we've got some positive investment cases there, but it's relatively early days for them to really be featuring in the calculation.",760
18511,"2016m5","And I think if you look at those companies that Simon's talked about, the AESs, Dynatects, Etancos of this world, where they have been subject to the headwinds, we're starting to see some more positive outlook for those businesses.",760
18511,"2016m5","And they are part of that change in the metric from 5 companies on the forecast earnings to 2 at this period.",760
18511,"2016m5","So yes, barring anything unexpected happening, we should see that sort of stabilizing and coming out from that measure.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we've recognized that we are operating in fairly tricky times.",760
18511,"2016m5","In the slide 29, which I think is the bar chart that shows you the breakup of the earnings growth, what you've really got in that shift, I think, is GBP 373 million in the minus 1% to minus 10% bar.",760
18511,"2016m5","And what you've got in the components of that are the companies that we've just talked about.",760
18511,"2016m5","So they would sort of in the bar to the right previously, and they shifted over to that.",760
18511,"2016m5","That's a historic chart.",760
18511,"2016m5","So it's consistent with what we've just been talking about.",760
18511,"2016m5","Thank you, Simon.",760
18511,"2016m5","As you just heard, this has been an excellent year for 3i.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our financial performance provides evidence of the resilience of our operating and business model even against a background of volatility and uncertainty in those markets that Simon has talked about.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we continue to execute our well-defined strategy.",760
18511,"2016m5","We closed the year with very strong performance in the final quarter.",760
18511,"2016m5","We delivered NAV per share of 463p and a 21.",760
18511,"2016m5","7% return on our opening net assets.",760
18511,"2016m5","The main drivers of NAV growth contributing 77p was solid portfolio performance and successful realizations.",760
18511,"2016m5","That performance is also reflected in the increase in net carry payables with an 11p impact.",760
18511,"2016m5","We benefited from Sterling's weakness, which gave us a net 16p translation gain in the year.",760
18511,"2016m5","And finally, we paid total dividends of 20p in the year.",760
18511,"2016m5","Now I know some of you like the bridge for the quarter 2, so that's in the back of the pack.",760
18511,"2016m5","The Private Equity business had a very good year.",760
18511,"2016m5","They generated gross investment return of over GBP 1 billion or 32% of opening portfolio value.",760
18511,"2016m5","And that's an excellent performance, especially in these tricky market conditions.",760
18511,"2016m5","P/E realizations of GBP 743 million include 11 smaller and older assets and GBP 179 million from the sale of Element.",760
18511,"2016m5","It was one of our largest assets, and the sale was at a money multiple of 3.",760
18511,"2016m5","The uplift of 14% is lower than last year, and that just reflects the fact that GBP 111 million of the proceeds were from sales of our quoted investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","And the weight of the transactions was early in the year, so most of the exit value had been reflected in the opening NAV.",760
18511,"2016m5","So we're continuing to make good progress in reshaping the portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we've put a slide in the back of the pack to give you full details of all the realizations.",760
18511,"2016m5","Now although the total number of investments reduced, the Private Equity portfolio value increased to GBP 3.",760
18511,"2016m5","7 billion, supported by a number of material value increases in our largest assets.",760
18511,"2016m5","On a really positive note, the GBP 690 million of unrealized value growth is underpinned by the performance of the portfolio, that is earnings growth and changes in net debt.",760
18511,"2016m5","The performance of assets valued on an earnings basis accounted for GBP 460 million of the uplift, and they had value weighted average earnings growth of 17%.",760
18511,"2016m5","If you exclude Action with its earnings growth of over 30%, the average is 7%.",760
18511,"2016m5","I'll come back to how that's changed in the year in a minute.",760
18511,"2016m5","But first, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes on some of the other drivers of value growth.",760
18511,"2016m5","GBP 95 million came from a net increase in the multiples we used to value the portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","The 2 biggest contributions came from Action and Basic-Fit, with increased Action's multiple by 0.",760
18511,"2016m5","5 turn to 14x.",760
18511,"2016m5","That increase in the multiple reflects continuing strength in its performance and its outlook for growth.",760
18511,"2016m5","We also increased the multiple used to value Basic-Fit.",760
18511,"2016m5","You will have seen Tuesday's announcement of its intention to float, which means I can't give you the actual multiple today.",760
18511,"2016m5","But if you exclude Basic-Fit and Action from the average, then the increase in average multiples is just less than 1% previous count.",760
18511,"2016m5","There have been reports of further delays in the opening of the fixed link that will compete with Scandlines.",760
18511,"2016m5","We have not reflected possible delays to the full extent that we could have, but we've delayed our opening assumption by 3 years.",760
18511,"2016m5","So the DCF value has increased and the biggest -- is the biggest factor in the GBP 124 million that you can see here.",760
18511,"2016m5","We announced the sales of Amor and Mayborn in April.",760
18511,"2016m5","Both transactions should be complete by the end of June.",760
18511,"2016m5","They have achieved investments valued on an imminent sales basis.",760
18511,"2016m5","Coming back then to earnings growth in the portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","Overall, the portfolio continues to perform well, and our monthly portfolio monitoring helps us tackle any issues potentially arising, as they are bound to do in these tricky conditions.",760
18511,"2016m5","Value-weighted earnings growth over the last 12 months was 17%, including the significant contribution from Action, which is obviously the majority of the far right bar here.",760
18511,"2016m5","Excluding Action's contribution, growth is still a healthy 7%, but it's come down during the course of the year and was 12% in Q3.",760
18511,"2016m5","There are a few factors that explain the reduction.",760
18511,"2016m5","The sale of Element plays a part.",760
18511,"2016m5","The measure also reflects the performance of the likes of AES, Dynatect, Etanco and JMJ that Simon has talked about.",760
18511,"2016m5","We expect the macro environment to remain challenging and volatile.",760
18511,"2016m5","But barring unexpected events, it looks as though 7% should be the low point for a portfolio well positioned in chosen sectors and markets with good momentum.",760
18511,"2016m5","As you can see here, we're expecting a positive trend in the majority of our top 20 investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","All this good performance flows through to the recognition of our carry.",760
18511,"2016m5","We reached an important milestone at the 31st of March 2016.",760
18511,"2016m5","Improvements in the year from V performance means we have recognized carry receivable on that fund for the first time for accounting purposes.",760
18511,"2016m5","Eurofund V was valued at 0.",760
18511,"2016m5","6x in 2009.",760
18511,"2016m5","At the 31st of March 2016, its multiple is now 1.",760
18511,"2016m5","Consistent with how we recognize carry payable, the receivable is calculated as if we sold all the assets at the 31st of March 2016 valuations.",760
18511,"2016m5","This is the biggest component of the GBP 58 million receivable you see here.",760
18511,"2016m5","On the payables side, most of the schemes are now through their respective performance hurdles from an accounting perspective.",760
18511,"2016m5","We generally accrue at between 10% and 15% of gross investment return on those schemes, and we recognized a charge of GBP 171 million.",760
18511,"2016m5","Private Equity returns are usually in capital form.",760
18511,"2016m5","The business made a good contribution to income, all the more so as the contribution from fee income will continue to pull as we sell investments held in third-party funds.",760
18511,"2016m5","In total, we generated GBP 50 million of income, including GBP 30 million of dividends and interest from the portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","We also expect Infrastructure to provide a significant contribution to our operating cash income, and it's continued to do so in this year.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our 34% investment in 3iN delivered a GBP 33 million increase in value, as the share price is resilient in the face of volatile equity markets.",760
18511,"2016m5","We received ordinary dividends of GBP 21 million in addition to the GBP 51 million special dividend, which is included on our realization proceeds.",760
18511,"2016m5","We also recognized a performance fee of GBP 20 million based on 3iN's NAV, which reflects another year of strong performance.",760
18511,"2016m5","As Simon said, Debt Management had a good year of fundraising.",760
18511,"2016m5","We launched 2 CLOs in Europe and 2 in the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","as well as the new global income fund.",760
18511,"2016m5","And that's a positive step in Debt Management's diversification.",760
18511,"2016m5","As a result, we had GBP 11.",760
18511,"2016m5","6 billion of assets under management at the end of the year, supporting fee income of GBP 38 million.",760
18511,"2016m5","For regulatory reasons, we are required to invest in each new European CLO, and that is now also the practice in the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","in anticipation of equivalent U.",760
18511,"2016m5","rules, which will be effective at the end of 2016.",760
18511,"2016m5","We may also invest more than risk required to secure a flat fund launch in more volatile markets.",760
18511,"2016m5","All together, our CLO equity investment increased to GBP 151 million.",760
18511,"2016m5","We took a reduction in value against those CLO investments of GBP 43 million, which mostly relates to the GBP 31 million of cash distributions included in portfolio income.",760
18511,"2016m5","But a proportion did reflect negative investor sentiment more generally.",760
18511,"2016m5","That originated in the U.",760
18511,"2016m5",", where exposure to the oil and gas sector is more significant, although there was some contagion effect in Europe too.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our teams managed the underlying credit portfolios very actively, which in some cases might include taking early losses in volatile markets if appropriate.",760
18511,"2016m5","However, actual defaults are low, and our longer-term view of investment return remains positive.",760
18511,"2016m5","Debt Management, together with Private Equity and Infrastructure, contributed to further progress on our cash operating profit metric.",760
18511,"2016m5","We generated a profit of GBP 37 million in the year.",760
18511,"2016m5","I've talked about the components of the GBP 117 million of cash income as we've gone through the business lines.",760
18511,"2016m5","Operating costs were GBP 134 million, which includes GBP 5 million of restructuring costs relating to planned reductions in our Nordic team, where we look to increase the size of our investment teams in our key geographies in Europe and the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","We have also recruited to support origination and business development and to address the increasing burden of regulation.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we continue to tightly manage costs, which we kept 1% of AUM.",760
18511,"2016m5","The financial strength of our operating platform is a key difference between the 3i of today and the 3i of 2008 and 2009.",760
18511,"2016m5","And that financial strength is a significant factor in our ability to stay resilient and keep performing in challenging markets.",760
18511,"2016m5","The strength of our balance sheet is another crucial difference and advantage.",760
18511,"2016m5","We closed the year with net cash of GBP 165 million and total liquidity of  GBP 1.",760
18511,"2016m5","35 billion.",760
18511,"2016m5","We will pay our 2017 bond after cash resources.",760
18511,"2016m5","We will also be supporting 3iN's fund raising.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we plan to invest EUR 500 million to EUR 750 million in new Private Equity deals.",760
18511,"2016m5","Despite this planned investment, we expect to be net divestors over the next 5 years.",760
18511,"2016m5","That's partly from continuing to reshape the portfolio, but more fundamentally, it's the result as we invest in opportunities that are capable of delivering 2x our money.",760
18511,"2016m5","So with that in mind, we've recommended a 10% increase in the total dividend to the year of 22p and a final dividend of 16p.",760
18511,"2016m5","That 22p is 27% of cash realizations, somewhat ahead of a 15% to 20% guidance that we set in 2012.",760
18511,"2016m5","At that time, we believed it was important to give our shareholders a direct share in the success of the business.",760
18511,"2016m5","So we set that formula to give investors confidence that we would make that a meaningful share.",760
18511,"2016m5","We've actually paid above the upper end of the range every year the policy has been in operation.",760
18511,"2016m5","With the strength of our balance sheet outlook, we have now updated our policy.",760
18511,"2016m5","We are doubling our base dividend to 16p, and we expect to pay half at the interim dividend and the remaining half in the final.",760
18511,"2016m5","We will then pay an additional final dividend that 20% limited 20% that is not limited by the 15% to 20% formula.",760
18511,"2016m5","That final will depend on the level and outlook of investments, realizations and our balance sheet.",760
18511,"2016m5","That additional dividend will still be subject to gross debt being less than GBP 1 billion and group gearing less than 20%.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we don't believe that, that is likely to be a constraint.",760
18511,"2016m5","So 2016 has been an excellent year for 3i.",760
18511,"2016m5","These financial results provide further evidence of our resilience and the value of our clear, consistent strategy and disciplined approach to investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","Thank you, and we're now happy to take questions.",760
18511,"2016m5","It has been heavily impacted by a couple of changes of the bigger investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","It's not a general move up.",760
18511,"2016m5","Anyone else? No break serve? No action? Okay.",760
18511,"2016m5","Well, thanks for coming, everyone.",760
18511,"2016m5","And have a good day.",760
18511,"2016m5","Well, I think we indicated in Julia's presentation that we're looking to invest GBP 500 million to EUR 700 million this year.",760
18511,"2016m5","And I think that is the type of level that we think is the right level, given the current market conditions and the scale of the mid-market in particular.",760
18511,"2016m5","We have probably the broadest platform in the mid-market amongst any of our competitors with the office network we have.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we are seeing more opportunities and more flow in Germany and the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","in particular.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we would like to resource up those teams.",760
18511,"2016m5","But because of the dry powder, there are times when we get quite far down a process, but there is simply a gap, either between us and another bidder or between us and the vendor.",760
18511,"2016m5","And what we're not going to do is pay too much for something.",760
18511,"2016m5","So there will be years, as we seen in the last few years, where we will struggle to put that amount of money to work.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we'll buy good quality assets off a lower amount.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we think by having more resource, we stand a better chance of hitting the GBP 500 million to GBP 700 million without going up in price too much.",760
18511,"2016m5","Iain? It's Iain Scouller from Stifel.",760
18511,"2016m5","Just on the multiple to -- that's been used to value the portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","I mean, it looks as though that might be reaching a peak.",760
18511,"2016m5","Can you give us an idea on sensitivity? I mean, if the multiple was full by 10% from about 10x to 9x, what sort of impact that would have on the return? Daniel? Coming -- a bit more commentary about the 7% earnings growth, unless there -- barring unexpected events, as you'd expect me to say, that should be a low point.",760
18511,"2016m5","And a lot of this is about the mix that's in that measure.",760
18511,"2016m5","So obviously, the sale of Element, which is one of our largest assets, with 20% growth, has come out of it.",760
18511,"2016m5","In terms of our new investments, we've got some positive investment cases there, but it's relatively early days for them to really be featuring in the calculation.",760
18511,"2016m5","And I think if you look at those companies that Simon's talked about, the AESs, Dynatects, Etancos of this world, where they have been subject to the headwinds, we're starting to see some more positive outlook for those businesses.",760
18511,"2016m5","And they are part of that change in the metric from 5 companies on the forecast earnings to 2 at this period.",760
18511,"2016m5","So yes, barring anything unexpected happening, we should see that, that sort of stabilizing and coming up from that measure.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we've recognized that we are operating in fairly tricky times.",760
18511,"2016m5","In the Slide 29, which I think is the bar chart that shows you the breakup of the earnings growth, what you've really got in that shift, I think there's GBP 373 million in the minus 1% to minus 10% bar.",760
18511,"2016m5","And what you've got in the components of that are the companies that we've just talked about.",760
18511,"2016m5","So they were sort of in the bar to the right previously, and they've shifted over to that.",760
18511,"2016m5","That's a historic chart.",760
18511,"2016m5","So it's consistent with what we've just been talking about.",760
18511,"2016m5","Thank you, Simon.",760
18511,"2016m5","As you just heard, this has been an excellent year for 3i.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our financial performance provides evidence of the resilience of our operating and business model, even against a background of volatility and uncertainty in most markets that Simon has talked about.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we continue to execute our well-defined strategy.",760
18511,"2016m5","We closed the year with very strong performance in the final quarter.",760
18511,"2016m5","We delivered NAV per share of 463p and a 21.",760
18511,"2016m5","7% return on our opening net assets.",760
18511,"2016m5","The main drivers of NAV growth contributing 77p was solid portfolio performance and successful realizations.",760
18511,"2016m5","That performance is also reflected in the increase in net carry payables with an 11p impact.",760
18511,"2016m5","We benefited from sterling's weakness, which gave us a net 16p translation gain in the year.",760
18511,"2016m5","And finally, we paid total dividends of 20p in the year.",760
18511,"2016m5","Now I know some of you like the bridge for the quarter, too, so that's in the back of the pack.",760
18511,"2016m5","The Private Equity business had a very good year.",760
18511,"2016m5","It generated gross investment return of over GBP 1 billion or 32% of opening portfolio value.",760
18511,"2016m5","And that's an excellent performance, especially in these tricky market conditions.",760
18511,"2016m5","P/E realizations of GBP 743 million include 11 smaller and older assets and GBP 179 million from the sale of Element.",760
18511,"2016m5","It was one of our largest assets, and the sale was at a money multiple of 3.",760
18511,"2016m5","The uplift of 14% is lower than last year, and that just reflects the fact that GBP 111 million of the proceeds were from sales of our quoted investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","And the weight of the transactions was early in the year, so most of the exit value had been reflected in the opening NAV.",760
18511,"2016m5","So we're continuing to make good progress in reshaping the portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we've put a slide in the back of the pack to give you full details of all the realizations.",760
18511,"2016m5","Now although the total number of investments reduced, the Private Equity portfolio value increased to GBP 3.",760
18511,"2016m5","7 billion, supported by a number of material value increases in our largest assets.",760
18511,"2016m5","On a really positive note, the GBP 690 million of unrealized value growth is underpinned by the performance of the portfolio, that is, earnings growth and changes in net debt.",760
18511,"2016m5","The performance of assets valued on an earnings basis accounted for GBP 460 million of the uplift, and they had value-weighted average earnings growth of 17%.",760
18511,"2016m5","If you exclude Action with its earnings growth of over 30%, the average is 7%.",760
18511,"2016m5","I'll come back to how that's changed in the year in a minute.",760
18511,"2016m5","But first, I'd like to spend a couple of minutes on some of the other drivers of value growth.",760
18511,"2016m5","GBP 95 million came from a net increase in the multiples we used to value the portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","The 2 biggest contributions came from Action and Basic-Fit.",760
18511,"2016m5","We've increased Action's multiple by 0.",760
18511,"2016m5","5 turn to 14x.",760
18511,"2016m5","That increase in the multiple reflects continuing strength in its performance and its outlook for growth.",760
18511,"2016m5","We also increased the multiple used to value Basic-Fit.",760
18511,"2016m5","You will have seen Tuesday's announcement of its intention to float, which means I can't give you the actual multiple today.",760
18511,"2016m5","But if you exclude Basic-Fit and Action from the average, then the increase in average multiples is just less than 1% to previous count.",760
18511,"2016m5","There have been reports of further delays in the opening of the Fixed Link that would compete with Scandlines.",760
18511,"2016m5","We have not reflected possible delays to the full extent that we could have, but we've delayed our opening assumption by 3 years.",760
18511,"2016m5","So the DCF value has increased and the biggest -- is the biggest factor in the GBP 124 million that you can see here.",760
18511,"2016m5","We announced the sales of Amor and Mayborn in April.",760
18511,"2016m5","Both transactions should be complete by the end of June.",760
18511,"2016m5","They are the 2 investments valued on an imminent sales basis.",760
18511,"2016m5","Coming back then to earnings growth in the portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","Overall, the portfolio continued to perform well, and our monthly portfolio monitoring helps us tackle any issues potentially arising, as they are bound to do in these tricky conditions.",760
18511,"2016m5","Value-weighted earnings growth over the last 12 months was 17%, including the significant contribution from Action, which is obviously the majority of the far right bar here.",760
18511,"2016m5","Excluding Action's contribution, growth is still a healthy 7%, but it's come down during the course of the year and was 12% in Q3.",760
18511,"2016m5","There are a few factors that explain the reduction.",760
18511,"2016m5","The sale of Element plays a part.",760
18511,"2016m5","The measure also reflects the performance of the likes of AES, Dynatect, Etanco and JMJ that Simon has talked about.",760
18511,"2016m5","We expect the macro environment to remain challenging and volatile.",760
18511,"2016m5","But barring unexpected events, it looks as though 7% should be the low point for a portfolio well-positioned in chosen sectors and markets with good momentum.",760
18511,"2016m5","As you can see here, we're expecting a positive trend in the majority of our top 20 investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","All this good performance flows through to the recognition of our carry.",760
18511,"2016m5","We reached an important milestone at the 31st of March 2016.",760
18511,"2016m5","Improvements in the Eurofund V performance means we have recognized carry receivable on that fund for the first time for accounting purposes.",760
18511,"2016m5","Eurofund V was valued at 0.",760
18511,"2016m5","6x in 2009.",760
18511,"2016m5","At the 31st of March 2016, its multiple is now 1.",760
18511,"2016m5","Consistent with how we recognize carry payable, the receivable is calculated as if we sold all the assets at the 31st of March 2016 valuations.",760
18511,"2016m5","This is the biggest component of the GBP 58 million receivable you see here.",760
18511,"2016m5","On the payables side, most of the schemes are now through their respective performance hurdles from an accounting perspective.",760
18511,"2016m5","We generally accrue at between 10% and 15% of gross investment return on those schemes, and we recognized a charge of GBP 171 million.",760
18511,"2016m5","Private Equity returns are usually in capital form.",760
18511,"2016m5","The business made a good contribution to income, all the more so as the contribution from fee income will continue to fall as we sell investments held in third-party funds.",760
18511,"2016m5","In total, we generated GBP 50 million of income, including GBP 30 million of dividends and interest from the portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","We also expect Infrastructure to provide a significant contribution to our operating cash income, and it's continued to do so in this year.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our 34% investment in 3iN delivered a GBP 33 million increase in value, as the share price is resilient in the face of volatile equity markets.",760
18511,"2016m5","We received ordinary dividends of GBP 21 million in addition to the GBP 51 million special dividend, which is included on our realization proceeds.",760
18511,"2016m5","We also recognized a performance fee of GBP 20 million based on 3iN's NAV, which reflects another year of strong performance.",760
18511,"2016m5","As Simon said, Debt Management had a good year of fundraising.",760

18511,"2016m5","We will then pay an additional final dividend that is not limited by the 15% to 20% formula.",760
18511,"2016m5","That final dividend will depend on the level and outlook of investments, realizations and our balance sheet.",760
18511,"2016m5","That additional dividend will still be subject to gross debt being less than GBP 1 billion and group gearing less than 20%, but we don't believe that, that is likely to be a constraint.",760
18511,"2016m5","So 2016 has been an excellent year for 3i.",760
18511,"2016m5","These financial results provide further evidence of our resilience and the value of our clear, consistent strategy and disciplined approach to investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","Thank you, and we're now happy to take questions.",760
18511,"2016m5","Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",760
18511,"2016m5","A couple of questions for me.",760
18511,"2016m5","I wondered if you could provide any more color around your comments to the, the 7% earnings growth ex Action as the confidence of that sort of being a trough.",760
18511,"2016m5","Is that due to the timing of new investments coming online? Is there anything you can point to in terms of, I guess, proportion of forecast accounts that gives that confidence? Second question, I had a question on Slide 29 where you detailed the earnings momentum in those buckets.",760
18511,"2016m5","The 5 assets that you outlined as sort of more problematic, you've commented on them before, that seemed to be about GBP 270 million of value, but there's about GBP 470 million there with negative earnings momentum.",760
18511,"2016m5","So any more color on what else is in there outside of those 5 assets? Yes, I mean, they feature in our portfolio monitoring meetings, and there are some signs of stability coming back into those businesses.",760
18511,"2016m5","We've seen in the industrial sector generally having a bit more of a positive outlook than maybe -- it looked quite gloomy at the end of last year and coming into early this year.",760
18511,"2016m5","Well, I think we indicated in Julia's presentation that we're looking to invest EUR 500 million to EUR 700 million this year.",760
18511,"2016m5","And I think that is the type of level that we think is the right level, given the current market conditions and the scale of the mid-market in particular.",760
18511,"2016m5","We have probably the broadest platform in the mid-market amongst any of our competitors with the office network we have.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we are seeing more opportunities and more flow in Germany and the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","in particular.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we would like to resource up those teams.",760
18511,"2016m5","But because of the dry powder, there are times when we get quite far down a process, but there is simply a gap, either between us and another bidder or between us and the vendor.",760
18511,"2016m5","And what we're not going to do is pay too much for something.",760
18511,"2016m5","So there will be years, as we've seen in the last few years, where we will struggle to put that amount of money to work.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we'll buy good quality assets of a lower amount.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we think by having more resource, we stand a better chance of hitting the EUR 500 million to EUR 700 million without going up in price too much.",760
18511,"2016m5","Iain? Good morning, everyone.",760
18511,"2016m5","Welcome to 3i's final results for the year to the 31st of March 2016.",760
18511,"2016m5","Since we last spoke, we've had another very productive 6 months, and we closed this year with strong returns across the group, giving us excellent momentum as we move into the new financial year.",760
18511,"2016m5","We've made very good progress against our key KPIs.",760
18511,"2016m5","We closed the year with a 22% total return on equity, net cash of  GBP 165 million and an increased dividend of 22p for the year.",760
18511,"2016m5","NAV has increased by 17% to 463p.",760
18511,"2016m5","And group operating cash profit has increased again to GBP 37 million.",760
18511,"2016m5","All of our divisions have performed well, and the group's portfolio of investments is coping well with the various macroeconomic challenges.",760
18511,"2016m5","And the longer-term reshaping of 3i continues.",760
18511,"2016m5","We're building on the foundations of our 3-year restructuring.",760
18511,"2016m5","It's been a volatile year for the markets, but we have made further good progress.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we enter FY '17 with a more focused portfolio of high-quality investments, good cost and investment discipline and a solid balance sheet.",760
18511,"2016m5","And going forward, we remain focused on executing our well-established strategy and maintaining a disciplined approach to new investment.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our international platform and sector experience, combined with our proprietary capital approach, gives us important competitive advantages in the mid-market where we compete.",760
18511,"2016m5","There's no question that both the macro and geopolitical environment has become a lot more challenging, and it's clear that headwinds have reduced growth in many sectors and geographies over the last 12 months.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we remain confident of achieving returns in excess of 2x by sticking to the mid-market and by maintaining the rigor of our investment assessments and active management approach.",760
18511,"2016m5","But in the investment world, it's not just macro headwinds that are the problem today.",760
18511,"2016m5","You've also got to contend with the sheer amount of money looking for a home.",760
18511,"2016m5","Even though M&A activity and growth in the last year or 2 has been up and down, fundraising has stayed at historically high levels.",760
18511,"2016m5","And today, we now have record amounts of dry powder across the Private Equity sector.",760
18511,"2016m5","The vast majority of the dry powder is in the mega funds, many of which we avoid while focused on the mid-market.",760
18511,"2016m5","So we've got to maintain our discipline on new investments and be energetic and creative in looking for opportunities in those sectors and geographies we know well.",760
18511,"2016m5","In line with that approach, we have decided to optimize our team resources by reducing our investment team for Scandinavia, and at the same time, we're increasing our resources in the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","and Germany.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our Private Equity team has had another busy year.",760
18511,"2016m5","They delivered a 32% return on the year, another good level of realizations, as well as making 3 interesting new investments, having looked at many more.",760
18511,"2016m5","We started FY '16 selling or listing many of our older or smaller investments, and that led to a further rationalization in the size of our portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","But the divestment environment became a lot more challenging in the second half, where our activity was fortunately more focused on some of our bigger and stronger assets.",760
18511,"2016m5","The Element sale process coped well with the deteriorating circumstances, as did the Action refinancing.",760
18511,"2016m5","But our Mayborn exit was not helped by weaker debt markets and a flatter profit profile for that business.",760
18511,"2016m5","But in the end, we were pleased with the terms for Mayborn, when we finally announced the sale at 3.",760
18511,"2016m5","5x money multiple in April this year.",760
18511,"2016m5","Earnings growth has remained strong across our Private Equity portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our larger bucket 1 investments have made a big contribution to the growth.",760
18511,"2016m5","And while we have avoided direct exposure to oil or commodities or to many emerging markets, we have nonetheless suffered from oil-related issues with JMJ, Dynatect and AES, and Julia will give you more detail on that shortly.",760
18511,"2016m5","In the case of JMJ, our safety consultancy business, 65% of revenues are from the oil and gas sector.",760
18511,"2016m5","And so their trading has been hit hard by the reductions in capital expenditure plans.",760
18511,"2016m5","As a result, we're working closely with management to take costs out of the business and to diversify into new sectors such as aerospace.",760
18511,"2016m5","The Russian economy and the reduced spending power of Russian consumers has had a negative impact on trading of Agent Provocateur.",760
18511,"2016m5","And Etanco, our roofing system business, continues to suffer from low levels of construction activity in France.",760
18511,"2016m5","At the other end of the spectrum, we have the mighty Action.",760
18511,"2016m5","Action delivered another year of 30%-plus sales growth accompanied by strong like-for-likes and excellent EBITDA and cash flow growth.",760
18511,"2016m5","The significant store opening program continued, with 144 new openings last year.",760
18511,"2016m5","Action has even more openings planned for this year, with expansion in the 2 deep markets of France and Germany going particularly well.",760
18511,"2016m5","But the crucial thing for Action last year was the selection of a new CFO and a new CEO.",760
18511,"2016m5","Management is always a critical element in our Private Equity investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","And Frederik Lotz and Sander van der Laan, I am confident we've got 2 very capable executives who will take Action on to even better performance.",760
18511,"2016m5","And I hope many of you will come to our Investor Day on the 8th of June.",760
18511,"2016m5","You can meet Frederik and Sander and form your own view.",760
18511,"2016m5","FY '16 was another year to be highly disciplined when reviewing new investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","And having had a very full width to consider, we narrowed our investments down to just 3 quality acquisitions in Euro-Diesel, Weener Plastic and Audley Travel.",760
18511,"2016m5","In each case, we had to persevere with the process where the early running was inevitably made by others who were unable to maintain their early leadership based on aggressive valuations.",760
18511,"2016m5","We're satisfied that in all 3 cases, we have bought promising businesses at fair prices with realistic plans to achieve our 2x hurdle.",760
18511,"2016m5","And in the case of Audley Travel, we were able to use our strong balance sheet to underwrite the debt and truncate the sale process to our advantage.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our Private Equity portfolio continues to evolve and is now even more dominated by those investments where we feel confident of making our 2x return or better.",760
18511,"2016m5","It is also more manageable, since we reduced our overall number of investments down to 47 companies by the end of March.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we are planning to streamline it further during the current year.",760
18511,"2016m5","We're confident in the portfolio we have put together over the last few years, and we believe our thorough research and price discipline will be well rewarded.",760
18511,"2016m5","Quality Private Equity portfolios have a certain shape to them, 1 or 2 stars and lots of solid returners, around 2x or better, with no or very few material losses.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our current portfolio, with no -- is beginning to look more like that.",760
18511,"2016m5","CVC have their racing cars and Electra have their caravans.",760
18511,"2016m5","But we have our Action stores as well as a good group of other companies capable of returning better than 2x.",760
18511,"2016m5","You've seen the results on Element, Mayborn and Amor recently.",760
18511,"2016m5","And we have plenty of other strong performers, including Basic-Fit, Scandlines and ATESTEO, which I haven't talked about today.",760
18511,"2016m5","And importantly, in recent years, we've managed to avoid the material investment misjudgments which have plagued 3i in the past.",760
18511,"2016m5","Now I don't mean to sound complacent
[Audio Gap] 
and about some of the misguided regulation we face.",760
18511,"2016m5","But I do feel that through our stronger processes and experience, we're a little more in control of the things that matter to our performance.",760
18511,"2016m5","Now I'd like to turn to Infrastructure, where we've engineered a mini-revolution in the pace of activity at 3iN.",760
18511,"2016m5","We've changed the management of our Infrastructure team, and we agreed on a change in financial return and investment mandate for 3iN.",760
18511,"2016m5","At the same time, we overhauled and added to the origination capability in our Infrastructure team.",760
18511,"2016m5","We're now seeing the fruits of those changes.",760
18511,"2016m5","We're benefiting from a stronger origination performance combined with steady asset management, which has been the hallmark of 3iN's past.",760
18511,"2016m5","As a result, 3iN has had a more all-round year of performance.",760
18511,"2016m5","And they're putting together a very interesting collection of midsized core Infrastructure assets, which are aligned to the group's midsized focus and operational experience.",760
18511,"2016m5","The Infrastructure sector is arguably suffering from even more acute dry powder issues than Private Equity.",760
18511,"2016m5","That's why the importance of our change in focus cannot be understated.",760
18511,"2016m5","The new approach should underpin the growth in returns of 3iN going forward.",760
18511,"2016m5","And as a result, the 3i Group intends to support the placing announced by 3iN on the 12th of May last week.",760
18511,"2016m5","Debt Management faced some very challenging market conditions in FY '16, but they performed well, both financially and in protecting the creditworthiness of their portfolios.",760
18511,"2016m5","The team raised GBP 1.",760
18511,"2016m5","3 billion of new CLO AUM before those markets closed in January, and they made a strong cash contribution to the group's operating cash income.",760
18511,"2016m5","Importantly, the underlying credit performance of our CLO investments in the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","and Europe remain sound and confidence in the CLO market is recovering.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our effectiveness at generating strong returns and passing cash back to shareholders has taken another good step forward this year, and that underpins our confidence in increasing this year's dividend and in enhancing the dividend policy going forward.",760
18511,"2016m5","Our future performance will be determined by the consistency of our investment and asset management processes and by the quality of the investment portfolio we have put together.",760
18511,"2016m5","And while we can't be immune to the macro and political volatility that we see everywhere we look, we remain confident of our ability to produce at least 2x returns from a good level of realizations.",760
18511,"2016m5","If we continue to hit that target, we should deliver mid- to high-teens net returns to our shareholders.",760
18511,"2016m5","And in years like this one, with some excellent realizations, shareholders can expect to see 20%-plus returns.",760
18511,"2016m5","Now I'll pass over to Julia.",760
18511,"2016m5","Philip? I just wonder could you say a little bit about your plans for new investment, because I understand your point about wanting to be selective and focus on your core competencies.",760
18511,"2016m5","How much new investment are you targeting this year? How do you think the outlook is looking now compared to a year ago? How much do you think your hiring in the U.",760
18511,"2016m5","and Germany will facilitate that? And more generally, what do you think is kind of the right level of investment you need to remain relevant and to recycle your capital? It's Iain Scouller from Stifel.",760
18511,"2016m5","Just on the multiple to -- that's been used to value the portfolio.",760
18511,"2016m5","I mean, it looks as though that might be reaching a peak.",760
18511,"2016m5","Can you give us an idea on sensitivity? I mean, if the multiple was to fall by 10% from about 10x to 9x, what sort of impact that would have on the return? But you indicate you are seeing a bit of reasons for more optimism in those 5 assets? It has been heavily impacted by a couple of changes of the bigger investments.",760
18511,"2016m5","It's not a general move up.",760
18511,"2016m5","Anyone else? No Brexit, no Action? Okay.",760
18511,"2016m5","Well, thanks for coming, everyone.",760
18511,"2016m5","And have a good day.",760
18511,"2016m5","Not very easily is the answer, because it's such a mix of the different -- the different businesses.",760
18511,"2016m5","So we don't normally think about it like that.",760
18511,"2016m5","As I said, that you've got 2 big components in there, clearly is the multiple that we use to value Action at 14x.",760
18511,"2016m5","I can't give you the multiple that we've used to value Basic-Fit, but it's obviously relative to the announcement that we made on Tuesday.",760
18511,"2016m5","I mean, the spread of the multiples that we use is about 5.",760
18511,"2016m5","But they tend to concentrate around the average more normally.",760
18511,"2017m11","Thanks, Simon.",909
18511,"2017m11","So with a total return of 11% and over GBP 500 million of new investment completed, we closed the period with an NAV per share of 652p.",909
18511,"2017m11","You can see here, how we generated that 652p of NAV.",909
18511,"2017m11","The 61p of strong performance from our portfolio companies.",909
18511,"2017m11","We've got a multi-distribution from FX of 6p.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that compares to about 30p this time last year.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we paid our final dividend of 18.",909
18511,"2017m11","5p in July.",909
18511,"2017m11","For those of you who are interested in quarter-on-quarter movement, there is a bridge in the back of the pack, but the shape is pretty much the same.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our Private Equity business was the biggest contributor to our returns, generating GBP 715 million of gross investment return.",909
18511,"2017m11","Realized profits of GBP 53 million on GBP 350 million of proceeds, with an uplift on opening book value of 21%.",909
18511,"2017m11","Those realized profits came mainly from the sales of menorah, the Spanish funeral services provider and at [indiscernible], our last Brazilian investment.",909
18511,"2017m11","This was a strong half with good performance from Action, Scandlines and our more recent investments, which together contributed to GBP 517 million value growth.",909
18511,"2017m11","When you add the GBP 500 million of new investments, as Simon just talked about, portfolio is now valued at GBP 5.",909
18511,"2017m11","7 billion and that's up from GBP 4.",909
18511,"2017m11","8 billion at the start of the period.",909
18511,"2017m11","Over 90% of the portfolio by value, has grown earnings and this is a profile of earnings [ of our ] top 20 investments.",909
18511,"2017m11","Action has another excellent period but as you can see, it is moved from 30% bar to the 29% bar this time.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that's reflected in the company's investment in its growth agenda, particularly in its distribution centers and logistics.",909
18511,"2017m11","The growing contribution that we're getting from investments we have made since the change in our strategy is also important.",909
18511,"2017m11","They make up all of the company's in the greater than 30% category, and the rest of the greater than 20% category.",909
18511,"2017m11","Together with Action, these were the biggest contributors to the GBP 283 million of performance in the value growth analysis that you can see here.",909
18511,"2017m11","Now as you know, we tend to use multiples based on longer-term sector averages.",909
18511,"2017m11","If we think that the current multiples in the comparable companies have expanded well ahead of longer-term sector trends.",909
18511,"2017m11","In a couple of cases, we reviewed our investment positions relative to these longer-term averages and the concepts.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we have been moved these up multiples to reflect that performance.",909
18511,"2017m11","This time, we have done that for a small number of assets, including [ AAS  ]and the [ ten code ].",909
18511,"2017m11","This not substantial re-ratings but they do largely explain the GBP 59 million movement here.",909
18511,"2017m11","We have made no change to the multiple that we use to value Action, which remains at 16x post discount run rate.",909
18511,"2017m11","These changes to multiples have flowed through the weighted average multiples for those assets that we valued on an earnings basis.",909
18511,"2017m11","And it also includes the effect of some of the investments made in the period, such as Lampenwelt and Cirtec, which were in higher rated sectors.",909
18511,"2017m11","As a result, the weighted average has increased from 9.",909
18511,"2017m11","9x post discount at March to 10.",909
18511,"2017m11","Turning then to our Infrastructure business.",909
18511,"2017m11","Just to remind you, the significant majority of our investment return currently comes from our 34% investment in 3iN , which now sits results last week.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our team have also raised 2 new funds, the 3i managed Infrastructure acquisitions fund and the 3i  European operations projects fund.",909
18511,"2017m11","So far, these funds have added GBP 830 million to our assets under management.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we have committed GBP 69 million to those funds.",909
18511,"2017m11","And as you have just heard, our U.",909
18511,"2017m11","Infrastructure team have announced their first new investment since the period end.",909
18511,"2017m11","Because of these new initiatives, we don't have a material impact on the numbers for our Infrastructure business in the first half, so the gross investment return of GBP 32 million comes mainly from the good share price performance of 3iN.",909
18511,"2017m11","Together with [ it's ] dividend income, and the fee income from our associated advisory agreement.",909
18511,"2017m11","This income means our Infrastructure business is already a good contributor to operating cash income.",909
18511,"2017m11","As expected, our cash costs exceeded our cash income by GBP 16 million in the first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","Because we no longer have the income from the Debt Management business.",909
18511,"2017m11","But that measure will also be improved by infrastructures fundraising initiatives.",909
18511,"2017m11","So this has been a good half or 3iN in terms of performance, but importantly, also in terms of investment.",909
18511,"2017m11","We were net investors in the period as we saw a good number of attractive investment opportunities.",909
18511,"2017m11","In total, we have invested GBP 572 million, all funded from our strong balance sheet.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we realized GBP 374 million from Private Equity and from the residual Debt Management business.",909
18511,"2017m11","We started the year with net cash of GBP 419 million, and liquidity of GBP 1.",909
18511,"2017m11","After the investments realization activity that we've been talking about, and paying the final dividend, we have net debt of GBP 48 million and liquidity of GBP 877 million at the 30th of September.",909
18511,"2017m11","Looking forward to the remainder of the year and, of course, subject to the usual caveats about market conditions, with a strong pipeline of realizations, we expect the profile of investments and realizations to reverse in the second half compared to the first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","We'll also be paying our interim dividend in the second half.",909
18511,"2017m11","So to remind you about our dividend policy.",909
18511,"2017m11","We pay a base dividend of 16p, half of which is paid as an interim and half as a final.",909
18511,"2017m11","We'll also pay an additional dividend with the final.",909
18511,"2017m11","We set the amounts of that additional dividend by taking account, of our outlook for investments and realizations and the strength of our balance sheet.",909
18511,"2017m11","You'll be familiar with this slide, which shows the distribution to shareholders, or a fundamental part of our capital allocation model.",909
18511,"2017m11","So our portfolio continues to perform well.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we've made an excellent new investments, which means we are well positioned to deliver continued growth.",909
18511,"2017m11","Thank you, and will now take questions.",909
18511,"2017m11","Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",909
18511,"2017m11","A couple of questions from me.",909
18511,"2017m11","First one Action's growth profile you clearly detailed in the slide that it's dipped into that 20% to 29% bracket.",909
18511,"2017m11","I think earlier in the year, you said expectations of Action's growth profile in 2017 been similar rated to 2016.",909
18511,"2017m11","From your comments it's sounded like the story opening is heavily biased instead of final quarter of calendar year.",909
18511,"2017m11","So do you see as just this temporary dip into that bracket? Can we see it recovering back into the more than 30% category? Is it just temporary around store opening? Second question is the 1 asset you outlined in your slide Simon, where there's been value declines in the half with Schlemmer and nearly purchase asset you knew that was requiring turnaround when you bought it.",909
18511,"2017m11","So where have you been negatively surprised I guess, this quarter is small valuation reduction on that specific asset, please? Just 2 questions.",909
18511,"2017m11","One is just in terms of your cash return objective.",909
18511,"2017m11","Looking at the realizations you've made in the last 12 to 18 months in terms of where you look at the many multiple is being above 2x.",909
18511,"2017m11","So just in terms of how are you thinking about the objective of 2x cash return, going forward, especially when you consider your existing portfolio assets.",909
18511,"2017m11","And then secondly, just in terms of your least offer 20 top investments noticed the Scandlines is missing there.",909
18511,"2017m11","Is it a [indiscernible] interim sales? Okay.",909
18511,"2017m11","Good morning.",909
18511,"2017m11","Welcome to 3i's results presentation.",909
18511,"2017m11","It's been another strong half for 3i.",909
18511,"2017m11","With our strategy driving good levels of activity, and solid returns.",909
18511,"2017m11","We took another good step forward in portfolio performance.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we sold assets at decent uplifts.",909
18511,"2017m11","And our Private Equity team made significant new investments like [indiscernible] in and Holland and [ Formel D ] in Germany.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we had a strong fundraising performance in Infrastructure.",909
18511,"2017m11","This has delivered another strong financial result, with a total return of [ 11% in the half.",909
18511,"2017m11","] This table throws up an interesting perspective.",909
18511,"2017m11","Not any against the restructuring baseline in 2012, but the this months return equals our full year return in 2015, underlying the strong consistent year-on-year value growth of our portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we have entered the second half of the year with good momentum across both divisions.",909
18511,"2017m11","Again, the portfolio has performed well this year but I'm also glad to see a good level of new investment in Private Equity.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our Private Equity team has delivered an excellent return with a GIR of 15%.",909
18511,"2017m11","91% of our top 20 assets grew their earnings in the first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that's another good indication of the quality of our portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we made over GBP 0.",909
18511,"2017m11","5 billion of new investments, as well as doing some significant bolt on acquisitions.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our portfolios performed well and delivered decent growth across-the-board with very few write-downs.",909
18511,"2017m11","Apart from Action, the strongest growth has come from those companies, we have invested in since our restructuring.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that relatively young 2013-16 portfolio has already delivered 1.",909
18511,"2017m11","9x cost and value growth so far.",909
18511,"2017m11","Action continues to perform strongly.",909
18511,"2017m11","For financial reporting, Action uses 13 periods of [ full ] weeks and the numbers in our interims are taken from their period 9, which finished on the 10th of September.",909
18511,"2017m11","Action had opened 111 new stores by that date and is on track to open more than 230 stores by the end of 2017.",909
18511,"2017m11","As of yesterday, Action had opened the 192 stores and now has a total of 1044.",909
18511,"2017m11","So that's a significant step from last year and a major ramp up in this quarter in particular.",909
18511,"2017m11","That's an ambitious growth initiatives and even after significant levels of new investment in stores, distribution centers, country offices and central functions, like for likes in cash flow remain very strong.",909
18511,"2017m11","Without increasing Action's multiple, we have seen half a million of value growth in the last 12 months alone.",909
18511,"2017m11","And the major store expansion program in this final quarter will create further significant momentum for 3i second half valuation.",909
18511,"2017m11","We produced a marked set up in our origination activity this year.",909
18511,"2017m11","Origination has always been a great strength for 3i.",909
18511,"2017m11","The group led the PE Sector in establishing the European network of offices in the '80s and '90s.",909
18511,"2017m11","And now that we have dealt with most of our legacy issues, our investment teams have been freed up to focus on origination against some tighten and carefully considered criteria.",909
18511,"2017m11","That change of focus means a good share of our recent investments have been sourced directly, away from competitive bank driven auction processes.",909
18511,"2017m11","This chart puts this year's activity in context.",909
18511,"2017m11","We have invested about GBP 2 billion of capital since our restructuring, but half of that GBP 2 billion has been invested over the last 15 months alone.",909
18511,"2017m11","In addition, we entered the second half with a strong pipeline of new and follow-on investment activity.",909
18511,"2017m11","I would now like to talk on a couple of our recent investments.",909
18511,"2017m11","[ Cirtec ] was our most recent investment, like Q Holding's, it operates in the medical device sector and like Q, Cirtec is capable of being a platform asset that will combine strong levels of organic growth with M&A.",909
18511,"2017m11","3i's international credentials were particularly useful and convincing the CEO that we were the right partner for his ambitious plans.",909
18511,"2017m11","I'm very excited about our investment in Lampenwelt, which is the largest specialty online retailer of lighting products in Europe.",909
18511,"2017m11","The business was started in Germany in 2004 by 2 brothers, who were both electrical engineers.",909
18511,"2017m11","Lampenwelt is a classic online disruptive retailer.",909
18511,"2017m11","It already operates in 14 European markets and is planning to selectively expand its geographic footprint further across Europe.",909
18511,"2017m11","We spotted the business when we were doing a due diligence scan of the sector.",909
18511,"2017m11","As part of our review last year of the sale of SLV, another lighting company.",909
18511,"2017m11","One of our German network contacts knew the company and was able to make an introduction that led directly to an entirely off market transaction.",909
18511,"2017m11","Lampenwelt is already highly profitable and generates lots of cash.",909
18511,"2017m11","So I have a little doubt that it will become one of our highest growing companies very quickly.",909
18511,"2017m11","As I said a minute ago, we are also seeing a good level of [ Bolton ] activity across the portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","Power has the potential to become another important platform asset for 3i.",909
18511,"2017m11","And [ Arsa ] is another important step on that journey.",909
18511,"2017m11","Now I'd like to turn to the portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","We have raised GBP 350 million, 2.",909
18511,"2017m11","7x cost on realizations in the first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we move into the second half with a number of important processes in terrain.",909
18511,"2017m11","As long as markets remain resilient, we expect to raise significantly more cash from refinancings and realizations in the second half.",909
18511,"2017m11","Here is the investment bucket slide, that we have been showing you for the last few years.",909
18511,"2017m11","And as you can see, the top 2 buckets continue to dominate the makeup of the portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","Basic-Fit continues to grow strongly as a public company and first go now subject to take a private bid from the PAI.",909
18511,"2017m11","Now what about Infrastructure? They produced another good half with a strong performance from 3iN, good levels of cash income for the group and a number of important new fund initiatives.",909
18511,"2017m11","The 3iN portfolio with its recent core plus additions is performing strongly and several of its larger core assets are now undergoing strategic reviews.",909
18511,"2017m11","The return for 3i's shareholders on the 3iN June 2006 equity placing is now at a very respectable 22%.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we have made our first move into U.",909
18511,"2017m11","Infrastructure.",909
18511,"2017m11","With the announcement of our acquisition of Smarte Carte.",909
18511,"2017m11","Smarte Carte is the leading provider of airport baggage cards and self-storage lockers across the U.",909
18511,"2017m11","Infrastructure team is already performing well.",909
18511,"2017m11","And they are coming up with a good flow of interesting investment ideas.",909
18511,"2017m11","We intend to fund Infrastructure investment in initially from our own balance sheet with a view to deploying third-party capital in due course.",909
18511,"2017m11","So another good half for 3i.",909
18511,"2017m11","With the Private Equity and the Infrastructure teams producing good levels of alpha in their respective sectors.",909
18511,"2017m11","As well as significant income for the group from Infrastructure.",909
18511,"2017m11","Today, our portfolio is producing excellent returns.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we now have only a small number of underperformance.",909
18511,"2017m11","Importantly, the macro-economic environment across our chosen geographies and sectors is better than it has been for some time.",909
18511,"2017m11","Even if the politics remains very, very tricky.",909
18511,"2017m11","Technology advances and globalization are both having a greater and greater impact on every commercial sector.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we remain very focused on buying companies that can thrive in this fast changing environment.",909
18511,"2017m11","Without that competitive edge or resilience, companies across many different sectors are facing formidable and accelerating challenges.",909
18511,"2017m11","So testing our company's readiness for the full and resilience in the face of rapid digital change is an essential part of our pre-investment reviews.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our teams are energized about what they're doing.",909
18511,"2017m11","And they are setting high standards in international mid-market investing.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we are already benefiting from consistent investment processes and discipline.",909
18511,"2017m11","In fact, I am really struck by how much simpler we have made our business and our investment portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","And how much more straightforward it is to focus and set the right priorities across the group.",909
18511,"2017m11","We entered the second half with good earnings momentum, and a good pipeline of new investments and business initiatives.",909
18511,"2017m11","On our current portfolio looks like it should general, generate return significantly better then our two times target.",909
18511,"2017m11","I'll now pass over to Julia.",909
18511,"2017m11","Taking Action first.",909
18511,"2017m11","I mean, again, to set things in perspective until a couple of years ago, Action was working with 1 distribution center.",909
18511,"2017m11","It then opened another on the Southern Dutch border.",909
18511,"2017m11","And then it opened its third distribution center last year, Marcy.",909
18511,"2017m11","It's actually opened 2 this year.",909
18511,"2017m11","1 in the south of France, and 1 in Germany.",909
18511,"2017m11","And it's invested more into Marcy, the distributions center around Paris.",909
18511,"2017m11","The significant people and systems costs that go with all of that, but the goal is to reduce those transport mild costs that you face as the company broadens their geographically.",909
18511,"2017m11","So we all accelerating the store rollout program, and we are accelerating the support that goes with that.",909
18511,"2017m11","So there will be an impact upon if you like the margin for the business this year.",909
18511,"2017m11","It's not hugely material, it will still be spectacular growth at the top line and at the EBITDA line.",909
18511,"2017m11","But it has tripped below 30% at this point.",909
18511,"2017m11","Schlemmer, is -- it was a business that we purchased in the knowledge that we have to make a lot of changes too, because it hadn't already been as a Private Equity business that we would focus on.",909
18511,"2017m11","It has a significant growth agenda but there's a lot of effective management that can be brought into it.",909
18511,"2017m11","We have been particularly focused on changing 1 pont in Germany and dealing with some operational problems that they had in North America.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that's really affected the results in the current year.",909
18511,"2017m11","Top line growth in Schlemmer is very stronger.",909
18511,"2017m11","Well, why deal with the first one and Julia can deal with the second one on carry.",909
18511,"2017m11","I mean the portfolio has a number of different characteristics about it.",909
18511,"2017m11","So you've got the big beast Action, which really is still by far in the way most significant investment.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that's all about managing our growth agenda.",909
18511,"2017m11","It is a car driving at 100 miles an hour and ensuring that the rest of the operation can keep up with our remarkable store opening teams.",909
18511,"2017m11","We are now up to opening 16 stores a week in the busy period of Action.",909
18511,"2017m11","And as you can imagine, these stores are not small stores.",909
18511,"2017m11","They put a lot of pressure on the rest of the system.",909
18511,"2017m11","You need to feed the store opening beast.",909
18511,"2017m11","So that is all operational agenda and it's about getting your investment in front of your store opening program.",909
18511,"2017m11","So that's the critical challenge there and that takes up a great deal of that management time as well as our own time.",909
18511,"2017m11","We have acquired a number of our executives focused on supporting action.",909
18511,"2017m11","You've then got some very stable businesses that are much more focused on the growth agenda.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that can be both organic and it can be M&A.",909
18511,"2017m11","And I would say a big theme that you will see this year is consistent levels of M&A coming out of what I call our platform assets.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we are picking that back up again because the business are growing strongly and they now have the market positions and are confident enough to step out and make some important M&A.",909
18511,"2017m11","So significant value adds and synergies coming of that.",909
18511,"2017m11","You saw that the gain you acquisition for Q, we talked about that in September.",909
18511,"2017m11","This [indiscernible] acquisition is a very important 1.",909
18511,"2017m11","And there are others in the pipeline that we're pretty advanced on it at this point.",909
18511,"2017m11","And then the third category is some of the stuff we buy of market is stuff that hasn't been made ready for sale to a Private Equity party.",909
18511,"2017m11","So there's quite a bit of work left on it.",909
18511,"2017m11","And Schlemmer is the classic example of that.",909
18511,"2017m11","And so we are often fine with stuff like that.",909
18511,"2017m11","The trade off with getting had a better price than if it had been ready to sold through a bank option, is that we have the asset management that company quite intensively for the first couple of years.",909
18511,"2017m11","We have to reorganize.",909
18511,"2017m11","We very often replace the CFO quite quickly.",909
18511,"2017m11","We might make bigger, bigger executive changes even then now once we get within the business.",909
18511,"2017m11","But as a part of the portfolio that represents that type of asset.",909
18511,"2017m11","And again, that represents considerable upside over time, but it takes a bit of a while to get your hands around the problems and get the company moving forward in the way you like.",909
18511,"2017m11","So there's a nice blend of different challenges in the portfolio, and it's what makes us stimulating for the investment teams and for the Investment Committee to sit above all of this.",909
18511,"2017m11","I think you said fiendishly complicated, which is probably about right.",909
18511,"2017m11","The carry is a percentage of gross investment return is lower in this period, the guidance that we're getting in the past is 10% to 15% of gross investment return, and we said we expect to be at lower end of that range.",909
18511,"2017m11","I would still say it's a rule of thumb that should be what you sort of working towards it is fiendishly complicated to choose your words and in a particular period, we will have a particular makes of where the value growth is coming from which can drive some different numbers that's what really happened in this first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","But the only thing I can really say is if you stick with that, overall 10% to 15% and very much low end of that over time, that should, roughly about right sort of level.",909
18511,"2017m11","I'll let -- I think I can deal with those 2.",909
18511,"2017m11","I mean, the 2x cash that we talked about going back to 2012 it's a very simple measure that would drive a net 15%, 16% type return of the carry payments and cost the platform to shareholders.",909
18511,"2017m11","So it delivers a very respectable return in the context of financial services sector in the stock market.",909
18511,"2017m11","I mean what we're seeing today is a very different portfolio with very different makeup far more high-growth companies, far more companies behaving as they should generating significant growth.",909
18511,"2017m11","So the 2x hurdle is looking much low hurdle than it used to look for us.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we have quite a number of assets now, which we think we'll considerably outstrip that type -- that type of hurdle.",909
18511,"2017m11","It has to be said that for a good company, this is a very good selling environment as well.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we like the rest of the industry have benefited from some of that.",909
18511,"2017m11","It's not a particularly easy environment to sell a bad company.",909
18511,"2017m11","I have to say or a challenged company.",909
18511,"2017m11","But if you're selling a good asset, there's a lot of money chasing -- chasing that sort of thing.",909
18511,"2017m11","So it's a favorable environment.",909
18511,"2017m11","But really, the driver of this is the quality of the portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","So 2x is not a demanding objective.",909
18511,"2017m11","And I think we have a whole bunch of companies that will significantly exceed that.",909
18511,"2017m11","In terms of Scandlines, it is embarking on a strategic review, and I think a lot of you know what that might mean.",909
18511,"2017m11","And it's -- we have a number of big assets that are in that phase currently.",909
18511,"2017m11","I don't read and I want to say more than that.",909
18511,"2017m11","Because it's a carefully managed process, neither want to put my foot on it.",909
18511,"2017m11","But that's about to kick off and will take place in the second half of the year.",909
18511,"2017m11","Anything else? No.",909
18511,"2017m11","Thank you for coming.",909
18511,"2017m11","Just a couple of things.",909
18511,"2017m11","Firstly, looking at your Private Equity portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","How is the balance where you see values creation changing.",909
18511,"2017m11","Are you able to focus more on the operational side that things more straightforward? Are you able to face focus indeed, more on [ Boltons ] and M&A and supporting our company through further capital allocations? How are you thinking about driving value? And what is relatively competitive market for investments? And secondly, rather more quickly, I thought the net carriers a bit low.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that was different calculation, which way beyond it but if you could talk us through a little bit about why that was that wasn't how should we think about that going forward? Any other questions? Over there.",909
18511,"2017m11","Just a couple of things.",909
18511,"2017m11","Firstly, looking at your Private Equity portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","How is the balance of where you see value creation changing? Are you able to focus more on the operational side, now things are more straightforward? Are you able to face -- focus indeed, more on bolt-ons and M&A and supporting your company through further capital allocations? How are you thinking about driving value in what is relatively competitive market for investments? And secondly and rather more pick of the -- I thought the net carriers a bit low and out of gas.",909
18511,"2017m11","And know this is a fiendishly difficult calculation, which way beyond it, but if you could talk us through a little bit about why that wasn't how we should think about that going forward, which is an awful jargon? Okay.",909
18511,"2017m11","Good morning.",909
18511,"2017m11","Welcome to 3i's results presentation.",909
18511,"2017m11","It's been another strong half for 3i with our strategy driving good levels of activity and solid returns.",909
18511,"2017m11","We took another good step forward in portfolio performance.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we sold assets at decent uplifts.",909
18511,"2017m11","And our Private Equity team made significant new investments like Hans Anders in Holland and Formel D in Germany.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we had a strong fundraising performance in Infrastructure.",909
18511,"2017m11","This has delivered another strong financial result with a total return of 11% in the half.",909
18511,"2017m11","This table throws up an interesting perspective.",909
18511,"2017m11","Not only against the restructuring baseline in 2012, but this 6 months return equals our full year return in 2015, underlying the strong consistent year-on-year value growth of our portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we have entered the second half of the year with good momentum across both divisions.",909
18511,"2017m11","Again, the portfolio has performed well this year, but I'm also glad to see a good level of new investment in Private Equity.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our Private Equity team has delivered an excellent return with a GIR of 15%.",909
18511,"2017m11","91% of our top 20 assets grew their earnings in the first half and that's another good indication of the quality of our portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we made over GBP 0.",909
18511,"2017m11","5 billion of new investments, as well as doing some significant bolt on acquisitions.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our portfolio has performed well and delivered decent growth across-the-board with very few write-downs.",909
18511,"2017m11","Apart from Action, the strongest growth has come from those companies, we have invested in since our restructuring.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that relatively young 2013-16 portfolio has already delivered 1.",909
18511,"2017m11","9x cost in value growth so far.",909
18511,"2017m11","Action continues to perform strongly.",909
18511,"2017m11","For financial reporting, Action uses 13 periods or 4 weeks and the numbers in our interims are taken from their period 9, which finished on the 10th of September.",909
18511,"2017m11","Action had opened 111 new stores by that date and is on track to open more than 230 stores by the end of 2017.",909
18511,"2017m11","As of yesterday, Action had opened 192 stores and now has a total of 1044.",909
18511,"2017m11","So that's a significant step-up from last year and a major ramp up in this quarter in particular.",909
18511,"2017m11","That's an ambitious growth initiatives and even after significant levels of new investment in stores, distribution centers, country offices and central functions, like for likes in cash flow remain very strong.",909
18511,"2017m11","Without increasing Action's multiple, we have seen half a billion of value growth in the last 12 months alone.",909
18511,"2017m11","And the major store expansion program in this final quarter will create further significant momentum for 3i's second half valuation.",909
18511,"2017m11","We've produced a marked step-up in our origination activity this year.",909
18511,"2017m11","Origination has always been a great strength of 3i.",909
18511,"2017m11","The group led the PE Sector in establishing the European network of offices in the '80s and '90s.",909
18511,"2017m11","And now that we have dealt with most of our legacy issues, our investment teams have been freed up to focus on origination against some tight and carefully considered criteria.",909
18511,"2017m11","That change of focus, means a good share of our recent investments have been sourced directly, away from competitive bank driven auction processes.",909
18511,"2017m11","This chart puts this year's activity in context.",909
18511,"2017m11","We have invested about GBP 2 billion of capital since our restructuring, but half of that GBP 2 billion has been invested over the last 15 months alone.",909
18511,"2017m11","In addition, we entered the second half with a strong pipeline of new and follow-on investment activity.",909
18511,"2017m11","I would now like to touch on a couple of our recent investments.",909
18511,"2017m11","Cirtec was our most recent investment, like Q Holding's, it operates in the medical device sector and like Q, Cirtec is capable of being a platform asset, that will combine strong levels of organic growth with M&A.",909
18511,"2017m11","3i's international credentials were particularly useful in convincing the CEO, that we were the right partner for his ambitious plans.",909
18511,"2017m11","I'm very excited about our investment in Lampenwelt, which is the largest specialty online retailer of lighting products in Europe.",909
18511,"2017m11","The business was started in Germany in 2004 by 2 brothers, who were both electrical engineers.",909
18511,"2017m11","Lampenwelt is a classic online disruptive retailer.",909
18511,"2017m11","It already operates in 14 European markets and is planning to selectively expand its geographic footprint further across Europe.",909
18511,"2017m11","We spotted the business, when we were doing a due diligence scan of the sector.",909
18511,"2017m11","As part of our review last year of the sale of SLV, another lighting company.",909
18511,"2017m11","One of our German network contacts knew the company and was able to make an introduction that led directly to an entirely off-market transaction.",909
18511,"2017m11","Lampenwelt is already highly profitable and generates lots of cash.",909
18511,"2017m11","So I have little doubt, that it will become one of our highest growing companies very quickly.",909
18511,"2017m11","As I said a minute ago, we are also seeing a good level of Bolt-on activity across the portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","Ponroy has the potential to become another important platform asset for 3i.",909
18511,"2017m11","And ERSA is another important step on that journey.",909
18511,"2017m11","Now I'd like to turn to the portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","We've raised GBP 350 million, 2.",909
18511,"2017m11","7x cost on realizations in the first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we move into the second half with a number of important processes in train.",909
18511,"2017m11","As long as markets remain resilient, we expect to raise significantly more cash from refinancings and realizations in the second half.",909
18511,"2017m11","Here is the investment bucket slide that we've been showing you for the last few years.",909
18511,"2017m11","And as you can see, the top 2 buckets continue to dominate the makeup of the portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","Basic-Fit continues to grow strongly as a public company and Refresco is now subject to take private bid from PAI.",909
18511,"2017m11","Now what about Infrastructure? They produced another good half with a strong performance from 3iN, good levels of cash income for the group and a number of important new fund initiatives.",909
18511,"2017m11","The 3iN portfolio with its recent core plus additions is performing strongly and several of its larger core assets are now undergoing strategic reviews.",909
18511,"2017m11","The return for 3i's shareholders on the 3iN June 2006 equity placing is now at a very respectable 22%.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we've made our first move into U.",909
18511,"2017m11","Infrastructure.",909
18511,"2017m11","With the announcement of our acquisition of Smarte Carte.",909
18511,"2017m11","Smarte Carte is the leading provider of airport baggage carts and self-storage lockers across the U.",909
18511,"2017m11","Infra team is already performing well and they are coming up with a good flow of interesting investment ideas.",909
18511,"2017m11","We intend to fund Infrastructure investment in the U.",909
18511,"2017m11",", initially from our own balance sheet with a view to deploying third-party capital in due course.",909
18511,"2017m11","So another good half for 3i.",909
18511,"2017m11","With the Private Equity and the Infrastructure teams producing good levels of alpha in their respective sectors.",909
18511,"2017m11","As well as significant income for the group from Infrastructure.",909
18511,"2017m11","Today, our portfolio is producing excellent returns.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we now have only a small number of underperformers.",909
18511,"2017m11","Importantly, the macro-economic environment across our chosen geographies and sectors is better than it has been for some time.",909
18511,"2017m11","Even if the politics remains very, very tricky.",909
18511,"2017m11","Technology advances and globalization are both having a greater and greater impact on every commercial sector.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we remain very focused on buying companies, that can thrive in this fast changing environment.",909
18511,"2017m11","Without that competitive edge or resilience, companies across many different sectors are facing formidable and accelerating challenges.",909
18511,"2017m11","So testing a company's readiness for the -- for and resilience in the face of rapid digital change, is an essential part of our pre-investment reviews.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our teams are energized about what they're doing.",909
18511,"2017m11","And they are setting high standards in international mid-market investing.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we are already benefiting from consistent investment processes and discipline.",909
18511,"2017m11","In fact, I am really struck by how much simpler, we have made our business and our investment portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","And how much more straightforward it is, to focus and set the right priorities across the group.",909
18511,"2017m11","We entered the second half with good earnings momentum and a good pipeline of new investments and business initiatives.",909
18511,"2017m11","On our current portfolio, it looks like, it should generate returns significantly better than our 2x target.",909
18511,"2017m11","I'll now pass over to Julia.",909
18511,"2017m11","Just 2 questions.",909
18511,"2017m11","One is just in terms of your cash return objective.",909
18511,"2017m11","Looking at the realizations you've made in the last 12 to 18 months, in terms of where you look at the mony multiple, is being above 2x.",909
18511,"2017m11","So just in terms of how are you thinking about the objective of 2x cash return, going forward, especially when you consider your existing portfolio assets? And then secondly, just in terms of your least of 20 top investments, noticed the Scandlines is missing there.",909
18511,"2017m11","Is it up for interim sale? Thanks, Simon.",909
18511,"2017m11","So with a total return of 11% and over GBP 500 million of new investment completed, we closed the period with an NAV per share of 652p.",909
18511,"2017m11","You can see here, how we generated that 652p of NAV.",909
18511,"2017m11","The 61p of strong performance from our portfolio companies.",909
18511,"2017m11","We've got more of this contribution from FX of 6p.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that compares to about 30p this time last year and we paid our final dividend of 18.",909
18511,"2017m11","5p in July.",909
18511,"2017m11","For those of you, who are interested in the quarter-on-quarter movement, there is a bridge in the back of the pack, but the shape is pretty much the same.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our Private Equity business was the biggest contributor to our returns, generating GBP 715 million of gross investment return.",909
18511,"2017m11","Realized profits of GBP 53 million on GBP 350 million of proceeds, with an uplift on opening book value of 21%.",909
18511,"2017m11","Those realized profits came mainly from the sales of Mémora, the Spanish funeral services provider and Óticas Carol, our last Brazilian investment.",909
18511,"2017m11","This was a strong half with good performance from Action, Scandlines and our more recent investments, which together contributed to the GBP 517 million value growth.",909
18511,"2017m11","When you add the GBP 500 million of new investments, as Simon just talked about, the portfolio is now valued at GBP 5.",909
18511,"2017m11","7 billion and that's up from GBP 4.",909
18511,"2017m11","8 billion at the start of the period.",909
18511,"2017m11","Over 90% of the portfolio by value, has grown earnings and this is the profile of earnings of our top 20 investments.",909
18511,"2017m11","Action has had another excellent period, but as you can see, it has moved from the 30% plus bar to the 29% bar this time.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that's reflected the company's investment in its growth agenda, particularly in its distribution centers and logistics.",909
18511,"2017m11","The growing contribution that we're getting from the investments we have made since the change in our strategy is also important.",909
18511,"2017m11","They make up all of the company's in the greater than 30% category, and the rest of the greater than 20% category.",909
18511,"2017m11","Together with Action, these were the biggest contributors to the GBP 283 million of performance in the value growth analysis that you can see here.",909
18511,"2017m11","Now as you know, we tend to use multiples based on longer-term sector averages.",909
18511,"2017m11","If we think that the current multiples in the comparable companies have expanded well ahead of longer-term sector trends.",909
18511,"2017m11","In a couple of cases, we've reviewed our investments position relative to these longer-term averages and the concepts.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we again moved these multiples up to reflect their performance.",909
18511,"2017m11","This time, we've done that for a small number of assets, including AES and Etanco.",909
18511,"2017m11","This was not substantial re-ratings, but they do largely explain the GBP 59 million movement here.",909
18511,"2017m11","We have made no change to the multiple that we use to value Action, which remains at 16x post discount run rate.",909
18511,"2017m11","These changes to multiples have flowed through the weighted average multiple, for those assets that we valued on an earnings basis.",909
18511,"2017m11","And it also includes the effect of some of the investments made in the period, such as Lampenwelt and Cirtec, which were in higher rated sectors.",909
18511,"2017m11","As a result, the weighted average has increased from 9.",909
18511,"2017m11","9x post discount at March to 10.",909
18511,"2017m11","Turning then to our Infrastructure business.",909
18511,"2017m11","Just to remind you, the significant majority of our investment return currently comes from our 34% investment in 3iN, which announced its results, last week.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our team have also raised 2 new funds, the 3i managed Infrastructure acquisitions fund and the 3i European operations projects fund.",909
18511,"2017m11","So far, these funds have added GBP 830 million to our assets under management and we have committed GBP 69 million to those funds.",909
18511,"2017m11","And as you have just heard, our U.",909
18511,"2017m11","Infrastructure team have announced their first new investment since the period end.",909
18511,"2017m11","Because of these new initiatives don't have a material impact on the numbers for our Infrastructure business in the first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","So the gross investment return of GBP 32 million comes mainly from the good share price performance of 3iN.",909
18511,"2017m11","Together with its dividend income, and the fee income from our associated advisory agreement.",909
18511,"2017m11","This income means our Infrastructure business is already a good contributor to operating cash income.",909
18511,"2017m11","As expected, our cash costs exceeded our cash income by GBP 16 million in the first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","Because we no longer have the income from the Debt Management business.",909
18511,"2017m11","But that measure will also be improved by Infrastructure's fundraising initiatives.",909
18511,"2017m11","So this has been a good half or 3iN in terms of performance, but importantly, also in terms of investment.",909
18511,"2017m11","We were net investors in the period as we saw a good number of attractive investments opportunities.",909
18511,"2017m11","In total, we have invested GBP 572 million, all funded from our strong balance sheet.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we realized GBP 374 million from Private Equity and from the residual Debt Management business.",909
18511,"2017m11","We started the year with net cash of GBP 419 million, and liquidity of GBP 1.",909
18511,"2017m11","After the investments on realization activity that we've been talking about, and paying the final dividend, we have net debt of GBP 48 million and liquidity of GBP 877 million at the 30th of September.",909
18511,"2017m11","Looking forward to the remainder of the year and of course, subject to the usual caveats about market conditions, with a strong pipeline of realizations, we expect the profile of investments and realizations to reverse in the second half compared to the first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","We'll also be paying our interim dividend in the second half.",909
18511,"2017m11","So to remind you about our dividend policy.",909
18511,"2017m11","We pay a base dividend of 16p, half of which is paid as an interim and half as a final.",909
18511,"2017m11","We'll also pay an additional dividend with the final.",909
18511,"2017m11","We set the amounts of that additional dividend by taking account, of our outlook for investments and realizations and the strength of our balance sheet.",909
18511,"2017m11","You'll be familiar with this slide, which shows the distribution to shareholders are a fundamental part of our capital allocation model.",909
18511,"2017m11","So, our portfolio continues to perform well and we've made some excellent new investments, which means we are well positioned to deliver continued growth.",909
18511,"2017m11","Thank you, and we'll now take questions.",909
18511,"2017m11","Okay, why don't I deal with the first one and Julia can deal with the second one on carry.",909
18511,"2017m11","I mean the portfolio has a number of different characteristics about it.",909
18511,"2017m11","So you've got the big beast Action, which really is still by far in a way, the most significant investment.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that's all about managing our growth agenda.",909
18511,"2017m11","It is a car driving at 100 miles an hour and ensuring that the rest of the operation can keep up with our remarkable store opening teams.",909
18511,"2017m11","We are now up to opening 16 stores a week in the busy period of Action.",909
18511,"2017m11","And as you can imagine, these stores are not small stores.",909
18511,"2017m11","They put a lot of pressure on the rest of the system.",909
18511,"2017m11","You need to feed the store opening beast.",909
18511,"2017m11","So that is all operational agenda and it's about getting your investment in front of your store opening program.",909
18511,"2017m11","So that's the critical challenge there and that takes up a great deal of that management time as well as our own time.",909
18511,"2017m11","We have quite a number of our own executives focused on supporting Action.",909
18511,"2017m11","You've then got some very stable businesses that are much more focused on a growth agenda.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that can be both organic and it can be M&A.",909
18511,"2017m11","And I would say a big theme that you will see this year is consistent levels of M&A, coming out of, what I call our platform assets.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we are picking that back up again because the businesses are growing strongly and they now have the market positions and are confident enough to step out and make some important M&A.",909
18511,"2017m11","So significant value adds and synergies coming of that.",909
18511,"2017m11","You saw that again in your acquisition for Q, we talked about that in September.",909
18511,"2017m11","This Ponroy acquisition is a very important 1.",909
18511,"2017m11","And there are others in the pipeline that we're pretty advanced on it, at this point.",909
18511,"2017m11","And then the third category is some of the stuff we buy of market, is stuff that hasn't been made ready for sale to a Private Equity party.",909
18511,"2017m11","So there's quite a bit of work left in it.",909
18511,"2017m11","And Schlemmer is the classic example of that.",909
18511,"2017m11","And so we are often fine with stuff like that.",909
18511,"2017m11","The trade off with getting it at a better price, than if it had been ready to be sold through a bank auction, is that we have to asset manage that company quite intensively.",909
18511,"2017m11","For the first couple of years, we have to reorganize.",909
18511,"2017m11","We very often replace the CFO quite quickly.",909
18511,"2017m11","We might make bigger, bigger executive changes even then that, once we get within the business.",909
18511,"2017m11","But there is a part of the portfolio that represents that type of asset.",909
18511,"2017m11","And again, that represents considerable upside over time, but it takes a bit of a while to get your hands around the problems and get the company moving forward in the way you like.",909
18511,"2017m11","So there's a nice blend of different challenges in the portfolio, and it's what makes it stimulating for the investment teams and for the Investment Committee to sit above all of this.",909
18511,"2017m11","Any other questions? Over there.",909
18511,"2017m11","Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",909
18511,"2017m11","A couple of questions for me.",909
18511,"2017m11","First on Action's growth profile, you clearly detailed in the slide that it's dipped into that 20% to 29% bracket.",909
18511,"2017m11","I think earlier in the year, you'd said expectations of Action's growth profile in 2017 been similar rate to 2016.",909
18511,"2017m11","From your comments, it sounded like the store opening is heavily biased, at this final quarter of the calendar year.",909
18511,"2017m11","So do you see as just temporarily, that is dipped into that bracket? Can we see it recovering back into the more than 30% category? Is it just temporary around store opening? Second question is the 1 asset you outlined in your slides, I mean, of where there has been some value declines in the half with Schlemmer and nearly purchased asset, you knew that was requiring turnaround when you bought it.",909
18511,"2017m11","So where have you been negatively surprised, I guess, that this caused that small valuation reduction on that specific asset, please? Okay.",909
18511,"2017m11","Taking Action first.",909
18511,"2017m11","I mean, again, to set things in perspective until a couple of years ago, Action was working with 1 distribution center.",909
18511,"2017m11","It then opened another on the Southern Dutch border and then it opened its third distribution center last year, Moissy.",909
18511,"2017m11","It's actually opened 2 this year.",909
18511,"2017m11","1 in the south of France, 1 in Germany and it's invested more into Moissy, the distribution center around Paris.",909
18511,"2017m11","The significant people and systems costs that go with all of that, but the goal is to reduce those transport mild cost that you face as the company broadens out geographically.",909
18511,"2017m11","So we are accelerating the store rollout program, and we are accelerating the support that goes with that.",909
18511,"2017m11","So there will be an impact upon, if you like the margin for the business this year.",909
18511,"2017m11","It's not hugely material, it will still be spectacular growth at the top line and at the EBITDA line.",909
18511,"2017m11","But it has tripped it below 30% at this point.",909
18511,"2017m11","Schlemmer, is -- it was a business that we purchased in the knowledge, that we would have to make quite a lot of changes too, because it hadn't really been run as a Private Equity business that we would focus on.",909
18511,"2017m11","It has a significant growth agenda, but there is a lot of effective management that can be brought into it.",909
18511,"2017m11","We have been particularly focused on changing 1 plant in Germany and dealing with some operational problems that they had in North America.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that's really affected the results in the current year.",909
18511,"2017m11","Top line growth in Schlemmer is very strong there.",909
18511,"2017m11","I think you said fiendishly complicated, which is probably about right.",909
18511,"2017m11","The carry is a percentage of gross investment return is lower in this period, the guidance that we're getting in the past is 10% to 15% of gross investment return, and we've said, we expect to be at lower end of that range.",909
18511,"2017m11","I would still say, as a rule of thumb, that should be what you sort of working towards and it is fiendishly complicated to use your words and in a particular period, we will have a particular mix of where the value growth is coming from, which can drive some different numbers and that's really what has happened in this first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","But the only thing I can really say is, if you stick with that overall 10% to 15% and very much the lower end of that, over time, that should come out roughly about the right sort of level.",909
18511,"2017m11","Let -- I think I can deal with those 2.",909
18511,"2017m11","I mean, the 2x cash that we talked about, going back to 2012, was just a very simple measure that would drive a net 15%, 16% type return of the carry payments and cost the platform to shareholders.",909
18511,"2017m11","So it delivers a very respectable return in the context of the financial services sector in the stock market.",909
18511,"2017m11","I mean what we're seeing today is a very different portfolio with a very different makeup.",909
18511,"2017m11","Far more high-growth companies, far more companies behaving as they should and generating significant growth.",909
18511,"2017m11","So the 2x hurdle is looking much lower hurdle than it used to look for us.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we have quite a number of assets now, which we think will considerably outstrip that type of hurdle.",909
18511,"2017m11","It has to be said, that for a good company this is a very good selling environment as well.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we like the rest of the industry have benefited from some of that.",909
18511,"2017m11","It's not a particularly easy environment to sell a bad company.",909
18511,"2017m11","I have to say or a challenged company.",909
18511,"2017m11","But if you're selling a good asset, there's a lot of money chasing that sort of thing.",909
18511,"2017m11","So it's a favorable environment, but really, the driver of this is the quality of the portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","So 2x is not a demanding objective and I think we have a whole bunch of companies that will significantly exceed that.",909
18511,"2017m11","In terms of Scandlines, it is embarking on a strategic review, and I think a lot of you know, what that might mean? And it's -- we have a number of big assets that are in that phase currently.",909
18511,"2017m11","I don't -- really don't want to say more than that, because it's a carefully managed process and I don't want to put my foot in it.",909
18511,"2017m11","But that is about to kick off and will take place in the second half of our year.",909
18511,"2017m11","Anything else? No.",909
18511,"2017m11","Thank you for coming.",909
18511,"2017m11","Taking Action first.",909
18511,"2017m11","I mean, again, to set things in perspective, until a couple of years ago, Action was working with one distribution center.",909
18511,"2017m11","It then opened another on the southern Dutch border and then it opened its third distribution center last year at Moissy.",909
18511,"2017m11","It's actually opened 2 this year, one in the south of France, one in Germany, and it's invested more into Moissy, the distribution center around Paris.",909
18511,"2017m11","There's significant people and systems costs that go with all of that, but the goal is to reduce those transport mile costs that you face as the company broadens out geographically.",909
18511,"2017m11","So we are accelerating the store rollout program, and we're accelerating the support that goes with that.",909
18511,"2017m11","So there will be an impact upon, if you like, the margin for the business this year.",909
18511,"2017m11","It's not hugely material.",909
18511,"2017m11","It will still be spectacular growth at the top line and at the EBITDA line.",909
18511,"2017m11","But it has tripped it below 30% at this point.",909
18511,"2017m11","Schlemmer, is -- it was a business that we purchased in the knowledge that we'd have to make quite a lot of changes to because it hadn't really been run as a Private Equity business that we would focus on.",909
18511,"2017m11","It has a significant growth agenda, but there is a lot of effective management that can be brought into it.",909
18511,"2017m11","We've been particularly focused on changing up one plant in Germany and dealing with some operational problems that they had in North America.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that's really affected the results in the current year.",909
18511,"2017m11","Top line growth in Schlemmer is very strong there.",909
18511,"2017m11","Okay, why don't I deal with the first one, and Julia can deal with the second one on carry.",909
18511,"2017m11","I mean the portfolio has a number of different characteristics about it.",909
18511,"2017m11","So you've got the big beast Action, which really is still by far and away the most significant investment.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that's all about managing a growth agenda.",909
18511,"2017m11","It is a car driving at 100 miles an hour, and ensuring that the rest of the operation can keep up with our remarkable store opening teams.",909
18511,"2017m11","We are now up to opening 16 stores a week in the busy period of Action.",909
18511,"2017m11","And as you can imagine, these stores are not small stores.",909
18511,"2017m11","They put a lot of pressure on the rest of the system.",909
18511,"2017m11","You need to feed the store opening beast.",909
18511,"2017m11","So that is all operational agenda, and it's about getting your investment in front of your store opening program.",909
18511,"2017m11","So that's the critical challenge there, and that takes up a great deal of that management time as well as our own time.",909
18511,"2017m11","We have quite a number of our own executives focused on supporting Action.",909
18511,"2017m11","You've then got some very stable businesses that are much more focused on a growth agenda, and that can be both organic and it can be M&A.",909
18511,"2017m11","And I would say a big theme that you will see this year is consistent levels of M&A coming out of what I call our platform assets.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we're picking that back up again because the businesses are growing strongly and they now have the market positions and are confident enough to step out and make some important M&A.",909
18511,"2017m11","So significant value adds and synergies coming off that.",909
18511,"2017m11","You saw the Degania acquisition for Q.",909
18511,"2017m11","We talked about that in September.",909
18511,"2017m11","This Ponroy acquisition is a very important one.",909
18511,"2017m11","And there are others in the pipeline that we're pretty advanced on at this point.",909
18511,"2017m11","And then the third category is some of the stuff we buy off market is stuff that hasn't been made ready for a sale to a private equity party, so there's quite a bit of work left in it.",909
18511,"2017m11","And Schlemmer is the classic example of that.",909
18511,"2017m11","And so we'll often find with stuff like that, the trade off with getting it at a better price than if it had been ready to be sold through a bank auction is that we have to asset manage that company quite intensively for the first couple of years.",909
18511,"2017m11","We have to reorganize.",909
18511,"2017m11","We very often replace the CFO quite quickly.",909
18511,"2017m11","We might make bigger executive changes even then that, once we get within the business.",909
18511,"2017m11","But there's a part of the portfolio that represents that type of asset.",909
18511,"2017m11","And again, that represents considerable upside over time, but it takes a bit of a while to get your hands around the problems and get the company moving forward in the way you'd like.",909
18511,"2017m11","So there's a nice blend of different challenges in the portfolio, and it's what makes it stimulating for the investment teams and for the Investment Committee to sit above all of this.",909
18511,"2017m11","Just 2 questions.",909
18511,"2017m11","One is just in terms of your cash return objective.",909
18511,"2017m11","Looking at the realizations you've made in the last 12 to 18 months, in terms of where you look at the money multiple, it's been above 2x.",909
18511,"2017m11","So just in terms of how are you thinking about the objective of 2x cash return going forward, especially when you consider your existing portfolio assets? And then secondly, just in terms of your list of 20 top investments, I noticed that Scandlines is missing there.",909
18511,"2017m11","Is it up for interim sale? I think you said fiendishly complicated, which is probably about right.",909
18511,"2017m11","The carry as a percentage of gross investment return is lower in this period.",909
18511,"2017m11","The guidance that we've given you in the past is 10% to 15% of gross investment return, and we've said we expect to be at lower end of that range.",909
18511,"2017m11","I would still say as a rule of thumb that should be what you're sort of working towards.",909
18511,"2017m11","It is fiendishly complicated, to use your words, and in a particular period, we'll have a particular mix of where the value growth has come from, which can drive some different numbers, and that's really what's happened in this first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","But the only thing I can really say is if you stick with that overall 10% to 15%, and very much the lower end of that, over time, that should come out roughly about the right sort of level.",909
18511,"2017m11","Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",909
18511,"2017m11","A couple of questions from me.",909
18511,"2017m11","First on Action's growth profile, you clearly detail in the slide that it's dipped into that 20% to 29% bracket.",909
18511,"2017m11","I think earlier in the year, you'd said expectations of Action's growth profile in 2017 would be a similar rate to 2016.",909
18511,"2017m11","From your comments, it sounded like the store opening is heavily biased to sort of this final quarter of the calendar year.",909
18511,"2017m11","So do you see it as just temporarily that it's dipped into that bracket? Can we see it recovering back into the more than 30% category? Is it just temporary around store opening? The second question is the one asset you outlined in your slide, Simon, of where there's been some value declines in the half is Schlemmer, a newly sort of purchased asset.",909
18511,"2017m11","You knew that was requiring a turnaround when you bought it.",909
18511,"2017m11","So where have you been negatively surprised, I guess, that this caused that small valuation reduction on that specific asset, please? [indiscernible] Just a couple of things.",909
18511,"2017m11","Firstly, looking at your Private Equity portfolio, how is the balance of where you see value creation changing? Are you able to focus more on the operational side now that things are more straightforward? Are you able to face -- focus, indeed, more on bolt-ons and M&A and supporting your company through further capital allocations? How are you thinking about driving value in what is a relatively competitive market for investments? And secondly, and rather more pickily, I thought that the net carry was a bit lower than I'd have guessed.",909
18511,"2017m11","I know this is a fiendishly difficult calculation which is way beyond me, but if you could talk us through a little bit about why that was and how we should think about that going forward, which is awful jargon.",909
18511,"2017m11","Good morning.",909
18511,"2017m11","Welcome to 3i's results presentation.",909
18511,"2017m11","It's been another strong half for 3i, with our strategy driving good levels of activity and solid returns.",909
18511,"2017m11","We took another good step forward in portfolio performance, and we sold assets at decent uplifts.",909
18511,"2017m11","And our Private Equity team made significant new investments like Hans Anders in Holland and Formel D in Germany.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we had a strong fundraising performance in Infrastructure.",909
18511,"2017m11","This has delivered another strong financial result with a total return of 11% in the half.",909
18511,"2017m11","This table throws up an interesting perspective not only against the restructuring baseline in 2012, but this 6-month return equals our full year return in 2015, underlying the strong, consistent year-on-year value growth of our portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we've entered the second half of the year with good momentum across both divisions.",909
18511,"2017m11","Again, the portfolio has performed well this year, but I'm also glad to see a good level of new investment in Private Equity.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our Private Equity team has delivered an excellent return, with a GIR of 15%.",909
18511,"2017m11","91% of our top 20 assets grew their earnings in the first half, and that's another good indication of the quality of our portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we made over GBP 0.",909
18511,"2017m11","5 billion of new investments, as well as doing some significant bolt-on acquisitions.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our portfolio has performed well and delivered decent growth across-the-board with very few write-downs.",909
18511,"2017m11","Apart from Action, the strongest growth has come from those companies we've invested in since our restructuring.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that relatively young 2013-16 portfolio has already delivered 1.",909
18511,"2017m11","9x costs in value growth so far.",909
18511,"2017m11","Action continues to perform strongly.",909
18511,"2017m11","For financial reporting, Action uses 13 periods, or 4 weeks, and the numbers in our interims are taken from their period 9, which finished on the 10th of September.",909
18511,"2017m11","Action had opened 111 new stores by that date and is on track to open more than 230 stores by the end of 2017.",909
18511,"2017m11","As of yesterday, Action had opened 192 stores and now has a total of 1,044.",909
18511,"2017m11","So that's a significant step up from last year and a major ramp up in this quarter in particular.",909
18511,"2017m11","That's an ambitious growth initiative, and even after significant levels of new investment in stores, distribution centers, country offices and central functions, like for likes and cash flow remain very strong.",909
18511,"2017m11","Without increasing Action's multiple, we've seen GBP 0.",909
18511,"2017m11","5 billion of value growth in the last 12 months alone.",909
18511,"2017m11","And the major store expansion program in this final quarter will create further significant momentum for 3i's second half valuation.",909
18511,"2017m11","We've produced a marked step-up in our origination activity this year.",909
18511,"2017m11","Origination has always been a great strength of 3i.",909
18511,"2017m11","The group led the PE Sector in establishing a European network of offices in the '80s and '90s.",909
18511,"2017m11","And now that we have dealt with most of our legacy issues, our investment teams have been freed up to focus on origination against some tight and carefully considered criteria.",909
18511,"2017m11","That change of focus means a good share of our recent investments have been sourced directly, away from competitive bank-driven auction processes.",909
18511,"2017m11","This chart puts this year's activity in context.",909
18511,"2017m11","We've invested about GBP 2 billion of capital since our restructuring, but half of that GBP 2 billion has been invested over the last 15 months alone.",909
18511,"2017m11","In addition, we enter the second half with a strong pipeline of new and follow-on investment activity.",909
18511,"2017m11","I'd now like to touch on a couple of our recent investments.",909
18511,"2017m11","Cirtec was our most recent investment.",909
18511,"2017m11","Like Q Holding's, it operates in the medical device sector, and like Q, Cirtec is capable of being a platform asset that will combine strong levels of organic growth with M&A.",909
18511,"2017m11","3i's international credentials were particularly useful in convincing the CEO that we were the right partner for his ambitious plans.",909
18511,"2017m11","I'm very excited about our investment in Lampenwelt, which is the largest specialty online retailer of lighting products in Europe.",909
18511,"2017m11","The business was started in Germany in 2004 by 2 brothers, who were both electrical engineers.",909
18511,"2017m11","Lampenwelt is a classic online disruptive retailer.",909
18511,"2017m11","It already operates in 14 European markets and is planning to selectively expand its geographic footprint further across Europe.",909
18511,"2017m11","We spotted the business when we were doing a due diligence scan of the sector as part of our review last year of the sale of SLV, another lighting company.",909
18511,"2017m11","One of our German network contacts knew the company and was able to make an introduction that led directly to an entirely off-market transaction.",909
18511,"2017m11","Lampenwelt is already highly profitable and generates lots of cash.",909
18511,"2017m11","So I have little doubt that it will become one of our highest growing companies very quickly.",909
18511,"2017m11","As I said a minute ago, we're also seeing a good level of bolt-on activity across the portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","Ponroy has the potential to become another important platform asset for 3i.",909
18511,"2017m11","And ERSA is another important step on that journey.",909
18511,"2017m11","Now I'd like to turn to the portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","We've raised GBP 350 million at 2.",909
18511,"2017m11","7x cost on realizations in the first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we move into the second half with a number of important processes in train.",909
18511,"2017m11","As long as markets remain resilient, we expect to raise significantly more cash from refinancings and realizations in the second half.",909
18511,"2017m11","Here's the investment bucket slide that we've been showing you for the last few years.",909
18511,"2017m11","And as you can see, the top 2 buckets continue to dominate the makeup of the portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","Basic-Fit continues to grow strongly as a public company, and Refresco is now subject to a take private bid from PAI.",909
18511,"2017m11","Now what about Infrastructure? They produced another good half, with a strong performance from 3iN, good levels of cash income for the group and a number of important new fund initiatives.",909
18511,"2017m11","The 3iN portfolio, with its recent core plus additions, is performing strongly, and several of its larger core assets are now undergoing strategic reviews.",909
18511,"2017m11","The return for 3i's shareholders on the 3iN June 2006 equity placing is now at a very respectable 22%.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we've made our first move into U.",909
18511,"2017m11","Infrastructure with the announcement of our acquisition of Smarte Carte.",909
18511,"2017m11","Smarte Carte is the leading provider of airport baggage carts and self-storage lockers across the U.",909
18511,"2017m11","Infra team is already performing well, and they are coming up with a good flow of interesting investment ideas.",909
18511,"2017m11","We intend to fund Infrastructure investments in the U.",909
18511,"2017m11","initially from our own balance sheet, with a view to deploying third-party capital in due course.",909
18511,"2017m11","So another good half for 3i, with the Private Equity and the Infrastructure teams producing good levels of alpha in their respective sectors, as well as significant income for the group from Infrastructure.",909
18511,"2017m11","Today, our portfolios are producing excellent returns, and we now have only a small number of underperformers.",909
18511,"2017m11","Importantly, the macro-economic environment across our chosen geographies and sectors is better than it has been for some time, even if the politics remains very, very tricky.",909
18511,"2017m11","Technology advances and globalization are both having a greater and greater impact on every commercial sector, and we remain very focused on buying companies that can thrive in this fast-changing environment.",909
18511,"2017m11","Without that competitive edge or resilience, companies across many different sectors are facing formidable and accelerating challenges.",909
18511,"2017m11","So testing a company's readiness for the -- for and resilience in the face of rapid digital change is an essential part of our pre-investment reviews.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our teams are energized about what they are doing.",909
18511,"2017m11","And they are setting high standards in international mid-market investing.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we are already benefiting from consistent investment processes and discipline.",909
18511,"2017m11","In fact, I am really struck by how much simpler we have made our business and our investment portfolio and how much more straightforward it is to focus and set the right priorities across the group.",909
18511,"2017m11","We enter the second half with good earnings momentum and a good pipeline of new investments and business initiatives.",909
18511,"2017m11","On our current portfolio, it looks like it should generate returns significantly better than our 2x target.",909
18511,"2017m11","I'll now pass over to Julia.",909
18511,"2017m11","Any other questions? Over here.",909
18511,"2017m11","Let -- I think I can deal with those 2.",909
18511,"2017m11","I mean, the 2x cash that we talked about going back to 2012 was just a very simple measure that would drive a net 15%, 16% type return after carry payments and costs of the platform to shareholders.",909
18511,"2017m11","So it delivers a very respectable return in the context of the financial services sector in the stock market.",909
18511,"2017m11","I mean, what we're seeing today is a very different portfolio with very different makeup.",909
18511,"2017m11","Far more high-growth companies, far more companies behaving as they should and generating significant growth.",909
18511,"2017m11","So the 2x hurdle is looking much lower hurdle than it used to look for us.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we have quite a number of assets now which we think will considerably outstrip that type of hurdle.",909
18511,"2017m11","It has to be said that for a good company, this is a very good selling environment as well.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we, like the rest of the industry, have benefited from some of that.",909
18511,"2017m11","It's not a particularly easy environment to sell a bad company, I have to say, or a challenged company.",909
18511,"2017m11","But if you're selling a good asset, there's a lot of money chasing that sort of thing.",909
18511,"2017m11","So it's a favorable environment, but really, the driver of this is the quality of the portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","So 2x is not a demanding objective, and I think we have a whole bunch of companies that will significantly exceed that now.",909
18511,"2017m11","In terms of Scandlines, it is embarking on a strategic review, and I think a lot of you know what that might mean.",909
18511,"2017m11","And it's -- we have a number of big assets that are in that phase currently.",909
18511,"2017m11","I don't -- really don't want to say more than that, because it's a carefully managed process and I don't want to put my foot in it.",909
18511,"2017m11","But that is about to kick off and will take place in the second half of our year.",909
18511,"2017m11","Anything else? 
No.",909
18511,"2017m11","Thank you for coming.",909
18511,"2017m11","Thanks, Simon.",909
18511,"2017m11","So with a total return of 11% and over GBP 500 million of new investment completed, we close the period with an NAV per share of 652p.",909
18511,"2017m11","You can see here how we generated that 652p of NAV, with 61p of strong performance from our portfolio companies.",909
18511,"2017m11","We got a modest contribution from FX of 6p, and that compares to about 30p this time last year.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we paid our final dividend at 18.",909
18511,"2017m11","5p in July.",909
18511,"2017m11","For those of you who are interested in the quarter-on-quarter movement, there is a bridge in the back of the pack, but the shape is pretty much the same.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our Private Equity business was the biggest contributor to our returns, generating GBP 715 million of gross investment return.",909
18511,"2017m11","Realized profits of GBP 53 million on GBP 350 million of proceeds was an uplift on opening book value of 21%.",909
18511,"2017m11","Those realized profits came mainly from the sales of Mémora, the Spanish funeral services provider and Óticas Carol, our last Brazilian investment.",909
18511,"2017m11","This was a strong half, with good performance from Action, Scandlines and our more recent investments, which together contributed to the GBP 517 million value growth.",909
18511,"2017m11","When you add the GBP 500 million of new investments that Simon's just talked about, the portfolio is now valued at GBP 5.",909
18511,"2017m11","7 billion, and that's up from GBP 4.",909
18511,"2017m11","8 billion at the start of the period.",909
18511,"2017m11","Over 90% of the portfolio, by value, has grown earnings, and this is the profile of earnings of our top 20 investments.",909
18511,"2017m11","Action has had another excellent period, but as you can see, it has moved from the 30% plus bar to the 29% bar this time, and that's reflecting the company's investment in its growth agenda, particularly in its distribution centers and logistics.",909
18511,"2017m11","The growing contribution that we're getting from the investments that we've made since the change in our strategy is also important.",909
18511,"2017m11","They make up all of the companies in the greater than 30% category, and the rest of the greater than 20% category.",909
18511,"2017m11","Together with Action, these were the biggest contributors to the GBP 283 million of performance in the value growth analysis that you can see here.",909
18511,"2017m11","Now as you know, we tend to use multiples based on longer-term sector averages.",909
18511,"2017m11","If we think that the current multiples in the comparable companies have expanded well ahead of longer-term sector trends.",909
18511,"2017m11","In a couple of cases, we've reviewed our investments position relative to these longer-term averages and the concepts and we've then moved these multiples up to reflect their performance.",909
18511,"2017m11","This time, we've done that for a small number of assets, including AES and Etanco.",909
18511,"2017m11","These were not substantial re-ratings, but they do largely explain the GBP 59 million movement here.",909
18511,"2017m11","We've made no change to the multiple that we used to value Action, which remains at 16x post discount run rate.",909
18511,"2017m11","These changes to multiples have flowed through to the weighted average multiple for those assets that we valued on an earnings basis, and it also includes the effect of some of the investments made in the period, such as Lampenwelt and Cirtec, which were in higher rated sectors.",909
18511,"2017m11","As a result, the weighted average has increased from 9.",909
18511,"2017m11","9x post discount at March to 10.",909
18511,"2017m11","Turning then to our Infrastructure business.",909
18511,"2017m11","Just to remind you, the significant majority of our investment return currently comes from our 34% investment in 3iN, which announced its results last week.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our team have also raised 2 new funds, the 3i Managed Infrastructure Acquisitions fund and the 3i European Operations Projects fund.",909
18511,"2017m11","So far, these funds have added GBP 830 million to our assets under management, and we have committed GBP 69 million to those funds.",909
18511,"2017m11","And as you've just heard, our U.",909
18511,"2017m11","Infrastructure team have announced their first new investment since the period end.",909
18511,"2017m11","Of course, these new initiatives don't have a material impact on the numbers for our Infrastructure business in the first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","So the gross investment return of GBP 32 million comes mainly from the good share price performance of 3iN, together with its dividend income and the fee income from our associated advisory agreement.",909
18511,"2017m11","This income means our Infrastructure business is already a good contributor to operating cash income.",909
18511,"2017m11","As expected, our cash costs exceeded our cash income by GBP 16 million in the first half because we no longer have the income from the Debt Management business.",909
18511,"2017m11","But that measure will also be improved by Infrastructure's fundraising initiatives.",909
18511,"2017m11","So this has been a good half for 3iN in terms of performance but, importantly, also in terms of investment.",909
18511,"2017m11","We were net investors in the period as we saw a good number of attractive investments opportunities.",909
18511,"2017m11","In total, we've invested GBP 572 million, all funded from our strong balance sheet, and we realized GBP 374 million from Private Equity and from the residual Debt Management business.",909
18511,"2017m11","We started the year with net cash of GBP 419 million and liquidity of GBP 1.",909
18511,"2017m11","After the investment and realization activity that we've been talking about, and paying the final dividend, we have net debt of GBP 48 million and liquidity of GBP 877 million at the 30th of September.",909
18511,"2017m11","Looking forward to the remainder of the year, and of course subject to the usual caveats about market conditions, with a strong pipeline of realizations, we expect the profile of investments and realizations to reverse in the second half compared to the first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","We'll also be paying our interim dividend in the second half.",909
18511,"2017m11","So to remind you about our dividend policy, we pay a base dividend of 16p, half of which is paid as an interim and half as a final.",909
18511,"2017m11","We'll also pay an additional dividend with the final.",909
18511,"2017m11","We set the amount of that additional dividend by taking account of our outlook for investments and realizations and the strength of our balance sheet.",909
18511,"2017m11","You'll be familiar with this slide, which shows that distributions to shareholders are a fundamental part of our capital allocation model.",909
18511,"2017m11","So our portfolio continues to perform well, and we've made some excellent new investments, which means we are well positioned to deliver continued growth.",909
18511,"2017m11","Thank you, and we'll now take questions.",909
18511,"2017m11","Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",909
18511,"2017m11","A couple of questions from me.",909
18511,"2017m11","First on Action's growth profile, you clearly detail in the slide that it's dipped into that 20% to 29% bracket.",909
18511,"2017m11","I think earlier in the year, you'd said expectations of Action's growth profile in 2017 would be a similar rate to 2016.",909
18511,"2017m11","From your comments, it sounded like the store opening is heavily biased to sort of this final quarter of the calendar year.",909
18511,"2017m11","So do you see it as just temporarily that it's dipped into that bracket? Can we see it recovering back into the more than 30% category? Is it just temporary around store opening? The second question is the one asset you outlined in your slide, Simon, of where there's been some value declines in the half is Schlemmer, a newly sort of purchased asset.",909
18511,"2017m11","You knew that was requiring a turnaround when you bought it.",909
18511,"2017m11","So where have you been negatively surprised, I guess, that this caused that small valuation reduction on that specific asset, please? Okay.",909
18511,"2017m11","Let -- I think I can deal with those 2.",909
18511,"2017m11","I mean, the 2x cash that we talked about going back to 2012 was just a very simple measure that would drive a net 15%, 16% type return after carry payments and costs of the platform to shareholders.",909
18511,"2017m11","So it delivers a very respectable return in the context of the financial services sector in the stock market.",909
18511,"2017m11","I mean, what we're seeing today is a very different portfolio with very different makeup.",909
18511,"2017m11","Far more high-growth companies, far more companies behaving as they should and generating significant growth.",909
18511,"2017m11","So the 2x hurdle is looking much lower hurdle than it used to look for us.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we have quite a number of assets now which we think will considerably outstrip that type of hurdle.",909
18511,"2017m11","It has to be said that for a good company, this is a very good selling environment as well.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we, like the rest of the industry, have benefited from some of that.",909
18511,"2017m11","It's not a particularly easy environment to sell a bad company, I have to say, or a challenged company.",909
18511,"2017m11","But if you're selling a good asset, there's a lot of money chasing that sort of thing.",909
18511,"2017m11","So it's a favorable environment, but really, the driver of this is the quality of the portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","So 2x is not a demanding objective, and I think we have a whole bunch of companies that will significantly exceed that now.",909
18511,"2017m11","In terms of Scandlines, it is embarking on a strategic review, and I think a lot of you know what that might mean.",909
18511,"2017m11","And it's -- we have a number of big assets that are in that phase currently.",909
18511,"2017m11","I don't -- really don't want to say more than that, because it's a carefully managed process and I don't want to put my foot in it.",909
18511,"2017m11","But that is about to kick off and will take place in the second half of our year.",909
18511,"2017m11","Anything else? 
No.",909
18511,"2017m11","Thank you for coming.",909
18511,"2017m11","[indiscernible] Just a couple of things.",909
18511,"2017m11","Firstly, looking at your Private Equity portfolio, how is the balance of where you see value creation changing? Are you able to focus more on the operational side now that things are more straightforward? Are you able to face -- focus, indeed, more on bolt-ons and M&A and supporting your company through further capital allocations? How are you thinking about driving value in what is a relatively competitive market for investments? And secondly, and rather more pickily, I thought that the net carry was a bit lower than I'd have guessed.",909
18511,"2017m11","I know this is a fiendishly difficult calculation which is way beyond me, but if you could talk us through a little bit about why that was and how we should think about that going forward, which is awful jargon.",909
18511,"2017m11","I think you said fiendishly complicated, which is probably about right.",909
18511,"2017m11","The carry as a percentage of gross investment return is lower in this period.",909
18511,"2017m11","The guidance that we've given you in the past is 10% to 15% of gross investment return, and we've said we expect to be at lower end of that range.",909
18511,"2017m11","I would still say as a rule of thumb that should be what you're sort of working towards.",909
18511,"2017m11","It is fiendishly complicated, to use your words, and in a particular period, we'll have a particular mix of where the value growth has come from, which can drive some different numbers, and that's really what's happened in this first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","But the only thing I can really say is if you stick with that overall 10% to 15%, and very much the lower end of that, over time, that should come out roughly about the right sort of level.",909
18511,"2017m11","Taking Action first.",909
18511,"2017m11","I mean, again, to set things in perspective, until a couple of years ago, Action was working with one distribution center.",909
18511,"2017m11","It then opened another on the southern Dutch border and then it opened its third distribution center last year at Moissy.",909
18511,"2017m11","It's actually opened 2 this year, one in the south of France, one in Germany, and it's invested more into Moissy, the distribution center around Paris.",909
18511,"2017m11","There's significant people and systems costs that go with all of that, but the goal is to reduce those transport mile costs that you face as the company broadens out geographically.",909
18511,"2017m11","So we are accelerating the store rollout program, and we're accelerating the support that goes with that.",909
18511,"2017m11","So there will be an impact upon, if you like, the margin for the business this year.",909
18511,"2017m11","It's not hugely material.",909
18511,"2017m11","It will still be spectacular growth at the top line and at the EBITDA line.",909
18511,"2017m11","But it has tripped it below 30% at this point.",909
18511,"2017m11","Schlemmer, is -- it was a business that we purchased in the knowledge that we'd have to make quite a lot of changes to because it hadn't really been run as a Private Equity business that we would focus on.",909
18511,"2017m11","It has a significant growth agenda, but there is a lot of effective management that can be brought into it.",909
18511,"2017m11","We've been particularly focused on changing up one plant in Germany and dealing with some operational problems that they had in North America.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that's really affected the results in the current year.",909
18511,"2017m11","Top line growth in Schlemmer is very strong there.",909
18511,"2017m11","Any other questions? Over here.",909
18511,"2017m11","Just 2 questions.",909
18511,"2017m11","One is just in terms of your cash return objective.",909
18511,"2017m11","Looking at the realizations you've made in the last 12 to 18 months, in terms of where you look at the money multiple, it's been above 2x.",909
18511,"2017m11","So just in terms of how are you thinking about the objective of 2x cash return going forward, especially when you consider your existing portfolio assets? And then secondly, just in terms of your list of 20 top investments, I noticed that Scandlines is missing there.",909
18511,"2017m11","Is it up for interim sale? Thanks, Simon.",909
18511,"2017m11","So with a total return of 11% and over GBP 500 million of new investment completed, we close the period with an NAV per share of 652p.",909
18511,"2017m11","You can see here how we generated that 652p of NAV, with 61p of strong performance from our portfolio companies.",909
18511,"2017m11","We got a modest contribution from FX of 6p, and that compares to about 30p this time last year.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we paid our final dividend at 18.",909
18511,"2017m11","5p in July.",909
18511,"2017m11","For those of you who are interested in the quarter-on-quarter movement, there is a bridge in the back of the pack, but the shape is pretty much the same.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our Private Equity business was the biggest contributor to our returns, generating GBP 715 million of gross investment return.",909
18511,"2017m11","Realized profits of GBP 53 million on GBP 350 million of proceeds was an uplift on opening book value of 21%.",909
18511,"2017m11","Those realized profits came mainly from the sales of Mémora, the Spanish funeral services provider and Óticas Carol, our last Brazilian investment.",909
18511,"2017m11","This was a strong half, with good performance from Action, Scandlines and our more recent investments, which together contributed to the GBP 517 million value growth.",909
18511,"2017m11","When you add the GBP 500 million of new investments that Simon's just talked about, the portfolio is now valued at GBP 5.",909
18511,"2017m11","7 billion, and that's up from GBP 4.",909
18511,"2017m11","8 billion at the start of the period.",909
18511,"2017m11","Over 90% of the portfolio, by value, has grown earnings, and this is the profile of earnings of our top 20 investments.",909
18511,"2017m11","Action has had another excellent period, but as you can see, it has moved from the 30% plus bar to the 29% bar this time, and that's reflecting the company's investment in its growth agenda, particularly in its distribution centers and logistics.",909
18511,"2017m11","The growing contribution that we're getting from the investments that we've made since the change in our strategy is also important.",909
18511,"2017m11","They make up all of the companies in the greater than 30% category, and the rest of the greater than 20% category.",909
18511,"2017m11","Together with Action, these were the biggest contributors to the GBP 283 million of performance in the value growth analysis that you can see here.",909
18511,"2017m11","Now as you know, we tend to use multiples based on longer-term sector averages.",909
18511,"2017m11","If we think that the current multiples in the comparable companies have expanded well ahead of longer-term sector trends.",909
18511,"2017m11","In a couple of cases, we've reviewed our investments position relative to these longer-term averages and the concepts and we've then moved these multiples up to reflect their performance.",909
18511,"2017m11","This time, we've done that for a small number of assets, including AES and Etanco.",909
18511,"2017m11","These were not substantial re-ratings, but they do largely explain the GBP 59 million movement here.",909
18511,"2017m11","We've made no change to the multiple that we used to value Action, which remains at 16x post discount run rate.",909
18511,"2017m11","These changes to multiples have flowed through to the weighted average multiple for those assets that we valued on an earnings basis, and it also includes the effect of some of the investments made in the period, such as Lampenwelt and Cirtec, which were in higher rated sectors.",909
18511,"2017m11","As a result, the weighted average has increased from 9.",909
18511,"2017m11","9x post discount at March to 10.",909
18511,"2017m11","Turning then to our Infrastructure business.",909
18511,"2017m11","Just to remind you, the significant majority of our investment return currently comes from our 34% investment in 3iN, which announced its results last week.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our team have also raised 2 new funds, the 3i Managed Infrastructure Acquisitions fund and the 3i European Operations Projects fund.",909
18511,"2017m11","So far, these funds have added GBP 830 million to our assets under management, and we have committed GBP 69 million to those funds.",909
18511,"2017m11","And as you've just heard, our U.",909
18511,"2017m11","Infrastructure team have announced their first new investment since the period end.",909
18511,"2017m11","Of course, these new initiatives don't have a material impact on the numbers for our Infrastructure business in the first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","So the gross investment return of GBP 32 million comes mainly from the good share price performance of 3iN, together with its dividend income and the fee income from our associated advisory agreement.",909
18511,"2017m11","This income means our Infrastructure business is already a good contributor to operating cash income.",909
18511,"2017m11","As expected, our cash costs exceeded our cash income by GBP 16 million in the first half because we no longer have the income from the Debt Management business.",909
18511,"2017m11","But that measure will also be improved by Infrastructure's fundraising initiatives.",909
18511,"2017m11","So this has been a good half for 3iN in terms of performance but, importantly, also in terms of investment.",909
18511,"2017m11","We were net investors in the period as we saw a good number of attractive investments opportunities.",909
18511,"2017m11","In total, we've invested GBP 572 million, all funded from our strong balance sheet, and we realized GBP 374 million from Private Equity and from the residual Debt Management business.",909
18511,"2017m11","We started the year with net cash of GBP 419 million and liquidity of GBP 1.",909
18511,"2017m11","After the investment and realization activity that we've been talking about, and paying the final dividend, we have net debt of GBP 48 million and liquidity of GBP 877 million at the 30th of September.",909
18511,"2017m11","Looking forward to the remainder of the year, and of course subject to the usual caveats about market conditions, with a strong pipeline of realizations, we expect the profile of investments and realizations to reverse in the second half compared to the first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","We'll also be paying our interim dividend in the second half.",909
18511,"2017m11","So to remind you about our dividend policy, we pay a base dividend of 16p, half of which is paid as an interim and half as a final.",909
18511,"2017m11","We'll also pay an additional dividend with the final.",909
18511,"2017m11","We set the amount of that additional dividend by taking account of our outlook for investments and realizations and the strength of our balance sheet.",909
18511,"2017m11","You'll be familiar with this slide, which shows that distributions to shareholders are a fundamental part of our capital allocation model.",909
18511,"2017m11","So our portfolio continues to perform well, and we've made some excellent new investments, which means we are well positioned to deliver continued growth.",909
18511,"2017m11","Thank you, and we'll now take questions.",909
18511,"2017m11","Okay, why don't I deal with the first one, and Julia can deal with the second one on carry.",909
18511,"2017m11","I mean the portfolio has a number of different characteristics about it.",909
18511,"2017m11","So you've got the big beast Action, which really is still by far and away the most significant investment.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that's all about managing a growth agenda.",909
18511,"2017m11","It is a car driving at 100 miles an hour, and ensuring that the rest of the operation can keep up with our remarkable store opening teams.",909
18511,"2017m11","We are now up to opening 16 stores a week in the busy period of Action.",909
18511,"2017m11","And as you can imagine, these stores are not small stores.",909
18511,"2017m11","They put a lot of pressure on the rest of the system.",909
18511,"2017m11","You need to feed the store opening beast.",909
18511,"2017m11","So that is all operational agenda, and it's about getting your investment in front of your store opening program.",909
18511,"2017m11","So that's the critical challenge there, and that takes up a great deal of that management time as well as our own time.",909
18511,"2017m11","We have quite a number of our own executives focused on supporting Action.",909
18511,"2017m11","You've then got some very stable businesses that are much more focused on a growth agenda, and that can be both organic and it can be M&A.",909
18511,"2017m11","And I would say a big theme that you will see this year is consistent levels of M&A coming out of what I call our platform assets.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we're picking that back up again because the businesses are growing strongly and they now have the market positions and are confident enough to step out and make some important M&A.",909
18511,"2017m11","So significant value adds and synergies coming off that.",909
18511,"2017m11","You saw the Degania acquisition for Q.",909
18511,"2017m11","We talked about that in September.",909
18511,"2017m11","This Ponroy acquisition is a very important one.",909
18511,"2017m11","And there are others in the pipeline that we're pretty advanced on at this point.",909
18511,"2017m11","And then the third category is some of the stuff we buy off market is stuff that hasn't been made ready for a sale to a private equity party, so there's quite a bit of work left in it.",909
18511,"2017m11","And Schlemmer is the classic example of that.",909
18511,"2017m11","And so we'll often find with stuff like that, the trade off with getting it at a better price than if it had been ready to be sold through a bank auction is that we have to asset manage that company quite intensively for the first couple of years.",909
18511,"2017m11","We have to reorganize.",909
18511,"2017m11","We very often replace the CFO quite quickly.",909
18511,"2017m11","We might make bigger executive changes even then that, once we get within the business.",909
18511,"2017m11","But there's a part of the portfolio that represents that type of asset.",909
18511,"2017m11","And again, that represents considerable upside over time, but it takes a bit of a while to get your hands around the problems and get the company moving forward in the way you'd like.",909
18511,"2017m11","So there's a nice blend of different challenges in the portfolio, and it's what makes it stimulating for the investment teams and for the Investment Committee to sit above all of this.",909
18511,"2017m11","Good morning.",909
18511,"2017m11","Welcome to 3i's results presentation.",909
18511,"2017m11","It's been another strong half for 3i, with our strategy driving good levels of activity and solid returns.",909
18511,"2017m11","We took another good step forward in portfolio performance, and we sold assets at decent uplifts.",909
18511,"2017m11","And our Private Equity team made significant new investments like Hans Anders in Holland and Formel D in Germany.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we had a strong fundraising performance in Infrastructure.",909
18511,"2017m11","This has delivered another strong financial result with a total return of 11% in the half.",909
18511,"2017m11","This table throws up an interesting perspective not only against the restructuring baseline in 2012, but this 6-month return equals our full year return in 2015, underlying the strong, consistent year-on-year value growth of our portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we've entered the second half of the year with good momentum across both divisions.",909
18511,"2017m11","Again, the portfolio has performed well this year, but I'm also glad to see a good level of new investment in Private Equity.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our Private Equity team has delivered an excellent return, with a GIR of 15%.",909
18511,"2017m11","91% of our top 20 assets grew their earnings in the first half, and that's another good indication of the quality of our portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we made over GBP 0.",909
18511,"2017m11","5 billion of new investments, as well as doing some significant bolt-on acquisitions.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our portfolio has performed well and delivered decent growth across-the-board with very few write-downs.",909
18511,"2017m11","Apart from Action, the strongest growth has come from those companies we've invested in since our restructuring.",909
18511,"2017m11","And that relatively young 2013-16 portfolio has already delivered 1.",909
18511,"2017m11","9x costs in value growth so far.",909
18511,"2017m11","Action continues to perform strongly.",909
18511,"2017m11","For financial reporting, Action uses 13 periods, or 4 weeks, and the numbers in our interims are taken from their period 9, which finished on the 10th of September.",909
18511,"2017m11","Action had opened 111 new stores by that date and is on track to open more than 230 stores by the end of 2017.",909
18511,"2017m11","As of yesterday, Action had opened 192 stores and now has a total of 1,044.",909
18511,"2017m11","So that's a significant step up from last year and a major ramp up in this quarter in particular.",909
18511,"2017m11","That's an ambitious growth initiative, and even after significant levels of new investment in stores, distribution centers, country offices and central functions, like for likes and cash flow remain very strong.",909
18511,"2017m11","Without increasing Action's multiple, we've seen GBP 0.",909
18511,"2017m11","5 billion of value growth in the last 12 months alone.",909
18511,"2017m11","And the major store expansion program in this final quarter will create further significant momentum for 3i's second half valuation.",909
18511,"2017m11","We've produced a marked step-up in our origination activity this year.",909
18511,"2017m11","Origination has always been a great strength of 3i.",909
18511,"2017m11","The group led the PE Sector in establishing a European network of offices in the '80s and '90s.",909
18511,"2017m11","And now that we have dealt with most of our legacy issues, our investment teams have been freed up to focus on origination against some tight and carefully considered criteria.",909
18511,"2017m11","That change of focus means a good share of our recent investments have been sourced directly, away from competitive bank-driven auction processes.",909
18511,"2017m11","This chart puts this year's activity in context.",909
18511,"2017m11","We've invested about GBP 2 billion of capital since our restructuring, but half of that GBP 2 billion has been invested over the last 15 months alone.",909
18511,"2017m11","In addition, we enter the second half with a strong pipeline of new and follow-on investment activity.",909
18511,"2017m11","I'd now like to touch on a couple of our recent investments.",909
18511,"2017m11","Cirtec was our most recent investment.",909
18511,"2017m11","Like Q Holding's, it operates in the medical device sector, and like Q, Cirtec is capable of being a platform asset that will combine strong levels of organic growth with M&A.",909
18511,"2017m11","3i's international credentials were particularly useful in convincing the CEO that we were the right partner for his ambitious plans.",909
18511,"2017m11","I'm very excited about our investment in Lampenwelt, which is the largest specialty online retailer of lighting products in Europe.",909
18511,"2017m11","The business was started in Germany in 2004 by 2 brothers, who were both electrical engineers.",909
18511,"2017m11","Lampenwelt is a classic online disruptive retailer.",909
18511,"2017m11","It already operates in 14 European markets and is planning to selectively expand its geographic footprint further across Europe.",909
18511,"2017m11","We spotted the business when we were doing a due diligence scan of the sector as part of our review last year of the sale of SLV, another lighting company.",909
18511,"2017m11","One of our German network contacts knew the company and was able to make an introduction that led directly to an entirely off-market transaction.",909
18511,"2017m11","Lampenwelt is already highly profitable and generates lots of cash.",909
18511,"2017m11","So I have little doubt that it will become one of our highest growing companies very quickly.",909
18511,"2017m11","As I said a minute ago, we're also seeing a good level of bolt-on activity across the portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","Ponroy has the potential to become another important platform asset for 3i.",909
18511,"2017m11","And ERSA is another important step on that journey.",909
18511,"2017m11","Now I'd like to turn to the portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","We've raised GBP 350 million at 2.",909
18511,"2017m11","7x cost on realizations in the first half.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we move into the second half with a number of important processes in train.",909
18511,"2017m11","As long as markets remain resilient, we expect to raise significantly more cash from refinancings and realizations in the second half.",909
18511,"2017m11","Here's the investment bucket slide that we've been showing you for the last few years.",909
18511,"2017m11","And as you can see, the top 2 buckets continue to dominate the makeup of the portfolio.",909
18511,"2017m11","Basic-Fit continues to grow strongly as a public company, and Refresco is now subject to a take private bid from PAI.",909
18511,"2017m11","Now what about Infrastructure? They produced another good half, with a strong performance from 3iN, good levels of cash income for the group and a number of important new fund initiatives.",909
18511,"2017m11","The 3iN portfolio, with its recent core plus additions, is performing strongly, and several of its larger core assets are now undergoing strategic reviews.",909
18511,"2017m11","The return for 3i's shareholders on the 3iN June 2006 equity placing is now at a very respectable 22%.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we've made our first move into U.",909
18511,"2017m11","Infrastructure with the announcement of our acquisition of Smarte Carte.",909
18511,"2017m11","Smarte Carte is the leading provider of airport baggage carts and self-storage lockers across the U.",909
18511,"2017m11","Infra team is already performing well, and they are coming up with a good flow of interesting investment ideas.",909
18511,"2017m11","We intend to fund Infrastructure investments in the U.",909
18511,"2017m11","initially from our own balance sheet, with a view to deploying third-party capital in due course.",909
18511,"2017m11","So another good half for 3i, with the Private Equity and the Infrastructure teams producing good levels of alpha in their respective sectors, as well as significant income for the group from Infrastructure.",909
18511,"2017m11","Today, our portfolios are producing excellent returns, and we now have only a small number of underperformers.",909
18511,"2017m11","Importantly, the macro-economic environment across our chosen geographies and sectors is better than it has been for some time, even if the politics remains very, very tricky.",909
18511,"2017m11","Technology advances and globalization are both having a greater and greater impact on every commercial sector, and we remain very focused on buying companies that can thrive in this fast-changing environment.",909
18511,"2017m11","Without that competitive edge or resilience, companies across many different sectors are facing formidable and accelerating challenges.",909
18511,"2017m11","So testing a company's readiness for the -- for and resilience in the face of rapid digital change is an essential part of our pre-investment reviews.",909
18511,"2017m11","Our teams are energized about what they are doing.",909
18511,"2017m11","And they are setting high standards in international mid-market investing.",909
18511,"2017m11","And we are already benefiting from consistent investment processes and discipline.",909
18511,"2017m11","In fact, I am really struck by how much simpler we have made our business and our investment portfolio and how much more straightforward it is to focus and set the right priorities across the group.",909
18511,"2017m11","We enter the second half with good earnings momentum and a good pipeline of new investments and business initiatives.",909
18511,"2017m11","On our current portfolio, it looks like it should generate returns significantly better than our 2x target.",909
18511,"2017m11","I'll now pass over to Julia.",909
18511,"2017m5","Philip? We look at a variety of things.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You know that automotive often features prominently.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think I mentioned disruptive retailing is another sector we're looking very closely at.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've had a bit of a leaner time on, if you like, b2B businesses like we're looking harder a number of those, just 1 or 2 interesting opportunities in the space.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I don't know if they will happen, but we're certainly looking at a bunch of things.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So it's the same themes that we're planning to do.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's no change in that.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Do you have a question? I mean, yes, you're right, we did signal -- I mean, about this time last year, we had quite a lot of lower growth in the portfolio ex Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think at that time, that was particularly the impact of some of the weaker assets that we've talked about previously, so the Dynatects of this world and some of that the retailers.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But what we're seeing now in the portfolio ex Action is the benefit of the new investments that we've done coming through their first phase of ownership and starting to really flow through into the earnings growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So we've talked -- I'm not going to name all of the companies that are in the different bars, but we've talked about the good earnings growth that we've seen in the likes Audley with a strong U.",1048
18511,"2017m5","performance but also a growing U.",1048
18511,"2017m5","For example, ATESTEO, you've seen some refinancing this year, so that's also performing strongly.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So for the average ex Action is always going to go up and down a little bit, especially when you got a smaller number of companies, so it's going to be very -- it's [indiscernible] to what's happening in a particular period.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But I think what we're trying to show today is our confidence in the portfolio, ex Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And then clearly, we have this fantastic asset on top of that as well.",1048
18511,"2017m5","On the multiple, I mean, we're content where we are in the valuation today.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I said, we're trying to balance a number of factors, but we continue to keep it under review.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The business is obviously performing extremely well.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And you saw from the slide that Simon put up the potential for future growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So I wouldn't view the 16 as fixed, but I wouldn't want to try and formula in some sort of rate of improvement or increase in that.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think if you step back and looked at the information that we have, what's occurred really is this year was a very busy year in terms of realizations early on.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So a lot of that realization occurred in the first half.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And it's tidied, up on top of the previous 4 years, the portfolio considerably.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And therefore, what we're seeing is our teams devoting much, much more of their time to origination.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And therefore, the wheat bucket, as we call it, being much fuller.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the ability for us to look across quite a good population of assets and to determine the ones that which we wish to pursue and that's not only about the investment thesis in the business but how we think we'll do in competition with others if there is competition and whether ultimately, we'll be able to buy the price that we're comfortable with.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So there's quite a lot of judgments to how you managed that whip down.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But it's really starting from the fact that the smaller more manageable portfolio that has got less things going wrong a bit, we can spend a lot more time originating, and therefore, we're getting into a better rhythm in terms of investments, and it gives us the position to make choices over what we do, which is very important.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Chris? Well, I mean, we consider that position carefully.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We debate it within the Investment Committee.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We debate it within the board.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There are some voices that said if we could have 100% of our assets in Action, we should.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And there are others who are more cautious about the waiting.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But I think we're a long way from where we'll be uncomfortable with how much we are on Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The other question I had was on, what industries you're looking at in terms of foreign investments? Any particular thing that sort of any industrial subsector that pops to mind? There is an opportunity to extend that with the agreements with the LPs for another year, so till the end of '19.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We obviously haven't come to an agreement to that yet, but that's an important decision for the next year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Adedapo Oguntade from Morgan Stanley.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Just 3 questions here.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So one, in terms of your investment for FY '18, it's close to EUR 500 million now.",1048
18511,"2017m5","What's your guidance but he much for the rest of the year? So you're also looking at European assets.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It's down to 37 assets at the [indiscernible] moment by moment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The last few years, you've had a situation of pretty much net realizations of your investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Going forward, what should we expect? And then the last question, this comes to Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Given your long-term growth potential in Action and the earnings performance, so whitespace available, do think it's going to be better to apply in this year? Yes.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I mean, you don't get absolute complete uniformity across store performance.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But in some of these new countries and certainly in parts of France, we experienced better store economics than we experienced in Holland.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And in certain parts of Germany, we experienced less good economics than we first experienced in Holland.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But we find that as the knowledge about Action and the brand becomes greater, as it has done very quickly in France because we've been able to open more source more quickly, the economics moved up to the Holland economics and even surpassed them.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we suspect the same will be true in Germany as the brand awareness builds up over time.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Austria is probably ahead of Holland, as another example to that mix in terms of store economics.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It's Philip Middleton from Merrill Lynch.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I wonder if you could say of the bit more about what you see happening in investments because if I were to criticize what you've been doing until fairly recently, the net investment rate is relatively slow compared to where it needed to be on a steady-state basis.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It seems to be kind of a more steady state now.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Is that something you think is sustainable as you redeploy stuff in that area? How do you see the investment landscape, the opportunities set? Just more generally, how do you feel about the sort of outtrade at the moment? Good morning, everyone.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Welcome to 3i's Results for the Year to 31st of March 2017.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As anticipated, and most of you will have seen, it's been another strong year for 3i with good results across-the-board, and we have a clear and consistent strategy.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So how did we do over the last 12 months? We closed the year with a 36% return on equity, an NAV of 604p and increased dividend of 26.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5p for the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Both Private Equity and Infrastructure performed well, with good levels of new investment and strong portfolio performances.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we completed the sale of our Debt Management division in March.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The sale simplifies the group and focuses our people and resources on 2 high-quality businesses.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Realizations for the year were very strong, with almost GBP 1 billion from Private Equity and a further GBP 270 million from the sale of Debt Management.",1048
18511,"2017m5","3i is now performing as it should, and the approach we've taken over the last 5 years has transformed the group on all key KPIs.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Today's results are built on the sound fundamentals that we have put in place, and the numbers don't tell the full story.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The portfolio value number is considerably larger, but just as importantly, our portfolio today is made up of a smaller set of stronger, cleaner companies with much better earnings and value momentum.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So I've broken my presentation down into 4 parts, with one part being Action, but I'd like to start with Private Equity.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We still have a dry powder issue in this sector, and it's even bigger today than this time last year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Most of this dry powder is in the mega funds, but those of us in the midmarket still have to maintain the discipline we have demonstrated over the last 5 years.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we've got to continue looking for opportunities away from broad-based options as we successfully did this year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our PE team had a great year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","They delivered a 43% return, a good level of exciting new investments as well as GBP 1 billion of realizations.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So a good harvest, but some quality seed sown for the future.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Earnings and value growth have both accelerated across our Private Equity portfolio, with our larger Bucket 1 investments continuing to make a major contribution.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The performance from our 1316 vintage has been particularly strong, and we have seen much less value reduction this year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our 1316 vintage is still a relatively immature portfolio, and yet it kicked in at 29% return for the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Of course, there are 1 or 2 weak spots, but in general, we have seen really solid growth right across the portfolio.",1048
18511,"2017m5","At the interims, I mentioned the problems of Agent Provocateur where accounting irregularities had concealed the true financial position of the company and its lack of liquidity.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you know, we were not able to sort out the problems, and the company went into an administration process in March.",1048
18511,"2017m5","This resulted in a GBP 49 million write-off for 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Moving on, our investments since 2013 are performing well, with the 1316 vintage already at 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the new investments of the last 12 months, BoConcept, Schlemmer, Ponroy Santé are already making a promising contribution.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The investments we've made since financial year '13, including the ones we've recently announced, now total about GBP 2 billion.",1048
18511,"2017m5","These new assets will underpin significant gains going forward, especially if we beat our minimum 2x target.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we've entered this year with strong new investment momentum with the purchase of Lampenwelt, Hans Anders and Formel D.",1048
18511,"2017m5","These 3 new investments are all in our sweet spot.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Two disruptive retailers and a B2B German service business focused on the automotive sector.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It's been another strong year of realizations and refinancings.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I said a minute ago, the makeup of our Private Equity portfolio has been transformed by careful purchases and by the sale of many of our weaker legacy assets.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We are now down to 37 companies.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That's a net reduction of close to 100 over that 5-year period, and Buckets 1 and 2 now account for 86% of total value.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That means that our investment teams are spending much more time on origination.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And rather than waiting for the next bank auction, they're approaching companies directly and initiating bilateral discussions.",1048
18511,"2017m5","This approach is leading to good quality new investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","In fact, both Ponroy and Lampenwelt are great examples of what I mean, and I'm quietly confident that they will be good assets for 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now what about Action? The company continues to surpass all normal expectations.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Action has really brought home to me the power of compounding.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Whether you look at sales, number of stores or EBITDA, the returns this company generates off a larger and larger base are exceptional.",1048
18511,"2017m5","When you combine all these positive factors with strong like-for-likes and sector-leading cash generation, you benefit from an outstanding returns on capital.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And I don't think we're anywhere near the peak for Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Although it's increasing the number of stores it opens every year, it is barely scratching the surface of how big it can become.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you can see from this chart, store densities in Holland suggest that there's considerable whitespace opportunity in just France and Germany alone, and that's before we even consider the Rest of Europe.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I've said before, an Action store appeals to customers wherever we have opened them.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Action is part of that very exclusive set of retailers that have one format that works across borders in different retail environments and is, therefore, are capable of achieving very significant scale.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now at 3i, we have a small but very brainy strategy team.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And when they're not helping Julia sell our debt business, I ask them to look at things for me.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Earlier this year, I asked them to think of themselves as specialist fund managers, focusing on retail stocks and to come up with a 5 or 6 stocks they would have in their top bucket.",1048
18511,"2017m5","After lots of late nights and too much coffee and chocolate, they came up with this analysis.",1048
18511,"2017m5","They have picked Inditex, Dollarama, Five Below, XXL and B&M, a real mix of shapes and sizes, but if you're holding this portfolio, you probably wouldn't be too concerned by the current challenges in the High Street.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you can see, these companies produce good metrics across all the important KPIs.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But the really interesting thing is, if you transpose Action's numbers onto this slide, you get a good perspective on the relative quality of the Action growth story.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And none of these 5 stocks has anything like the whitespace potential of Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I really enjoy being on the Action board.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It has a first-class executive team and a very wise Chairman in Adrian Bellamy.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Expansion on this scale produces its own type of challenges, which are really fascinating.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the board is very involved in helping management maintain these strong growth rates while trying to avoid any high-speed problems.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And by the way, the Action compounding effect I mentioned earlier is very material for 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Okay, enough about Action for today, except to say that I look forward to seeing you again at our day with Action management on the 30th of May.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now let's turn to Infrastructure, where the market backdrop is no different.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's significant dry powder and a lot of interest in this sector, which makes it all the more satisfying that our team delivered a very productive year, both expanding 3iN's portfolio and raising 2 new funds.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The team produces growing asset management income for the group as well as managing investment for 3iN, which in turn has produced very solid capital growth and dividends.",1048
18511,"2017m5","3iN is our main infrastructure investment vehicle, but we have added some discrete fund initiatives in order to capitalize on 3i's broader network and capabilities and to strengthen the overall team in Infrastructure.",1048
18511,"2017m5","These new initiatives are in their early stages, but we expect them to grow over time and build on the income contribution of Infrastructure to the group.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Apart from investing in our Infrastructure capability and adding selectively to our PE investment team, we're not considering any change in our strategic approach.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I said right at the beginning, we will remain focused on executing our simple strategy while maintaining a disciplined approach to new investment in those sectors and geographies that we know well.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We'll also make the most of our Proprietary Capital.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That way, we can run our key winners and act more quickly and decisively when this helps secure new investment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you know, this is one of my favorite slides and illustrates what a powerful and efficient cash machine 3i has become.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We're getting better at finding new investment opportunities at sensible prices, and we have established the right processes and portfolio to deliver plenty of cash to reinvest and to distribute to shareholders.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Today, we have proposed a material increased our additional dividend to reflect the strength of the group and the momentum we have in the business going forward.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Don't assume we'll keep up this level of increase every year, but we are a group that is certainly capable of very attractive cash distributions over time.",1048
18511,"2017m5","This is clearly a decent set of results, and I would like to thank each and every one at 3i for their contribution this year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Many of our people have experienced harsher times, but everybody has worked really hard to secure this type of performance.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But there is no complacency at 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We recognize that the macro is better but still finally balanced as well as there being potential for more political uncertainty.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our people see the value in our processes and discipline, and as a result, have become better at finding, assessing and managing investments, and I would say our teams are as good as any in their respective markets.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you come to expect, we remain very careful about the cost of our platform, and the Investment Committee maintains a fierce determination to resist those voices, encouraging us to pay more than a given business might be worth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So another decent year where our all-around performance should add to that body of evidence which will help investors properly assess 3i's longer-term potential.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I'll pass over to Julia.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So as you've heard from Simon, we've had an excellent year, the strong performance from both our Private Equity and Infrastructure businesses.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've been busy.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've generated GBP 1 billion of proceeds from Private Equity, had a robust contribution from Infrastructure and simplified the group with the successful sale of our Debt Management business.",1048
18511,"2017m5","All in all, we finished the year with a total return of 36% and an NAV per share of 604p.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you can see here, the biggest component of the 30% NAV increase was unrealized value growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Action accounted for 2/3 of the 138p, and we got strong contributions from our more recent investments that Simon has talked about.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That made up most of the rest.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The corresponding net carry payable of 16p includes the benefit of going through the hurdle on an accounting basis on Eurofund V.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I'll explain more about that in a minute.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We did have a tailwind from sterling's weakness of 30p, but our results are strong with or without that FX benefit.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Finally, the 24p of dividends is made up of last year's final dividend and this year's interim, so the 604p is before the final dividend of 18.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5p that we've announced today.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our Private Equity business had a great year, and they generated a gross investment return of GBP 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That's a 43% return on opening portfolio value, and I'll talk about the main drivers of that in a minute.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It was a very good year for realizations, with 12 full disposals and a number of refinancings and partial realizations, generating GBP 982 million of proceeds.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The uplift to sale of 5%, which excludes refinancings, reflects Mayborn and Amor being valued an imminent sale basis last year, along with the proceeds of quoted sales where we don't normally expect a material uplift.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Needless to say, the GBP 49 million loss on Agent Provocateur also affected this measure.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The closing Private Equity portfolio value was GBP 4,8 billion.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As well as the unrealized value growth, we made good progress on new investment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The GBP 478 million you can see here includes our new investments in Schlemmer, BoConcept and Ponroy Santé as well as the funding for our existing U.",1048
18511,"2017m5","investments, Q Holding, to make their own investments in Degania.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you've already heard, that unrealized value growth of GBP 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","3 billion is underpinned by strong earnings growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The earnings growth of our top 20 investments, which account for 91% of the Private Equity portfolio value, are shown here.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Of course, Action is part of the greater than 30% bar, but that bar also includes another 4 investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","17 of these 20 investments have positive earnings growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now before I get into the usual slide on valuations, I'd like to give you some more detail about what we've done to update Action's valuation methodology.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You've seen from Simon's presentation that we think there's still plenty of upside in our investment case.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That presents a problem, the so-called nice problem to have, when we think about how we arrive at the fair value of Action in our books today.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We have to balance Action's exceptional performance and execution, its potential for significant further growth and the inherent risk in continuing to execute at this velocity.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We moved our valuation basis to run rate earnings instead of the last 12 months, or LTM, in march 2013.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The relentless consistency of Action's still rollout gave us the confidence to effectively pro forma in 12 months of new stores opened in the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Until now, we've used the run rate earnings to the preceding quarter.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That means, for example, using earnings to the 31st of December for a 31st of March valuation.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Every year since we made the change, Action has outperformed expectations.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That doesn't mean we can go as far as moving the valuation to DCF basis that some people are talking about.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But to recognize our competence in the performance and execution, we're now using earnings that are as close to our period-end as we can.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That means we based this evaluation on Action's earnings to the end of March 2017.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Since the third-party interest in our investment in June last year when we stepped up our valuation to GBP 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5 billion, we have let the multiple fall as Action's earnings have grown.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now that we've had another year of excellent performance, we've had another look at the multiple, and we've set it to 16x post discount at the 31st of March.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As a result, Action's total value growth in the year was GBP 911 million.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And just over 3/4 of that was down to earnings growth, which is a large part of the GBP 827 million performance category for the whole portfolio, which you can see here.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Other material contributors to that performance category are ATESTEO, Euro-Diesel and Audley.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Excluding Action, there was a modest decline in the average multiples we used from 10.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We continue to apply our policy of adjusting multiples down relative to their concept if we think that markets have got ahead of our longer-term view.",1048
18511,"2017m5","14 out of 22 investments were adjusted that way.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The DCF category is dominated by our investment in Scandlines, and the increase that you can see here reflects our view that the competing fixed link will be delayed by another 2 years.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our strong portfolio performance is also reflected in our carry payable and receivable, which we calculate assuming that all investments were sold at their balance sheet value.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I mentioned at the half year, the excellent performance of Action and also Scandlines meant that Eurofund V went through the carrying receivable hurdle earlier this year, and that's almost all of the GBP 275 million that you can see here.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The carry payable of GBP 431 million is a product of the same excellent performance, and it also includes the accrual for the proportion of the carry receivable that will also be paid out to the participating investment teams.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now I always make the point that the carry accrued is only paid out when the hurdle has been met on a cash-to-cash basis and then only when cash proceeds are actually received.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We went through the cash hurdle on schemes covering our investments made in 2010, '11 and '12 as a result of the Amor disposal.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That's the main reason for the step-up in cash we paid out this year to GBP 127 million.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now it's clear that the excellent performance in Private Equity is the biggest contributor to our capital returns.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Infrastructure complements and diversifies that because they are the principal contributor to our income returns.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the steps we've taken to grow the Infrastructure business, which Simon has talked about, should enhance that contribution.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We reinforced our support for this business and our belief in our team's ability to originate and manage good investments in the sector by standing behind 3iN's capital raise in June.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We invested GBP 131 million to maintain our 34% shareholding in 3iN.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That was a sound decision.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We, our team, have already deployed the capital raise in 6 new investments, and 3iN's share price has increased by 15% since the capital raise.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As a result, 3iN had a very good year, and that's reflected in our GBP 87 million of gross investment return.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You can also see here that our Infrastructure business is a significant contributor to our recurring fee income and cash income.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I mentioned, the new initiatives 3i have announced should increase their contribution further.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And this is all the more important following our sale of the Debt Management business, which we completed on the 3rd of March 2017.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Selling that business will put pressure on our operating cash profit metric.",1048
18511,"2017m5","However, with the fundamental reshaping of the cost base, good progress in Private Equity and new initiatives in Infrastructure, we will keep it as a measure to reinforce our cost discipline.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That discipline remains relevant as we make incremental investment in new people in both Private Equity and Infrastructure to support investment activity and new initiatives.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Operating costs were GBP 117 million in the financial year 2017 without Debt Management.",1048
18511,"2017m5","GBP 63 million of this was incurred in the second half, and we expect our cost in financial year 2018 to be about double that second half expense.",1048
18511,"2017m5","In March, we took a further step in derisking the balance sheet with the repayment of our 331 million Eurobond.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Gross debt is now only GBP 575 million, with an annual interest cost of GBP 35 million, which is down by about GBP 15 million.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We closed the year with net cash of GBP 419 million, but as you know, most of this is now reserved for the recently announced investments in Lampenwelt, Hans Anders and Formel D.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Altogether, they account about EUR 500 million of investment, which is a good start to the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And with liquidity of GBP 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","3 billion, we are well-funded for this new investment and distributions to shareholders.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've announced a final dividend of 18.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5p, subject to shareholder approval.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5p is made up of the final base dividend of 8p and an additional dividend of 10.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That additional dividend takes account of the balance sheet strength, our outlook for realizations and investments and also recognizes that this has been an excellent year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So this has been another good year for 3i, and our results have been underpinned by strategic progress in reshaping the business, excellent performance from Private Equity and a very good year for the Infrastructure team.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Thank you, and we'll now take questions.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Charles Murphy, Panmure Gordon.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Eurofund V comes to an end at the end of -- technically at the end of 2018.",1048
18511,"2017m5","How does -- what opportunities are there for you to extend that the bit further? And how does that affect how you think about Action and Scandlines? Why don't I take the first 2, and Julia can come back to the third because she did touch on in her presentation.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I mean, we've had an unusually strong start I would say to the liquidity of investments it's a bit like catching a bus, and so we have signed quite a few deals in a short space of time.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's outlook the no guarantee that the rest of your will continue at that pace.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And I would expect it to moderate and for us to be more careful.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But I do think we will invest more money this year than we have previously and get closer to our sort of run rate of investment around GBP 700 million, GBP 750 million, if you like.",1048
18511,"2017m5","In terms of realizations, it's early in the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There are things moving forward, but I would again expect between realizations and refis, we'll get closer to our normal level, which is around the GBP 750 million, GBP 800 million type level if markets remain conducive to that.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's a number of things going through.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think of the order of about GBP 100 million is sort of coming in over the recent weeks.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It's that sort of things in smaller, smaller initiatives.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And there are 1 or 2 big things beginning to move along in terms of realizations.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Chris Brown from JPMorgan.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Just a quick question about post year-end events.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I mean, clearly, there's been a lot of investment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You've got the dividend to come out.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Has there been much realization since the 31st of March? Arun from Macquarie.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Can just I ask, you sort of have the map of Action and you sort of looked at the whitespaces.",1048
18511,"2017m5","What gives you so much confidence of the whitespace probably France and Germany's almost alike in terms of revenue potential? Or even if you extend that across Europe, what giving the whitespace or same in terms of property as you would see in sort of the Holland or the old places Action did so well? Perhaps you could also talk a little bit about how when the board is looking at Action and the fact it's 30% of NAV, how do you think about -- in terms sort of risk versus order of that situation? And then on the DCF, I said what we're trying to balance is fantastic performance to date, big potential for future growth, but also there's inherent risk in sort of rolling out the way they're doing the execution that we've got.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And for that reason, when we wouldn't move it to a DCF basis in our books.",1048
18511,"2017m5","DCF is a very good preference point, especially to the extent people get concerned about the multiple that we're applying, that gives a sort of confidence in how we're looking at that.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think what we try to do is to give you as much visibility of how we're valuing it.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So to give you all the components the multiple we use, you'll also find in the press release, we're giving you the sensitivities.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So 1 turn on the multiple will be GBP 135 million on our value, so you can measure it from that perspective.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But I think DCF is definitely got its place, and it's definitely good preference point.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But I don't imagine is moving to that method anytime soon.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",1048
18511,"2017m5","A couple of questions from me.",1048
18511,"2017m5","First is on earnings growth trajectory.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Julia, I think last year you sort of commented on experiencing a sort of trough in earnings growth profile and the expectation that it becoming resurgent from there.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You've got a slide where you're showing sort of, obviously the Action asset growing more than 30% but about GBP 650 million of value, also growing more than 30%.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So did you see that being sustained, the sort of improvement in earnings momentum? Can you give any color around those sort of 4 assets that you detailed as being in that sort of GBP 650 million? What are they? And what's the sort of sustainability there? Second question was around the multiple of Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","How -- it actually continues to grow more than 30% a year, how you think about the interplay between revaluing it up to 18x, again growing into the multiple or maintaining at 16x? We'll have Morgan Stanley do that for us.",1048
18511,"2017m5","If there are no more questions, thanks very much for coming.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Have a good day.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We'll have Morgan Stanley do that for us.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So as you've heard from Simon, we've had an excellent year with strong performance from both our Private Equity and Infrastructure businesses.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've been busy.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've generated GBP 1 billion of proceeds from Private Equity, had a robust contribution from Infrastructure and simplified the group with the successful sale of our Debt Management business.",1048
18511,"2017m5","All in all, we finished the year with a total return of 36% and an NAV per share of 604p.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you can see here, the biggest component of our -- of the 30% NAV increase was unrealized value growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Action accounted for 2/3 of the 138p.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we got strong contributions from our more recent investments that Simon has talked about.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That made up most of the rest.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The corresponding net carry payable of 16p includes the benefit of going through the hurdle on an accounting basis on Eurofund V.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I'll explain more about that in a minute.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We did have a tailwind from sterling's weakness of 30p, but our results are strong with or without that FX benefit.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Finally, the 24p of dividends is made up of last year's final dividend and this year's interim, so the 604p is before the final dividend of 18.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5p that we've announced today.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our Private Equity business had a great year, and they generated a gross investment return of GBP 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That's a 43% return on opening portfolio value, and I'll talk about the main drivers of that in a minute.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It was a very good year for realizations with 12 full disposals and a number of refinancings and partial realizations, generating GBP 982 million of proceeds.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The uplift to sale of 5%, which excludes refinancings, reflects Mayborn and Amor being valued on an imminent-sale basis last year, along with the proceeds of quoted sales where we don't normally expect a material uplift.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Needless to say the GBP 49 million loss on Agent Provocateur also affected this measure.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The closing Private Equity portfolio value was GBP 4.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As well as the unrealized value growth, we made good progress on new investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The GBP 478 million you can see here includes our new investments in Schlemmer, BoConcept and Ponroy Santé; as well as the funding for our existing U.",1048
18511,"2017m5","investment, Q Holding, to make them -- to make their own investment in Degania.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you've already heard, that unrealized value growth of GBP 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","3 billion is underpinned by strong earnings growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The earnings growth of our top 20 investments, which account for 91% of the Private Equity portfolio value, are shown here.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Of course, Action is part of the ""greater than 30%"" bar, but that bar also includes another 4 investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","17 of these 20 investments have positive earnings growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now before I get on to the usual slide on valuations, I'd like to give you some more detail about what we've done to update Action's valuation methodology.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You've seen from Simon's presentation that we think there's still plenty of upside in our investment case.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That presents a problem, a so-called nice problem to have, when we think about how we arrive at the fair value of Action in our books today.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We have to balance Action's exceptional performance and execution, its potential for significant further growth and the inherent risk in continuing to execute at this velocity.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We moved our valuation basis to run rate earnings instead of the last 12 months or LTM in March 2013.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The relentless consistency of Action store rollout gave us the confidence to effectively pro forma in 12 months of new stores opened in the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Until now, we've used the run rate earnings to the preceding quarter.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That means, for example, using earnings to the 31st of December for a 31st of March valuation.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Every year since we made the change, Action has outperformed expectations.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That doesn't mean we can go as far as moving the valuation to a DCF basis that some people are talking about, but to recognize our competence in the performance and execution, we're now using earnings that are as close to our period end as we can.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That means we based this evaluation on Action's earnings to the end of March 2017.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Since the third-party interest in our investment in June last year when we stepped up our valuation to GBP 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5 billion, we have let the multiple fall, as Action's earnings have grown.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now that we've had another year of excellent performance, we've had another look at the multiple, and we've set it to 16x post discount at the 31st of March.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As a result, Action's total value growth in the year was GBP 911 million.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And just over 3/4 of that was down to earnings growth, which is a large part of the GBP 827 million performance category for the whole portfolio, which you can see here.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Other material contributors to that performance category are ATESTEO, EURO-DIESEL and Audley.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Excluding Action, there was a modest decline in the average multiples we used from 10.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We continue to apply our policy of adjusting multiples down relative to their concepts if we think that markets have got ahead of our longer-term view.",1048
18511,"2017m5","14 out of 22 investments were adjusted that way.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The DCF category is dominated by our investment in Scandlines.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the increase that you can see here reflects our view that the competing fixed link will be delayed by another 2 years.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our strong portfolio performance is also reflected in our carry payable and receivable, which we calculate assuming that all investments were sold at their balance sheet value.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I mentioned at the half year, the excellent performance of Action and also Scandlines meant that Eurofund V went through the carry receivable hurdle earlier this year, and that's almost all of the GBP 275 million that you can see here.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The carry payable of GBP 431 million is a product of the same excellent performance.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And it also includes the accrual for the proportion of the carry receivable that will also be paid out to the participating investment teams.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I always make the point that the carry accrued is only paid out when the hurdle has been met on a cash-to-cash basis and then only when cash proceeds are actually received.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We went through the cash hurdle on schemes covering our investments made in 2010, '11 and '12 as a result of the Amor disposal.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That's the main reason for the step-up in cash we paid out this year to GBP 127 million.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now it's clear that the excellent performance from Private Equity is the biggest contributor to our capital returns.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Infrastructure complements and diversifies that because they are the principal contributor to our income returns.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the steps we've taken to grow the Infrastructure business, which Simon has talked about, should enhance that contribution.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We reinforced our support for this business and our belief in our team's ability to originate and manage good investments in the sector by standing behind 3iN's capital raise in June.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We invested GBP 131 million to maintain our 34% shareholding in 3iN.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That was a sound decision.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We -- our team have already deployed the capital raise in 6 new investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And 3iN's share price has increased by 15% since the capital raise.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As a result, 3iN had a very good year, and that's reflected in our GBP 87 million of gross investment return.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You can also see here that our Infrastructure business is a significant contributor to our recurring fee income and cash income.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I mentioned, the new initiatives we have announced should increase their contribution further.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And this is all the more important following our sale of the Debt Management business, which we completed on the 3rd of March 2017.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Selling that business will put pressure on our operating cash profit metric.",1048
18511,"2017m5","However, with the fundamental reshaping of the cost base, good progress in Private Equity and new initiatives in Infrastructure, we will keep it as a measure to reinforce our cost discipline.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That discipline remains relevant as we make incremental investments in new people in both Private Equity and Infrastructure to support investment activity and new initiatives.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Operating costs were GBP 117 million in the financial year 2017 without Debt Management.",1048
18511,"2017m5","GBP 63 million of this was incurred in the second half, and we expect our costs in financial year 2018 to be about double that second half expense.",1048
18511,"2017m5","In March, we took a further step in derisking the balance sheet with the repayment of our EUR 331 million bond.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Gross debt is now only GBP 575 million, with an annual interest cost of GBP 35 million which is down by about GBP 15 million.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We closed the year with net cash of GBP 419 million, but as you know, most of this is now reserved for the recently announced investments in Lampenwelt, Hans Anders and Formel D.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Altogether, they account for about EUR 500 million of investment, which is a good start to the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And with liquidity of GBP 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","3 billion, we are well funded for these new investments and distributions to shareholders.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've announced a final dividend of 18.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5p, subject to shareholder approval.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5p is made up of the final base dividend of 8p and an additional dividend of 10.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That additional dividend takes account of the balance sheet strength, our outlook for realizations and investments; and also recognizes that this has been an excellent year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So it has been another good year for 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And our results have been underpinned by strategic progress in reshaping the business, excellent performance from Private Equity and a very good year for the Infrastructure team.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Thank you, and we'll now take questions.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Good morning, everyone.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Welcome to 3i's results for the year till 31st of March 2017.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As anticipated and most of you will have seen, it's been another strong year for 3i with good results across-the-board, and we have a clear and consistent strategy.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So how did we do over the last 12 months? We closed the year with a 36% return on equity, an NAV of 604p and an increased dividend of 26.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5p for the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Both Private Equity and Infrastructure performed well with good levels of new investment and strong portfolio performances.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we completed the sale of our Debt Management division in March.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The sale simplifies the group and focuses our people and resources on 2 high-quality businesses.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Realizations for the year were very strong with almost GBP 1 billion from Private Equity and a further GBP 270 million from the sale of Debt Management.",1048
18511,"2017m5","3i is now performing as it should, and the approach we've taken over the last 5 years has transformed the group on all key KPIs.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Today's results are built on the sound fundamentals that we have put in place.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the numbers don't tell the full story: The portfolio value number is considerably larger, but just as importantly, our portfolio today is made up of a smaller set of stronger, cleaner companies with much better earnings and value momentum.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So I've broken my presentation down into 4 parts, with 1 part being Action, but I'd like to start with Private Equity.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We still have a dry powder issue in this sector, and it's even bigger today than this time last year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Most of this dry powder is in the mega funds, but those of us in the midmarket still have to maintain the discipline we have demonstrated over the last 5 years.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we've got to continue looking for opportunities away from broad-based auctions, as we successfully did this year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our PE team had a great year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","They delivered a 43% return; a good level of exciting, new investments; as well as GBP 1 billion of realizations, so a good harvest but some quality seed sown for the future.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Earnings and value growth have both accelerated across our Private Equity portfolio, with our larger Bucket 1 investments continuing to make a major contribution.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The performance from our '13, '16 vintage has been particularly strong, and we have seen much less value reduction this year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our '13, '16 vintage is still a relatively immature portfolio, and yet it kicked in a 29% return for the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Of course, there are 1 or 2 weak spots, but in general we have seen really solid growth right across the portfolio.",1048
18511,"2017m5","At the interims, I mentioned the problems of Agent Provocateur, where accounting irregularities had concealed the true financial position of the company and its lack of liquidity.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you know, we were not able to sort out the problems, and the company went into an administration process in March.",1048
18511,"2017m5","This resulted in a GBP 49 million write-off for 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Moving on, our investments since 2013 are performing well, with the '13, '16 vintage already at 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the new investments of the last 12 months, BoConcept, Schlemmer, Ponroy Santé, are already making a promising contribution.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The investments we've made since financial year '13, including the ones we've recently announced, now total about GBP 2 billion.",1048
18511,"2017m5","These new assets will underpin significant gains going forward, especially if we beat our minimum 2x target.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we've entered this year with strong new investment momentum with the purchase of Lampenwelt, Hans Anders and Formel D.",1048
18511,"2017m5","These 3 new investments are all in our sweet spot: 2 disruptive retailers and a B2B German service business focused on the automotive sector.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It's been another strong year of realizations and refinancings.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I said a minute ago, the makeup of our Private Equity portfolio has been transformed by careful purchases and by the sale of many of our weaker legacy assets.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We are now down to 37 companies.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That's a net reduction of close to 100 over that 5-year period.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And Buckets 1 and 2 now account for 86% of total value.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That means that our investment teams are spending much more time on origination, and rather than waiting for the next bank auction, they're approaching companies directly and initiating bilateral discussions.",1048
18511,"2017m5","This approach is leading to good-quality, new investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","In fact, both Ponroy and Lampenwelt are great examples of what I mean, and I'm quietly confident that they will both be strong assets for 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now what about Action? The company continues to surpass all normal expectations.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Action has really brought home to me the power of compounding.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Whether you look at sales, number of stores or EBITDA, the returns this company generates off a larger and larger base are exceptional.",1048
18511,"2017m5","When you combine all these positive factors with strong like-for-likes and sector-leading cash generation, you benefit from an outstanding returns on capital.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And I don't think we're anywhere near the peak for Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Although it's increasing the number of stores it opens every year, it is barely scratching the surface of how big it can become.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you can see from this chart, store densities in Holland suggest that there is considerable white space opportunity in just France and Germany alone, and that's before we even consider the rest of Europe.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I have said before, an Action store appeals to customers wherever we have opened them.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Action is part of that very exclusive set of retailers that have one format that works across borders in different retail environments and is therefore capable of achieving very significant scale.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now at 3i we have a small but very brainy strategy team.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And when they're not helping Julia sell our debt business, I ask them to look at things for me.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Earlier this year, I asked them to think of themselves as specialist fund managers focusing on retail stocks and to come up with the 5 or 6 stocks they would have in their top bucket.",1048
18511,"2017m5","After lots of late nights and too much coffee and chocolate, they came up with this analysis.",1048
18511,"2017m5","They have picked Inditex, Dollarama, Five Below, XXL and B&M, a real mix of shapes and sizes, but if you're holding this portfolio, you probably wouldn't be too concerned by the current challenges in the high street.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you can see, these companies produce good metrics across all the important KPIs, but the really interesting thing is, if you transpose Action's numbers onto this slide, you get a good perspective on the relative quality of the Action growth story.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And none of these 5 stocks has anything like the white space potential of Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I really enjoy being on the Action board.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It has a first-class executive team and a very wise Chairman in Adrian Bellamy.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Expansion on this scale produces its own type of challenges which are really fascinating, and the board is very involved in helping management maintain these strong growth rates while trying to avoid any high-speed problems.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And by the way, the Action compounding effect I mentioned earlier is very material for 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Okay, enough about Action for today, except to say that I look forward to seeing you again at our day with Action management on the 30th of May.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now let's turn to Infrastructure, where the market backdrop is no different.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's significant dry powder and a lot of interest in this sector, which makes it all the more satisfying that our team delivered a very productive year both expanding 3iN's portfolio and raising 2 new funds.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The team produces growing asset management income for the group, as well as managing investment for 3iN, which in turn has produced very solid capital growth and dividends.",1048
18511,"2017m5","3iN is our main Infrastructure investment vehicle, but we have added some discrete fund initiatives in order to capitalize on 3i's broader network and capabilities and to strengthen the overall team in Infrastructure.",1048
18511,"2017m5","These new initiatives are in their early stages, but we expect them to grow over time and build on the income contribution of Infrastructure to the group.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Apart from investing in our Infrastructure capability and adding selectively to our PE investment team, we're not considering any change in our strategic approach.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I said right at the beginning, we will remain focused on executing our simple strategy while maintaining a disciplined approach to new investment in those sectors and geographies that we know well.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We will also make the most of our proprietary capital.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That way, we can run our key winners and act more quickly and decisively when this helps secure new investment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you know, this is one of my favorite slides and illustrates what a powerful and efficient cash machine 3i has become.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We're getting better at finding new investment opportunities at sensible prices, and we have established the right processes and portfolio to deliver plenty of cash to reinvest and to distribute to shareholders.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Today, we have proposed a material increase to our additional dividend to reflect the strength of the group and the momentum we have in the business going forward.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Don't assume we'll keep up this level of increase every year, but we are a group that is certainly capable of very attractive cash distributions over time.",1048
18511,"2017m5","This is clearly a decent set of results, and I would like to thank each and every one at 3i for their contribution this year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Many of our people have experienced harsher times, but everybody has worked really hard to secure this type of performance.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But there is no complacency at 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We recognize that the macro is better but still finely balanced as well as there being potential for more political uncertainty.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our people see the value in our processes and discipline and, as a result, have become better at finding, assessing and managing investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And I would say our teams are as good as any in their respective markets.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you come to expect, we remain very careful about the costs of our platform.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the Investment Committee remain -- maintains a fierce determination to resist those voices encouraging us to pay more than a given business might be worth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So another decent year where our all-around performance should add to that body of evidence which will help investors properly assess 3i's longer-term potential.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I'll pass over to Julia.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There is an opportunity to extend that with the agreements with the LPs for another year, so till the end of '19.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We obviously haven't come to any view about that yet, but that's an important decision for next year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","[ That's right ].",1048
18511,"2017m5","I mean, yes, you're right.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We did signal that -- well, I mean this -- by about this time last year, we had quite a lot lower growth in the portfolio ex Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think, at that time, that was particularly the impact of some of the weaker assets that we've talked about previously, so the Dynatects of this world and some of the retailers.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But what we're seeing now in the portfolio ex Action is the benefit of the new investments that we've done coming through their first phase of ownership and starting to really flow through into the earnings growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So we've talked -- I'm not going to name all of the companies that are in the different bars, but we've talked about the good earnings growth that we se in the likes of Audley with a strong U.",1048
18511,"2017m5","performance but also a growing U.",1048
18511,"2017m5","For example, ATESTEO, you've seen, has done a refinancing this year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So that's also performing strongly.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So the average ex Action is always going to go up and down a little bit, especially when you've got a smaller number of companies.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So it's going to be very idiosyncratic to what's happening in a particular period, but I think what we're trying to show today is our confidence in the portfolio ex Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And then clearly, we have this fantastic asset on top of that as well.",1048
18511,"2017m5","On the multiple, I mean, we're content where we are in the valuation today.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I said, we're trying to balance a number of factors, but we continue to keep it under review.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The business is obviously performing extremely well.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And you saw from the slide that Simon put up the potential for future growth, so I wouldn't view the 16x as fixed, but I wouldn't try and formula in some sort of rate of improvement or increase in that.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Chris Brown from JPMorgan.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Just a quick question about post-year-end events.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I mean clearly there's been a lot of investment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You've got a dividend to come out.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Has there been much from the realization front since 31st of March? Okay, if there are no more questions.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Thanks very much for coming.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Have a good day.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The other question I had was on what industries you're looking at in terms of forward investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Any particular thing that sort of -- industrial subsector that pops to mind? And then on the DCF, I said what we're trying to balance is fantastic performance to date, big potential for future growth, but also there is inherent risk in sort of rolling out in the way they're doing and the execution that we've got.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And for that reason, we wouldn't move it to a DCF basis in our books.",1048
18511,"2017m5","DCF is a very good reference point, especially to the extent people get concerned about the multiple that we're applying.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That gives us sort of confidence in how we're looking at that.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think what we try to do is to give you as much visibility of how we're valuing it.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So to give you all of the components: The multiple we use, you will also find in the press release.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've given you a sensitivity.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So one turn on the multiple would be GBP 135 million on our value.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And so you can measure it from that perspective, but I think DCF has definitely got its place.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And it's definitely a good reference point, but I don't imagine us moving to that method anytime soon.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Philip? There's a number of things going through.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think of the order of about GBP 100 million is sort of coming in over the recent weeks.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It's that sort of thing in smaller initiatives.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And there are 1 or 2 big things beginning to move along in terms of realizations.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Adedapo Oguntade from Morgan Stanley.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Just 3 questions here.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So one, in terms of your investment for FY '18, it is very close to EUR 500 million.",1048
18511,"2017m5","What's your guidance [indiscernible] for the rest of the year? Two, also looking at your PE assets, it is down to 37 assets and 3 quoted holdings at any -- at the moment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The last few years, you've had a situation of net -- pretty much net realizations -- or realizations have been up of your investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Going forward, what should we expect? And then the last question, this comes to Action: Given your long-term growth potential in Action and the earnings performance as well as the enormous white space available in Europe, do you think it will be better to apply this year? [indiscernible].",1048
18511,"2017m5","Arun Melmane, Macquarie.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Can just I ask? You sort of had a map of Action, and you sort of looked at the white spaces.",1048
18511,"2017m5","What gives you so much confidence that the white space in probably France and Germany is almost alike in terms of revenue potential? Or even if you extend that across Europe, why do you think the white spaces are same in terms of property as you would see in sort of the Holland or the old places that Action did so well in? We look at a variety of things.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You know that automotive often features prominently.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think I mentioned disruptive retailing is another sector we're looking very closely at.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've had a bit of a leaner time on, if you like, B2B businesses like [indiscernible].",1048
18511,"2017m5","We're looking harder at a number of those.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's 1 or 2 interesting opportunities in the states.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I don't know if they will happen, but we're certainly looking at a bunch of things.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So it's the same themes that we're planning to do.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's no change in that.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Do you have a question? And perhaps you could also talk a little bit about how -- when the board is looking at Action and the fact it was 30% of NAV, how do you think about in terms of the sort of risk versus reward of that situation? Well, I mean, we consider that position carefully.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We debate it within the Investment Committee.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We debate it within the board.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There are some voices that said, if we could have 100% of our assets in Action, we should.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And there are others who are more cautious about the weighting, but I think we're a long way from where we'll be uncomfortable with how much we own of Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Charles Murphy, Panmure Gordon.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Eurofund V comes to an end at the end of -- potentially it comes to the end at the end of 2018.",1048
18511,"2017m5","How does -- what opportunities are there for you to extend that a bit further? And how does that affect how you think about Action and Scandlines? I think, if you step back and look at the information that we have, what's occurred really is this year was a very busy year in terms of realizations early on.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So a lot of that realization occurred in the first half.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And it's tidied up, on top of the previous 4 years, the portfolio considerably.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And therefore, what we're seeing is our teams devoting much, much more of their time to origination and therefore the [ WIP ] bucket, as we call it, being much fuller; and the ability for us to look across quite a good population of assets and to determine the ones that -- which we wish to pursue.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And that's not only about the investment thesis in the business but how we think we'll do in competition with others if there is competition and whether ultimately we'll be able to buy it at a price that we're comfortable with.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So there's quite a lot of judgments into how you manage that [ WIP ] down.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But it's really starting from the fact that, with a smaller, more manageable portfolio that has got less things going wrong with it, we can spend a lot more time originating.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And therefore, we're getting into a better rhythm in terms of investments, and it gives us the position to make choices over what we do, which is very important.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Chris? Why don't I take the first two? And Julia can come back to the third because she did touch on it in her presentation.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I mean we've had an unusually strong start, I would say, to the rapidity of investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And it's a bit like catching a bus, isn't it? And so we have signed quite a few deals in a short space of time.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's absolutely no guarantee that the rest of the year will continue at that pace.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And I would expect it to moderate and for us to be more careful, but I do think we will invest more money this year than we have previously; and get closer to our sort of run rate of investment of around GBP 700 million, GBP 750 million, if you like.",1048
18511,"2017m5","In terms of realizations, it's early in the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There are things moving forward, but I would again expect, between realizations and refis, we'll get closer to our normal level which is around the GBP 750 million, GBP 800 million type level if markets remain conducive to that.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I mean you don't get absolute complete uniformity across store performance, but in some of these new countries and certainly in parts of France, we experienced better store economics than we experienced in Holland.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And in certain parts of Germany, we experienced less-good economics than we -- per store than we experienced in Holland.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But we find that, as the knowledge about Action and the brand becomes greater, as it has done very quickly in France because we've been able to open more stores more quickly, the economics move up to the Holland economics and even surpass them.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we suspect the same will be true in Germany as the brand awareness builds up over time.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Austria is probably ahead of Holland, as another example to that mix in terms of store economics.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",1048
18511,"2017m5","A couple of questions from me.",1048
18511,"2017m5","First is on earnings growth trajectory.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Julia, I think, last year, you sort of commented on experiencing a sort of trough in earnings growth profile and your expectation of it becoming resurgent from there.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You've got a slide where you're showing sort of obviously the Action asset growing more than 30% but about GBP 650 million of value also growing more than 30%.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So did you see that being sustained, the sort of improvement in earnings momentum? Can you give any color around those sort of 4 assets that you detailed as being in that sort of GBP 650 million? What are they? And what's the sort of sustainability there? Second question was around the multiple of Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","How -- if Action continues to grow more than 30% a year, how do you think about the interplay between revaluing it up to 18x again, growing into the multiple; or maintaining at 16x? It's Philip Middleton from Merrill's.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Can you say a little bit more about what you see happening in investments? Because if I were to criticize what you've been doing until fairly recently, the net investment rate is relatively slow compared to where it needed to be on a steady-state basis.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It seems to be kind of more steady state now.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Is that something you think is sustainable as you redeploy stuff in that area? How do you see the investment landscape, the opportunity set? And just more generally, how do you feel about the sort of outtrade at the moment? Well, I mean, we consider that position carefully.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We debate it within the Investment Committee.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We debate it within the board.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There are some voices that said, if we could have 100% of our assets in Action, we should.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And there are others who are more cautious about the weighting.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But I think we're a long way from where we'll be uncomfortable with how much we own of Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Good morning, everyone.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Welcome to 3i's results for the year to 31st of March 2017.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As anticipated, and most of you will have seen, it's been another strong year for 3i with good results across-the-board, and we have a clear and consistent strategy.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So how did we do over the last 12 months? We closed the year with a 36% return on equity, an NAV of 604p and an increased dividend of 26.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5p for the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Both Private Equity and Infrastructure performed well, with good levels of new investment and strong portfolio performances.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we completed the sale of our Debt Management division in March.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The sale simplifies the group and focuses our people and resources on 2 high-quality businesses.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Realizations for the year were very strong with almost GBP 1 billion from Private Equity and a further GBP 270 million from the sale of Debt Management.",1048
18511,"2017m5","3i is now performing as it should, and the approach we've taken over the last 5 years has transformed the group on all key KPIs.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Today's results are built on the sound fundamentals that we have put in place.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the numbers don't tell the full story.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The portfolio value number is considerably larger, but just as importantly, our portfolio today is made up of a smaller set of stronger, cleaner companies with much better earnings and value momentum.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So I've broken my presentation down into 4 parts, with one part being Action, but I'd like to start with Private Equity.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We still have a dry powder issue in this sector, and it's even bigger today than this time last year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Most of this dry powder is in the mega funds, but those of us in the midmarket still have to maintain the discipline we have demonstrated over the last 5 years.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we've got to continue looking for opportunities away from broad-based auctions, as we successfully did this year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our PE team had a great year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","They delivered a 43% return; a good level of exciting, new investments; as well as GBP 1 billion of realizations, so a good harvest but some quality seed sown for the future.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Earnings and value growth have both accelerated across our Private Equity portfolio, with our larger bucket 1 investments continuing to make a major contribution.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The performance from our '13, '16 vintage has been particularly strong, and we have seen much less value reduction this year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our '13, '16 vintage is still a relatively immature portfolio, and yet it kicked in a 29% return for the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Of course, there are 1 or 2 weak spots, but in general we have seen really solid growth right across the portfolio.",1048
18511,"2017m5","At the interims, I mentioned the problems of Agent Provocateur, where accounting irregularities had concealed the true financial position of the company and its lack of liquidity.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you know, we were not able to sort out the problems, and the company went into an administration process in March.",1048
18511,"2017m5","This resulted in a GBP 49 million write-off for 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Moving on, our investments since 2013 are performing well, with the '13, '16 vintage already at 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the new investments of the last 12 months, BoConcept, Schlemmer, Ponroy Santé, are already making a promising contribution.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The investments we made since financial year '13, including the ones we've recently announced, now total about GBP 2 billion.",1048
18511,"2017m5","These new assets will underpin significant gains going forward, especially if we beat our minimum 2x target.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we've entered this year with strong new investment momentum with the purchase of Lampenwelt, Hans Anders and Formel D.",1048
18511,"2017m5","These 3 new investments are all in our sweet spot: 2 disruptive retailers and a B2B German service business focused on the automotive sector.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It's been another strong year of realizations and refinancings.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I said a minute ago, the makeup of our Private Equity portfolio has been transformed by careful purchases and by the sale of many of our weaker legacy assets.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We are now down to 37 companies.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That's a net reduction of close to 100 over that 5-year period.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And buckets 1 and 2 now account for 86% of total value.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That means that our investment teams are spending much more time on origination, and rather than waiting for the next bank auction, they're approaching companies directly and initiating bilateral discussions.",1048
18511,"2017m5","This approach is leading to good-quality, new investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","In fact, both Ponroy and Lampenwelt are great examples of what I mean, and I'm quietly confident that they will both be strong assets for 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now what about Action? The company continues to surpass all normal expectations.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Action has really brought home to me the power of compounding.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Whether you look at sales, number of stores or EBITDA, the returns this company generates off a larger and larger base are exceptional.",1048
18511,"2017m5","When you combine all these positive factors with strong like-for-likes and sector-leading cash generation, you benefit from an outstanding returns on capital.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And I don't think we're anywhere near the peak for Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Although it's increasing the number of stores it opens every year, it is barely scratching the surface of how big it can become.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you can see from this chart, store densities in Holland suggest that there is considerable white space opportunity in just France and Germany alone, and that's before we even consider the rest of Europe.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I have said before, an Action store appeals to customers wherever we have opened them.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Action is part of that very exclusive set of retailers that have one format that works across borders in different retail environments and is therefore capable of achieving very significant scale.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now at 3i we have a small but very brainy strategy team.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And when they're not helping Julia sell our Debt business, I ask them to look at things for me.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Earlier this year, I asked them to think of themselves as specialist fund managers, focusing on retail stocks, and to come up with the 5 or 6 stocks they would have in their top bucket.",1048
18511,"2017m5","After a lot of late nights and too much coffee and chocolate, they came up with this analysis.",1048
18511,"2017m5","They have picked Inditex, Dollarama, Five Below, XXL and B&M, a real mix of shapes and sizes, but if you're holding this portfolio, you probably wouldn't be too concerned by the current challenges in the high street.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you can see, these companies produce good metrics across all the important KPIs, but the really interesting thing is, if you transpose Action's numbers onto this slide, you get a good perspective on the relative quality of the Action growth story.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And none of these 5 stocks has anything like the white space potential of Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I really enjoy being on the Action board.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It has a first-class executive team and a very wise Chairman in Adrian Bellamy.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Expansion on this scale produces its own type of challenges which are really fascinating, and the board is very involved in helping management maintain these strong growth rates while trying to avoid any high-speed problems.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And by the way, the Action compounding effect I mentioned earlier is very material for 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Okay, enough about Action for today, except to say that I look forward to seeing you again at our day with Action management on the 30th of May.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now let's turn to Infrastructure, where the market backdrop is no different.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's significant dry powder and a lot of interest in this sector, which makes it all the more satisfying that our team delivered a very productive year, both expanding 3iN's portfolio and raising 2 new funds.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The team produces growing asset management income for the group, as well as managing investment for 3iN, which in turn has produced very solid capital growth and dividends.",1048
18511,"2017m5","3iN is our main Infrastructure investment vehicle, but we have added some discrete fund initiatives in order to capitalize on 3i's broader network and capabilities and to strengthen the overall team in Infrastructure.",1048
18511,"2017m5","These new initiatives are in their early stages, but we expect them to grow over time and build on the income contribution of Infrastructure to the group.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Apart from investing in our Infrastructure capability and adding selectively to our PE investment team, we're not considering any change in our strategic approach.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I said right at the beginning, we will remain focused on executing our simple strategy, while maintaining a disciplined approach to new investment in those sectors and geographies that we know well.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We will also make the most of our proprietary capital.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That way, we can run our key winners and act more quickly and decisively when this helps secure new investment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you know, this is one of my favorite slides and illustrates what a powerful and efficient cash machine 3i has become.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We're getting better at finding new investment opportunities at sensible prices, and we have established the right processes and portfolio to deliver plenty of cash to reinvest and to distribute to shareholders.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Today, we have proposed a material increase to our additional dividend to reflect the strength of the group and the momentum we have in the business going forward.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Don't assume we'll keep up this level of increase every year, but we are a group that is certainly capable of very attractive cash distributions over time.",1048
18511,"2017m5","This is clearly a decent set of results, and I would like to thank each and every one at 3i for their contribution this year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Many of our people have experienced harsher times, but everybody has worked really hard to secure this type of performance.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But there is no complacency at 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We recognize that the macro is better but still finely balanced, as well as there being potential for more political uncertainty.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our people see the value in our processes and discipline and, as a result, have become better at finding, assessing and managing investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And I would say our teams are as good as any in their respective markets.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you've come to expect, we remain very careful about the costs of our platform.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the Investment Committee remain -- maintains a fierce determination to resist those voices encouraging us to pay more than a given business might be worth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So another decent year where our all-around performance should add to that body of evidence which will help investors properly assess 3i's longer-term potential.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I'll pass over to Julia.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the other question I had was on what industries you're looking at in terms of forward investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Any particular thing that sort of -- industrial subsector that pops to mind? Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",1048
18511,"2017m5","A couple of questions from me.",1048
18511,"2017m5","First is on earnings growth trajectory.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Julia, I think, last year, you sort of commented on experiencing a sort of trough in earnings growth profile and your expectation of it becoming resurgent from there.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You've got a slide where you're showing sort of obviously the Action asset growing more than 30% but about GBP 650 million of value also growing more than 30%.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So do you see that being sustained, the sort of improvement in earnings momentum? Can you give any color around those sort of 4 assets that you detailed as being in that sort of GBP 650 million? What are they? And what's the sort of sustainability there? Second question was around the multiple of Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","How -- if Action continues to grow more than 30% a year, how you think about the interplay between revaluing it up to 18x again, growing into the multiple; or maintaining at 16x? And then on the DCF, I said what we're trying to balance is fantastic performance to date, big potential for future growth, but also there is inherent risk in sort of rolling out in the way they're doing and the execution that we've got.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And for that reason, we wouldn't move it to a DCF basis in our books.",1048
18511,"2017m5","DCF is a very good reference point, especially to the extent people get concerned about the multiple that we're applying.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That gives us sort of confidence in how we're looking at that.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think what we try to do is to give you as much visibility of how we're valuing it.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So to give you all of the components: The multiple we use, you will also find in the press release.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've given you a sensitivity.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So one turn on the multiple would be GBP 135 million on our value, so you can measure it from that perspective.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But I think DCF has definitely got its place and it's definitely a good reference point, but I don't imagine us moving to that method anytime soon.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Philip? Yes.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I mean you don't get absolute, complete uniformity across store performance, but in some of these new countries and certainly in parts of France, we experience better store economics than we experience in Holland.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And in certain parts of Germany, we experience less-good economics than we -- per store than we experience in Holland.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But we find that, as the knowledge about Action and the brand becomes greater, as it has done very quickly in France because we've been able to open more stores more quickly, the economics move up to the Holland economics and even surpass them.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we suspect the same will be true in Germany as the brand awareness builds up over time.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Austria is probably ahead of Holland, as another example to that mix, in terms of store economics.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So as you've heard from Simon, we've had an excellent year, with strong performance from both our Private Equity and Infrastructure businesses.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've been busy.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've generated GBP 1 billion of proceeds from Private Equity, had a robust contribution from Infrastructure and simplified the group with the successful sale of our Debt Management business.",1048
18511,"2017m5","All in all, we finished the year with a total return of 36% and an NAV per share of 604p.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you can see here, the biggest component of our -- of the 30% NAV increase was unrealized value growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Action accounted for 2/3 of the 138p.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we got strong contributions from our more recent investments that Simon has talked about.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That made up most of the rest.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The corresponding net carry payable of 16p includes the benefit of going through the hurdle on an accounting basis on Eurofund V.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I'll explain more about that in a minute.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We did have a tailwind from sterling's weakness of 30p, but our results are strong, with or without that FX benefit.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Finally, the 24p of dividends is made up of last year's final dividend and this year's interim, so the 604p is before the final dividend of 18.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5p that we've announced today.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our Private Equity business had a great year, and they generated a gross investment return of GBP 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That's a 43% return on opening portfolio value, and I'll talk about the main drivers of that in a minute.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It was a very good year for realizations, with 12 full disposals and a number of refinancings and partial realizations, generating GBP 982 million of proceeds.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The uplift to sale of 5%, which excludes refinancings, reflects Mayborn and Amor being valued on an imminent-sale basis last year, along with the proceeds of quoted sales where we don't normally expect a material uplift.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Needless to say, the GBP 49 million loss on Agent Provocateur also affected this measure.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The closing Private Equity portfolio value was GBP 4.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As well as the unrealized value growth, we made good progress on new investment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The GBP 478 million you can see here includes our new investments in Schlemmer, BoConcept and Ponroy Santé; as well as the funding for our existing U.",1048
18511,"2017m5","investment, Q Holding, to make them -- to make their own investment in Degania.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you've already heard, that unrealized value growth of GBP 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","3 billion is underpinned by strong earnings growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The earnings growth of our top 20 investments, which account for 91% of the Private Equity portfolio value, are shown here.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Of course, Action is part of the ""greater than 30%"" bar, but that bar also includes another 4 investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","17 of these 20 investments have positive earnings growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now before I get on to the usual slide on valuations, I'd like to give you some more detail about what we've done to update Action's valuation methodology.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You've seen from Simon's presentation that we think there's still plenty of upside in our investment case.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That presents a problem, a so-called nice problem to have, when we think about how we arrive at the fair value of Action in our books today.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We have to balance Action's exceptional performance and execution, its potential for significant further growth and the inherent risk in continuing to execute at this velocity.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We moved our valuation basis to run rate earnings instead of the last 12 months, or LTM, in March 2013.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The relentless consistency of Action store rollout gave us the confidence to effectively pro forma in 12 months of new stores opened in the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Until now, we've used the run rate earnings to the preceding quarter.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That means, for example, using earnings to the 31st of December for a 31st of March valuation.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Every year since we made the change, Action has outperformed expectations.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That doesn't mean we can go as far as moving the valuation to a DCF basis that some people are talking about, but to recognize our confidence in the performance and execution, we're now using earnings that are as close to our period end as we can.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That means we base this valuation on Action's earnings to the end of March 2017.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Since the third-party interest in our investment in June last year, when we stepped up our valuation to GBP 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5 billion, we have let the multiple fall, as Action's earnings have grown.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now that we've had another year of excellent performance, we've had another look at the multiple, and we've set it to 16x post discount at the 31st of March.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As a result, Action's total value growth in the year was GBP 911 million.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And just over 3/4 of that was down to earnings growth, which is a large part of the GBP 827 million performance category for the whole portfolio, which you can see here.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Other material contributors to that performance category are ATESTEO, EURO-DIESEL and Audley.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Excluding Action, there was a modest decline in the average multiples we used, from 10.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We continue to apply our policy of adjusting multiples down relative to their concept if we think that markets have got ahead of our longer-term view.",1048
18511,"2017m5","14 out of 22 investments were adjusted that way.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The DCF category is dominated by our investment in Scandlines.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the increase that you can see here reflects our view that the competing fixed link will be delayed by another 2 years.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our strong portfolio performance is also reflected in our carry payable and receivable, which we calculate assuming that all investments were sold at their balance sheet value.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I mentioned at the half year, the excellent performance of Action and also Scandlines meant that Eurofund V went through the carry receivable hurdle earlier this year, and that's almost all of the GBP 275 million that you can see here.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The carry payable of GBP 431 million is a product of the same excellent performance.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And it also includes the accrual for the proportion of the carry receivable that will also be paid out to the participating investment teams.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I always make the point that the carry accrued is only paid out when the hurdle has been met on a cash-to-cash basis and then only when cash proceeds are actually received.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We went through the cash hurdle on schemes covering our investments made in 2010, '11 and '12 as a result of the Amor disposal.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That's the main reason for the step-up in cash we paid out this year to GBP 127 million.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now it's clear that the excellent performance from Private Equity is the biggest contributor to our capital returns.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Infrastructure complements and diversifies that because they are the principal contributor to our income returns.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the steps we've taken to grow the Infrastructure business, which Simon has talked about, should enhance that contribution.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We reinforced our support for this business and our belief in our team's ability to originate and manage good investments in the sector by standing behind 3iN's capital raise in June.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We invested GBP 131 million to maintain our 34% shareholding in 3iN.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That was a sound decision.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We -- our team have already deployed the capital raise in 6 new investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And 3iN's share price has increased by 15% since the capital raise.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As a result, 3iN had a very good year, and that's reflected in our GBP 87 million of gross investment return.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You can also see here that our Infrastructure business is a significant contributor to our recurring fee income and cash income.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I mentioned, the new initiatives we have announced should increase their contribution further.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And this is all the more important following our sale of the Debt Management business, which we completed on the 3rd of March 2017.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Selling that business will put pressure on our operating cash profit metric.",1048
18511,"2017m5","However, with the fundamental reshaping of the cost base, good progress in Private Equity and new initiatives in Infrastructure, we will keep it as a measure to reinforce our cost discipline.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That discipline remains relevant as we make incremental investment in new people, in both Private Equity and Infrastructure, to support investment activity and new initiatives.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Operating costs were GBP 117 million in the financial year 2017 without Debt Management.",1048
18511,"2017m5","GBP 63 million of this was incurred in the second half, and we expect our costs in financial year 2018 to be about double that second half expense.",1048
18511,"2017m5","In March, we took a further step in derisking the balance sheet with the repayment of our EUR 331 million bond.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Gross debt is now only GBP 575 million, with an annual interest cost of GBP 35 million, which is down by about GBP 15 million.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We closed the year with net cash of GBP 419 million, but as you know, most of this is now reserved for the recently announced investments in Lampenwelt, Hans Anders and Formel D.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Altogether, they account for about EUR 500 million of investment, which is a good start to the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And with liquidity of GBP 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","3 billion, we are well funded for this new investment and distributions to shareholders.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've announced a final dividend of 18.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5p, subject to shareholder approval.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5p is made up of the final base dividend of 8p and an additional dividend of 10.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That additional dividend takes account of the balance sheet strength, our outlook for realizations and investments; and also recognizes that this has been an excellent year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So it has been another good year for 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And our results have been underpinned by strategic progress in reshaping the business, excellent performance from Private Equity and a very good year for the Infrastructure team.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Thank you, and we'll now take questions.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And perhaps you could also talk a little bit about how -- when the board is looking at Action and the fact it's 30% of NAV, and how they think about the terms of the sort of risk versus reward of that situation? Charles Murphy, Panmure Gordon.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Eurofund V comes to an end at the end of -- potentially it comes to the end at the end of 2018.",1048
18511,"2017m5","How does -- what opportunities are there for you to extend that a bit further? And how does that affect how you think about Action and Scandlines? Arun Melmane, Macquarie.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Could I just ask? You sort of had the map of Action, and you sort of looked at the white spaces.",1048
18511,"2017m5","What gives you so much confidence that the white space in probably France and Germany is almost alike in terms of revenue potential? Or even if you extend that across Europe, why do you think the white spaces are the same in terms of property as you would see in sort of the Holland or the old places that Action did so well in? Why don't I take the first two? And Julia can come back to the third because she did touch on it in her presentation.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I mean we've had an unusually strong start, I would say, to the rapidity of investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And it's a bit like catching a bus, isn't it? And so we have signed quite a few deals in a short space of time.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's absolutely no guarantee that the rest of the year will continue at that pace.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And I would expect it to moderate and for us to be more careful.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But I do think we will invest more money this year than we have previously and get closer to our sort of run rate of investment of around GBP 700 million, GBP 750 million, if you like.",1048
18511,"2017m5","In terms of realizations, it's early in the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There are things moving forward, but I would again expect, between realizations and refis, we'll get closer to our normal level, which is around the GBP 750 million, GBP 800 million type level if markets remain conducive to that.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Chris Brown from JPMorgan.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Just a quick question about post-year-end events.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I mean, clearly, there's been a lot of investment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You've got the dividend to come out.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Has there been much on the realization front since 31st of March? It's Philip Middleton from Merrill's.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I wonder, could you say a little bit more about what you see happening in investments? Because if I had to criticize what you've been doing until fairly recently, the net investment rate was relatively slow compared to where it needed to be on a steady-state basis.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You seem to be kind of more steady state now.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Is that something you think is sustainable as you redeploy staff in that area? How do you see the investment landscape, the opportunity set? And just more generally, how do you feel about the sort of [ outtrade ] at the moment? We'll let Morgan Stanley do that for us.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Okay, if there are no more questions.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Thanks very much for coming.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Have a good day.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Adedapo Oguntade from Morgan Stanley.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Just 3 questions here.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So one, in terms of your investment for FY '18, it is very close to EUR 500 million.",1048
18511,"2017m5","What's your guidance pretty much for the rest of the year? Two, also looking at your PE assets, it is down to 37 assets and 3 quoted holdings at any -- at the moment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","In the last few years, you've had a situation of net -- pretty much net realizations -- or realizations have been up of your investment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Going forward, what should we expect? And then the last question, this comes to Action: Given your long-term growth potential in Action and the earnings performance, as well as the enormous white space available in Europe, do you think it's going to be better to apply this year? There is an opportunity to extend that, with the agreement of the LPs, for another year, so to the end of '19.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We obviously haven't come to any view about that yet, but that's an important decision for next year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think if you step back and look at the information that we have, what's occurred really is this year was a very busy year in terms of realizations early on.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So a lot of that realization occurred in the first half.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And it's tidied up, on top of the previous 4 years, the portfolio considerably.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And therefore, what we're seeing is our teams devoting much, much more of their time to origination and therefore the WIP bucket, as we call it, being much fuller; and the ability for us to look across quite a good population of assets and to determine the ones that -- which we wish to pursue.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And that's not only about the investment thesis in the business but how we think we'll do in competition with others if there is competition and whether ultimately we'll be able to buy it at a price that we're comfortable with.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So there's quite a lot of judgments into how you manage that WIP down.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But it's really starting from the fact that, with a smaller, more manageable portfolio that has got less things going wrong with it, we can spend a lot more time originating.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And therefore, we're getting into a better rhythm in terms of investment, and it gives us the position to make choices over what we do, which is very important.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Chris? We look at a variety of things.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You know that automotive often features prominently.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think I mentioned disruptive retailing is another sector we're looking very closely at.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've had a bit of a leaner time on, if you like, B2B businesses lately and we're looking harder at a number of those.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's 1 or 2 interesting opportunities in the States.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I don't know if they will happen, but we're certainly looking at a bunch of things.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So it's the same themes that we're planning to do.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's no change in that.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Do you have a question? Yes.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's a number of things going through.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think of the order of about GBP 100 million is sort of coming in over the recent weeks.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It's that sort of thing in smaller initiatives.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And there are 1 or 2 big things beginning to move along in terms of realizations.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I mean, yes, you're right.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We did signal that when -- well, by about this time last year, we had quite a lot lower growth in the portfolio ex Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think, at that time, that was particularly the impact of some of the weaker assets that we've talked about previously, so the Dynatects of this world and some of the retailers.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But what we're seeing now in the portfolio ex Action is the benefit of the new investments that we've done coming through their first phase of ownership and starting to really flow through into the earnings growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So we've talked -- I'm not going to name all of the companies that are in the different bars, but we've talked about the good earnings growth that we see in the likes of Audley with a strong U.",1048
18511,"2017m5","performance but also a growing U.",1048
18511,"2017m5","For example, ATESTEO, you've seen, has done a refinancing this year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So that's also performing strongly.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So the average ex Action is always going to go up and down a little bit, especially when you've got a smaller number of companies.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So it's going to be very idiosyncratic to what's happening in a particular period, but I think what we're trying to show today is our confidence in the portfolio ex Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And then clearly, we have this fantastic asset on top of that as well.",1048
18511,"2017m5","On the multiple, I mean, we're content where we are in the valuation today.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I said, we're trying to balance a number of factors, but we continue to keep it under review.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The business is obviously performing extremely well.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And you saw from the slide that Simon put up the potential for future growth, so I wouldn't view the 16x as fixed, but I wouldn't try and formula in some sort of rate of improvement or increase in that.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's a number of things going through.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think of the order of about GBP 100 million is sort of coming in over the recent weeks.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It's that sort of thing in smaller initiatives.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And there are 1 or 2 big things beginning to move along in terms of realizations.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We'll let Morgan Stanley do that for us.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Chris Brown from JPMorgan.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Just a quick question about post-year-end events.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I mean, clearly, there's been a lot of investment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You've got the dividend to come out.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Has there been much on the realization front since 31st of March? Yes.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Well, I mean, we consider that position carefully.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We debate it within the Investment Committee.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We debate it within the board.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There are some voices that said, if we could have 100% of our assets in Action, we should.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And there are others who are more cautious about the weighting.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But I think we're a long way from where we'll be uncomfortable with how much we own of Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It's Philip Middleton from Merrill's.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I wonder, could you say a little bit more about what you see happening in investments? Because if I had to criticize what you've been doing until fairly recently, the net investment rate was relatively slow compared to where it needed to be on a steady-state basis.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You seem to be kind of more steady state now.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Is that something you think is sustainable as you redeploy staff in that area? How do you see the investment landscape, the opportunity set? And just more generally, how do you feel about the sort of [ outtrade ] at the moment? And then on the DCF, I said what we're trying to balance is fantastic performance to date, big potential for future growth, but also there is inherent risk in sort of rolling out in the way they're doing and the execution that we've got.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And for that reason, we wouldn't move it to a DCF basis in our books.",1048
18511,"2017m5","DCF is a very good reference point, especially to the extent people get concerned about the multiple that we're applying.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That gives us sort of confidence in how we're looking at that.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think what we try to do is to give you as much visibility of how we're valuing it.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So to give you all of the components: The multiple we use, you will also find in the press release.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've given you a sensitivity.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So one turn on the multiple would be GBP 135 million on our value, so you can measure it from that perspective.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But I think DCF has definitely got its place and it's definitely a good reference point, but I don't imagine us moving to that method anytime soon.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Charles Murphy, Panmure Gordon.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Eurofund V comes to an end at the end of -- potentially it comes to the end at the end of 2018.",1048
18511,"2017m5","How does -- what opportunities are there for you to extend that a bit further? And how does that affect how you think about Action and Scandlines? Philip? Why don't I take the first two? And Julia can come back to the third because she did touch on it in her presentation.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I mean we've had an unusually strong start, I would say, to the rapidity of investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And it's a bit like catching a bus, isn't it? And so we have signed quite a few deals in a short space of time.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's absolutely no guarantee that the rest of the year will continue at that pace.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And I would expect it to moderate and for us to be more careful.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But I do think we will invest more money this year than we have previously and get closer to our sort of run rate of investment of around GBP 700 million, GBP 750 million, if you like.",1048
18511,"2017m5","In terms of realizations, it's early in the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There are things moving forward, but I would again expect, between realizations and refis, we'll get closer to our normal level, which is around the GBP 750 million, GBP 800 million type level if markets remain conducive to that.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think if you step back and look at the information that we have, what's occurred really is this year was a very busy year in terms of realizations early on.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So a lot of that realization occurred in the first half.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And it's tidied up, on top of the previous 4 years, the portfolio considerably.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And therefore, what we're seeing is our teams devoting much, much more of their time to origination and therefore the WIP bucket, as we call it, being much fuller; and the ability for us to look across quite a good population of assets and to determine the ones that -- which we wish to pursue.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And that's not only about the investment thesis in the business but how we think we'll do in competition with others if there is competition and whether ultimately we'll be able to buy it at a price that we're comfortable with.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So there's quite a lot of judgments into how you manage that WIP down.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But it's really starting from the fact that, with a smaller, more manageable portfolio that has got less things going wrong with it, we can spend a lot more time originating.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And therefore, we're getting into a better rhythm in terms of investment, and it gives us the position to make choices over what we do, which is very important.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Chris? Daniel Garrod from Barclays.",1048
18511,"2017m5","A couple of questions from me.",1048
18511,"2017m5","First is on earnings growth trajectory.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Julia, I think, last year, you sort of commented on experiencing a sort of trough in earnings growth profile and your expectation of it becoming resurgent from there.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You've got a slide where you're showing sort of obviously the Action asset growing more than 30% but about GBP 650 million of value also growing more than 30%.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So do you see that being sustained, the sort of improvement in earnings momentum? Can you give any color around those sort of 4 assets that you detailed as being in that sort of GBP 650 million? What are they? And what's the sort of sustainability there? Second question was around the multiple of Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","How -- if Action continues to grow more than 30% a year, how you think about the interplay between revaluing it up to 18x again, growing into the multiple; or maintaining at 16x? There is an opportunity to extend that, with the agreement of the LPs, for another year, so to the end of '19.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We obviously haven't come to any view about that yet, but that's an important decision for next year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I mean, yes, you're right.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We did signal that when -- well, by about this time last year, we had quite a lot lower growth in the portfolio ex Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think, at that time, that was particularly the impact of some of the weaker assets that we've talked about previously, so the Dynatects of this world and some of the retailers.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But what we're seeing now in the portfolio ex Action is the benefit of the new investments that we've done coming through their first phase of ownership and starting to really flow through into the earnings growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So we've talked -- I'm not going to name all of the companies that are in the different bars, but we've talked about the good earnings growth that we see in the likes of Audley with a strong U.",1048
18511,"2017m5","performance but also a growing U.",1048
18511,"2017m5","For example, ATESTEO, you've seen, has done a refinancing this year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So that's also performing strongly.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So the average ex Action is always going to go up and down a little bit, especially when you've got a smaller number of companies.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So it's going to be very idiosyncratic to what's happening in a particular period, but I think what we're trying to show today is our confidence in the portfolio ex Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And then clearly, we have this fantastic asset on top of that as well.",1048
18511,"2017m5","On the multiple, I mean, we're content where we are in the valuation today.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I said, we're trying to balance a number of factors, but we continue to keep it under review.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The business is obviously performing extremely well.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And you saw from the slide that Simon put up the potential for future growth, so I wouldn't view the 16x as fixed, but I wouldn't try and formula in some sort of rate of improvement or increase in that.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Arun Melmane, Macquarie.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Could I just ask? You sort of had the map of Action, and you sort of looked at the white spaces.",1048
18511,"2017m5","What gives you so much confidence that the white space in probably France and Germany is almost alike in terms of revenue potential? Or even if you extend that across Europe, why do you think the white spaces are the same in terms of property as you would see in sort of the Holland or the old places that Action did so well in? We look at a variety of things.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You know that automotive often features prominently.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I think I mentioned disruptive retailing is another sector we're looking very closely at.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've had a bit of a leaner time on, if you like, B2B businesses lately and we're looking harder at a number of those.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's 1 or 2 interesting opportunities in the States.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I don't know if they will happen, but we're certainly looking at a bunch of things.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So it's the same themes that we're planning to do.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's no change in that.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Do you have a question? And the other question I had was on what industries you're looking at in terms of forward investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Any particular thing that sort of -- industrial subsector that pops to mind? And perhaps you could also talk a little bit about how -- when the board is looking at Action and the fact it's 30% of NAV, and how they think about the terms of the sort of risk versus reward of that situation? Yes.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I mean you don't get absolute, complete uniformity across store performance, but in some of these new countries and certainly in parts of France, we experience better store economics than we experience in Holland.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And in certain parts of Germany, we experience less-good economics than we -- per store than we experience in Holland.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But we find that, as the knowledge about Action and the brand becomes greater, as it has done very quickly in France because we've been able to open more stores more quickly, the economics move up to the Holland economics and even surpass them.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we suspect the same will be true in Germany as the brand awareness builds up over time.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Austria is probably ahead of Holland, as another example to that mix, in terms of store economics.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Adedapo Oguntade from Morgan Stanley.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Just 3 questions here.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So one, in terms of your investment for FY '18, it is very close to EUR 500 million.",1048
18511,"2017m5","What's your guidance pretty much for the rest of the year? Two, also looking at your PE assets, it is down to 37 assets and 3 quoted holdings at any -- at the moment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","In the last few years, you've had a situation of net -- pretty much net realizations -- or realizations have been up of your investment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Going forward, what should we expect? And then the last question, this comes to Action: Given your long-term growth potential in Action and the earnings performance, as well as the enormous white space available in Europe, do you think it's going to be better to apply this year? Okay, if there are no more questions.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Thanks very much for coming.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Have a good day.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So as you've heard from Simon, we've had an excellent year, with strong performance from both our Private Equity and Infrastructure businesses.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've been busy.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've generated GBP 1 billion of proceeds from Private Equity, had a robust contribution from Infrastructure and simplified the group with the successful sale of our Debt Management business.",1048
18511,"2017m5","All in all, we finished the year with a total return of 36% and an NAV per share of 604p.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you can see here, the biggest component of our -- of the 30% NAV increase was unrealized value growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Action accounted for 2/3 of the 138p.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we got strong contributions from our more recent investments that Simon has talked about.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That made up most of the rest.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The corresponding net carry payable of 16p includes the benefit of going through the hurdle on an accounting basis on Eurofund V.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I'll explain more about that in a minute.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We did have a tailwind from sterling's weakness of 30p, but our results are strong, with or without that FX benefit.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Finally, the 24p of dividends is made up of last year's final dividend and this year's interim, so the 604p is before the final dividend of 18.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5p that we've announced today.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our Private Equity business had a great year, and they generated a gross investment return of GBP 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That's a 43% return on opening portfolio value, and I'll talk about the main drivers of that in a minute.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It was a very good year for realizations, with 12 full disposals and a number of refinancings and partial realizations, generating GBP 982 million of proceeds.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The uplift to sale of 5%, which excludes refinancings, reflects Mayborn and Amor being valued on an imminent-sale basis last year, along with the proceeds of quoted sales where we don't normally expect a material uplift.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Needless to say, the GBP 49 million loss on Agent Provocateur also affected this measure.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The closing Private Equity portfolio value was GBP 4.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As well as the unrealized value growth, we made good progress on new investment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The GBP 478 million you can see here includes our new investments in Schlemmer, BoConcept and Ponroy Santé; as well as the funding for our existing U.",1048
18511,"2017m5","investment, Q Holding, to make them -- to make their own investment in Degania.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you've already heard, that unrealized value growth of GBP 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","3 billion is underpinned by strong earnings growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The earnings growth of our top 20 investments, which account for 91% of the Private Equity portfolio value, are shown here.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Of course, Action is part of the ""greater than 30%"" bar, but that bar also includes another 4 investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","17 of these 20 investments have positive earnings growth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now before I get on to the usual slide on valuations, I'd like to give you some more detail about what we've done to update Action's valuation methodology.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You've seen from Simon's presentation that we think there's still plenty of upside in our investment case.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That presents a problem, a so-called nice problem to have, when we think about how we arrive at the fair value of Action in our books today.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We have to balance Action's exceptional performance and execution, its potential for significant further growth and the inherent risk in continuing to execute at this velocity.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We moved our valuation basis to run rate earnings instead of the last 12 months, or LTM, in March 2013.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The relentless consistency of Action store rollout gave us the confidence to effectively pro forma in 12 months of new stores opened in the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Until now, we've used the run rate earnings to the preceding quarter.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That means, for example, using earnings to the 31st of December for a 31st of March valuation.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Every year since we made the change, Action has outperformed expectations.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That doesn't mean we can go as far as moving the valuation to a DCF basis that some people are talking about, but to recognize our confidence in the performance and execution, we're now using earnings that are as close to our period end as we can.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That means we base this valuation on Action's earnings to the end of March 2017.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Since the third-party interest in our investment in June last year, when we stepped up our valuation to GBP 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5 billion, we have let the multiple fall, as Action's earnings have grown.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now that we've had another year of excellent performance, we've had another look at the multiple, and we've set it to 16x post discount at the 31st of March.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As a result, Action's total value growth in the year was GBP 911 million.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And just over 3/4 of that was down to earnings growth, which is a large part of the GBP 827 million performance category for the whole portfolio, which you can see here.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Other material contributors to that performance category are ATESTEO, EURO-DIESEL and Audley.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Excluding Action, there was a modest decline in the average multiples we used, from 10.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We continue to apply our policy of adjusting multiples down relative to their concept if we think that markets have got ahead of our longer-term view.",1048
18511,"2017m5","14 out of 22 investments were adjusted that way.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The DCF category is dominated by our investment in Scandlines.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the increase that you can see here reflects our view that the competing fixed link will be delayed by another 2 years.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our strong portfolio performance is also reflected in our carry payable and receivable, which we calculate assuming that all investments were sold at their balance sheet value.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I mentioned at the half year, the excellent performance of Action and also Scandlines meant that Eurofund V went through the carry receivable hurdle earlier this year, and that's almost all of the GBP 275 million that you can see here.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The carry payable of GBP 431 million is a product of the same excellent performance.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And it also includes the accrual for the proportion of the carry receivable that will also be paid out to the participating investment teams.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I always make the point that the carry accrued is only paid out when the hurdle has been met on a cash-to-cash basis and then only when cash proceeds are actually received.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We went through the cash hurdle on schemes covering our investments made in 2010, '11 and '12 as a result of the Amor disposal.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That's the main reason for the step-up in cash we paid out this year to GBP 127 million.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now it's clear that the excellent performance from Private Equity is the biggest contributor to our capital returns.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Infrastructure complements and diversifies that because they are the principal contributor to our income returns.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the steps we've taken to grow the Infrastructure business, which Simon has talked about, should enhance that contribution.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We reinforced our support for this business and our belief in our team's ability to originate and manage good investments in the sector by standing behind 3iN's capital raise in June.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We invested GBP 131 million to maintain our 34% shareholding in 3iN.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That was a sound decision.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We -- our team have already deployed the capital raise in 6 new investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And 3iN's share price has increased by 15% since the capital raise.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As a result, 3iN had a very good year, and that's reflected in our GBP 87 million of gross investment return.",1048
18511,"2017m5","You can also see here that our Infrastructure business is a significant contributor to our recurring fee income and cash income.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I mentioned, the new initiatives we have announced should increase their contribution further.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And this is all the more important following our sale of the Debt Management business, which we completed on the 3rd of March 2017.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Selling that business will put pressure on our operating cash profit metric.",1048
18511,"2017m5","However, with the fundamental reshaping of the cost base, good progress in Private Equity and new initiatives in Infrastructure, we will keep it as a measure to reinforce our cost discipline.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That discipline remains relevant as we make incremental investment in new people, in both Private Equity and Infrastructure, to support investment activity and new initiatives.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Operating costs were GBP 117 million in the financial year 2017 without Debt Management.",1048
18511,"2017m5","GBP 63 million of this was incurred in the second half, and we expect our costs in financial year 2018 to be about double that second half expense.",1048
18511,"2017m5","In March, we took a further step in derisking the balance sheet with the repayment of our EUR 331 million bond.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Gross debt is now only GBP 575 million, with an annual interest cost of GBP 35 million, which is down by about GBP 15 million.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We closed the year with net cash of GBP 419 million, but as you know, most of this is now reserved for the recently announced investments in Lampenwelt, Hans Anders and Formel D.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Altogether, they account for about EUR 500 million of investment, which is a good start to the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And with liquidity of GBP 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","3 billion, we are well funded for this new investment and distributions to shareholders.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We've announced a final dividend of 18.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5p, subject to shareholder approval.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5p is made up of the final base dividend of 8p and an additional dividend of 10.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That additional dividend takes account of the balance sheet strength, our outlook for realizations and investments; and also recognizes that this has been an excellent year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So it has been another good year for 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And our results have been underpinned by strategic progress in reshaping the business, excellent performance from Private Equity and a very good year for the Infrastructure team.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Thank you, and we'll now take questions.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Good morning, everyone.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Welcome to 3i's results for the year to 31st of March 2017.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As anticipated, and most of you will have seen, it's been another strong year for 3i with good results across-the-board, and we have a clear and consistent strategy.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So how did we do over the last 12 months? We closed the year with a 36% return on equity, an NAV of 604p and an increased dividend of 26.",1048
18511,"2017m5","5p for the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Both Private Equity and Infrastructure performed well, with good levels of new investment and strong portfolio performances.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we completed the sale of our Debt Management division in March.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The sale simplifies the group and focuses our people and resources on 2 high-quality businesses.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Realizations for the year were very strong with almost GBP 1 billion from Private Equity and a further GBP 270 million from the sale of Debt Management.",1048
18511,"2017m5","3i is now performing as it should, and the approach we've taken over the last 5 years has transformed the group on all key KPIs.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Today's results are built on the sound fundamentals that we have put in place.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the numbers don't tell the full story.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The portfolio value number is considerably larger, but just as importantly, our portfolio today is made up of a smaller set of stronger, cleaner companies with much better earnings and value momentum.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So I've broken my presentation down into 4 parts, with one part being Action, but I'd like to start with Private Equity.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We still have a dry powder issue in this sector, and it's even bigger today than this time last year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Most of this dry powder is in the mega funds, but those of us in the midmarket still have to maintain the discipline we have demonstrated over the last 5 years.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we've got to continue looking for opportunities away from broad-based auctions, as we successfully did this year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our PE team had a great year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","They delivered a 43% return; a good level of exciting, new investments; as well as GBP 1 billion of realizations, so a good harvest but some quality seed sown for the future.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Earnings and value growth have both accelerated across our Private Equity portfolio, with our larger bucket 1 investments continuing to make a major contribution.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The performance from our '13, '16 vintage has been particularly strong, and we have seen much less value reduction this year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our '13, '16 vintage is still a relatively immature portfolio, and yet it kicked in a 29% return for the year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Of course, there are 1 or 2 weak spots, but in general we have seen really solid growth right across the portfolio.",1048
18511,"2017m5","At the interims, I mentioned the problems of Agent Provocateur, where accounting irregularities had concealed the true financial position of the company and its lack of liquidity.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you know, we were not able to sort out the problems, and the company went into an administration process in March.",1048
18511,"2017m5","This resulted in a GBP 49 million write-off for 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Moving on, our investments since 2013 are performing well, with the '13, '16 vintage already at 1.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the new investments of the last 12 months, BoConcept, Schlemmer, Ponroy Santé, are already making a promising contribution.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The investments we made since financial year '13, including the ones we've recently announced, now total about GBP 2 billion.",1048
18511,"2017m5","These new assets will underpin significant gains going forward, especially if we beat our minimum 2x target.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And we've entered this year with strong new investment momentum with the purchase of Lampenwelt, Hans Anders and Formel D.",1048
18511,"2017m5","These 3 new investments are all in our sweet spot: 2 disruptive retailers and a B2B German service business focused on the automotive sector.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It's been another strong year of realizations and refinancings.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I said a minute ago, the makeup of our Private Equity portfolio has been transformed by careful purchases and by the sale of many of our weaker legacy assets.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We are now down to 37 companies.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That's a net reduction of close to 100 over that 5-year period.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And buckets 1 and 2 now account for 86% of total value.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That means that our investment teams are spending much more time on origination, and rather than waiting for the next bank auction, they're approaching companies directly and initiating bilateral discussions.",1048
18511,"2017m5","This approach is leading to good-quality, new investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","In fact, both Ponroy and Lampenwelt are great examples of what I mean, and I'm quietly confident that they will both be strong assets for 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now what about Action? The company continues to surpass all normal expectations.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Action has really brought home to me the power of compounding.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Whether you look at sales, number of stores or EBITDA, the returns this company generates off a larger and larger base are exceptional.",1048
18511,"2017m5","When you combine all these positive factors with strong like-for-likes and sector-leading cash generation, you benefit from an outstanding returns on capital.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And I don't think we're anywhere near the peak for Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Although it's increasing the number of stores it opens every year, it is barely scratching the surface of how big it can become.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you can see from this chart, store densities in Holland suggest that there is considerable white space opportunity in just France and Germany alone, and that's before we even consider the rest of Europe.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I have said before, an Action store appeals to customers wherever we have opened them.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Action is part of that very exclusive set of retailers that have one format that works across borders in different retail environments and is therefore capable of achieving very significant scale.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now at 3i we have a small but very brainy strategy team.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And when they're not helping Julia sell our Debt business, I ask them to look at things for me.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Earlier this year, I asked them to think of themselves as specialist fund managers, focusing on retail stocks, and to come up with the 5 or 6 stocks they would have in their top bucket.",1048
18511,"2017m5","After a lot of late nights and too much coffee and chocolate, they came up with this analysis.",1048
18511,"2017m5","They have picked Inditex, Dollarama, Five Below, XXL and B&M, a real mix of shapes and sizes, but if you're holding this portfolio, you probably wouldn't be too concerned by the current challenges in the high street.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you can see, these companies produce good metrics across all the important KPIs, but the really interesting thing is, if you transpose Action's numbers onto this slide, you get a good perspective on the relative quality of the Action growth story.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And none of these 5 stocks has anything like the white space potential of Action.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I really enjoy being on the Action board.",1048
18511,"2017m5","It has a first-class executive team and a very wise Chairman in Adrian Bellamy.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Expansion on this scale produces its own type of challenges which are really fascinating, and the board is very involved in helping management maintain these strong growth rates while trying to avoid any high-speed problems.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And by the way, the Action compounding effect I mentioned earlier is very material for 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Okay, enough about Action for today, except to say that I look forward to seeing you again at our day with Action management on the 30th of May.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Now let's turn to Infrastructure, where the market backdrop is no different.",1048
18511,"2017m5","There's significant dry powder and a lot of interest in this sector, which makes it all the more satisfying that our team delivered a very productive year, both expanding 3iN's portfolio and raising 2 new funds.",1048
18511,"2017m5","The team produces growing asset management income for the group, as well as managing investment for 3iN, which in turn has produced very solid capital growth and dividends.",1048
18511,"2017m5","3iN is our main Infrastructure investment vehicle, but we have added some discrete fund initiatives in order to capitalize on 3i's broader network and capabilities and to strengthen the overall team in Infrastructure.",1048
18511,"2017m5","These new initiatives are in their early stages, but we expect them to grow over time and build on the income contribution of Infrastructure to the group.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Apart from investing in our Infrastructure capability and adding selectively to our PE investment team, we're not considering any change in our strategic approach.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As I said right at the beginning, we will remain focused on executing our simple strategy, while maintaining a disciplined approach to new investment in those sectors and geographies that we know well.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We will also make the most of our proprietary capital.",1048
18511,"2017m5","That way, we can run our key winners and act more quickly and decisively when this helps secure new investment.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you know, this is one of my favorite slides and illustrates what a powerful and efficient cash machine 3i has become.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We're getting better at finding new investment opportunities at sensible prices, and we have established the right processes and portfolio to deliver plenty of cash to reinvest and to distribute to shareholders.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Today, we have proposed a material increase to our additional dividend to reflect the strength of the group and the momentum we have in the business going forward.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Don't assume we'll keep up this level of increase every year, but we are a group that is certainly capable of very attractive cash distributions over time.",1048
18511,"2017m5","This is clearly a decent set of results, and I would like to thank each and every one at 3i for their contribution this year.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Many of our people have experienced harsher times, but everybody has worked really hard to secure this type of performance.",1048
18511,"2017m5","But there is no complacency at 3i.",1048
18511,"2017m5","We recognize that the macro is better but still finely balanced, as well as there being potential for more political uncertainty.",1048
18511,"2017m5","Our people see the value in our processes and discipline and, as a result, have become better at finding, assessing and managing investments.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And I would say our teams are as good as any in their respective markets.",1048
18511,"2017m5","As you've come to expect, we remain very careful about the costs of our platform.",1048
18511,"2017m5","And the Investment Committee remain -- maintains a fierce determination to resist those voices encouraging us to pay more than a given business might be worth.",1048
18511,"2017m5","So another decent year where our all-around performance should add to that body of evidence which will help investors properly assess 3i's longer-term potential.",1048
18511,"2017m5","I'll pass over to Julia.",1048
18511,"2018m11","Yes, very simply.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That was the Finance Director who moved on Frederick at the end of the summer.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We bought in his stake but that's what that amounts to.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Let's begin.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Good morning.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Welcome to 3i's interim results presentation.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As we remind you every time we meet, our strategy aims to deliver mid- to high teens returns to our shareholders.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We do that through a combination of thoughtful capitalized allocation, a disciplined approach to making fee and infrastructure investments and through solid portfolio management.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As you will have seen from the results we announced this morning, we're making good progress on all our strategic objectives, so let's look at the detail.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It's been another good half for 3i.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We've delivered a steady flow of realizations and good portfolio growth across both divisions, underpinning our returns.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We also made some attractive new investments as well as a number of bolt-on acquisitions across our portfolio.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We just need to wait for the slides to move, I'm afraid.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So another good financial results with a total return of 10% in the first half and good momentum across both portfolios.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We've taken advantage of the plentiful supply of dry powder with a decent flow of realizations of good prices.",1567
18511,"2018m11","But on the buy side, we've been careful to avoid those processes that have attracted the big spenders.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Our Private Equity team has delivered another very good return.",1567
18511,"2018m11","In general, the portfolio is developing well, with good momentum in a number of our larger assets.",1567
18511,"2018m11","In the new deal market, we focused only on those assets while we have a high degree of conviction that we can meet or beat our target of 2x.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We've also recovered significant value in some of our legacy investments as well as managing excellent realizations in Scandlines and Basic-Fit.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Our portfolio has continued to perform well, with good earnings growth, in particular, in fee write-downs.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Apart from action and AES, the growth has all come from our recent investments, some of which are now growing very strongly.",1567
18511,"2018m11","There is one very disappointing number on the right of this page, which is frustrating.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And [indiscernible] Schlemmer, our cable protection business in new automated sector.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Schlemmer has continued to achieve good top line growth but has struggled with its operational and procurement costs.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This has impacted cash flow and has been compounded by poor controls and problems with some legacy IT systems.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The problem boils down to week leadership and the need to accelerate an operational improvement plan.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So over the summer, we concluded we have to change the CEO and other top managers, then rebase the investment.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We now have a strong new CEO and CFO combination, and we made a number of other senior appointments to Schlemmer back on track.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As I said earlier, we continued to be careful purchases, passing on new numerous opportunities this year on price expectations alone.",1567
18511,"2018m11","In fact, we've been very surprised with some of the prices being paid for decent unexceptional businesses.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So we've worked hard to seek out opportunities where we can exploit our competitive advantage.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Always straightforward acquisitions for existing portfolio companies deliver both cash synergies and strategic benefits.",1567
18511,"2018m11","At the same time, our conviction about the quality of our current portfolio and the value of putting more resource in capital behind our winners has increased.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I remain confident that through a combination of our geographic origination teams and established sector investments, we can continue to grow and refresh our portfolio.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Royal Sanders is an interesting example of where we have used our establishing portfolio to gain a competitive advantage to secure a high-quality consumer asset in the Netherlands.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Royal Sanders has a very strong track record based on the private label initiatives of the high-grade discount and convenient retail sector across Continental Europe and the U.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And the company is a key partner as a contract manufacturer for high-growth brands in Europe.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And shortly after completing of the acquisition, we entered into negotiations with McBride to buy that personal care plant in the U.",1567
18511,"2018m11","and Belgium.",1567
18511,"2018m11","There is a very -- this is a very exciting development for Royal Sanders, and we hope to conclude this acquisition this month.",1567
18511,"2018m11","ICE is another good example of a thoughtful purchase.",1567
18511,"2018m11","With ICE, we focused on an asset which has few peers and is a relatively complex business.",1567
18511,"2018m11","But it's in the travel sector which we know well.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The role of ICE is to sell travel inventory to consumers via third-party loyalty programs.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And ICE has proprietary software to make it work.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Let me give you an example of what ICE does.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As I'm sure you know, the -- it is important for a cruise ship to sell with a full complement in its cabins because the cruise companies get a big part of their revenue from on-ship purchases during the cruise itself.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So large cruise companies use ICE to sell excess cabin inventory into loyalty programs while consumers can buy cabins at opaque prices through the redemption of loyalty credits and cash.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And the new leadership is, i.",1567
18511,"2018m11",", without an existing fan club or the more tricky the market, the more crucial the role of ICE in dealing with that unsold inventory.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We bought both ICE and Royal Sanders at sensible prices, and they are performing ahead of our investment case.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As I said minutes ago, we've been busy with portfolio M&A across a good number of assets.",1567
18511,"2018m11","In the last 12 months alone, the total amount -- the total amounted to some EUR 375 million of enterprise value.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The majority of the acquisitions we've made have been financed by the cash flows of our portfolio companies without the need of equity from 3i, and we have a strong pipeline of further bolt-on investments going forward.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Now we signaled in me that we were target some GBP 700 million to GBP 800 million of realizations this year.",1567
18511,"2018m11","After taking account of the Scandlines reinvestment, we've already raised over GBP 500 million of that target, and we've got a number of other processes in trend.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Importantly, the realizations of recent vintage investments, Scandlines and Basic-Fit, have been made their return significantly ahead of our 2x target.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Scandlines has been a great investment for 3i, particularly since we bought the 50% from in Allianz 2013.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We're holding onto a 35% stake in the company because we are convinced about the strength of the business and its cash flows and the likelihood of further valuable growth over time.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That's been another tricky year for service in Europe, with the continued growth of online competition, extreme weather in both winter and summer, strikes and truck drivers shortages.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And you've seen the negative impact of this across numerous retail results announcement already this year, but you won't be seeing too much of an impact on actions.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Actions has contributed GBP 271 million of valuable growth in the first half, and that's been based purely on earnings growth.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Actions continue to grow strongly this year, with sales to date up about 24% over 2016.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Actions put a lot more focus this year on building solid foundations for future growth, with significant investments in commercial, stock planning, distribution and supply chain capabilities.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We recruited a new planning team as well as adding a number of real experienced people to the commercial and supply chain teams.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We've also embarked on a significant acceleration of our DC network.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We are now planning to open 3 new DCs in 2019 and a further 3 in the following 18 months.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The DC rollout is a big project that will facilitate Action's ambition to become a pan-European GBP 10 billion sales company.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Like-for-like this year are up around 3% in all of our 3 biggest markets of Holland, France and Germany.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And I'm sure that performance compares well with other retailers in Continental Europe.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It represents continued decent performance in Holland and Germany, but actually a real drop for Action's French stores.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Francis remain strong but basket size has been smaller as a result to supply issues.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As we told you last May, we've struggled with operational issues in the supply chain of action, and that has led to product availability problems, particularly in France, our largest market.",1567
18511,"2018m11","In many ways, we have an exclusive problem in France.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We have a very large number of high-performing stores, with annual turnovers ranging between EUR 6 million and EUR 10 million, EUR 3 million is the average action store.",1567
18511,"2018m11","But these stores need considerable logistical support given the value of goods physically going through them.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And at the moment, we can't provide a timing and comprehensive stock delivery as we would like.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So why a like-for-likes are relatively good in France, they are clearly not as good as they could be.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Here are 2 stores that we opened in September.",1567
18511,"2018m11","One is in the south and one is in the north of France, and that both in modest towns rather than the city.",1567
18511,"2018m11","See what I mean about footfall.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Both those stores sold out almost 1/3 of our entire stock and the first day alone.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We opened a new DC at Leon in February and a further DC in Northwest France in early 2020, which will put us in a much better position to feed the high volume French store network effectively.",1567
18511,"2018m11","In the meantime, we've decided to defer into January 2019 the opening of about 20 stores we have plan to open in France next month.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That way, we can more effectively manage our peak trading month of December in France.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We will still open some 230 stores across the Action network in 2018 once we allow for this change.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So Action is becoming a very large business.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It needs solid foundations in a resilient supply chain that really capitalize on the attraction to format consumers wherever it opens.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Now I'd like to turn to infrastructure, where the team is putting together another strong performance based on strong asset management, quality new investment and good AUM growth.",1567
18511,"2018m11","3i Infrastructure PLC is having another good year.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It produced a 16% TSR in the first half, and we've seen [indiscernible] in the share price during the sell-off in October.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Our import team have put together an interesting and well-defined diversified portfolio for 3i Infrastructure.",1567
18511,"2018m11","that's all it portfolio will underpin strong NAV and dividend growth going forward.",1567
18511,"2018m11","[indiscernible] happy holders of our 33% stake.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I'd now like to close by saying a little about the shape of 3i.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As we continue to navigate the current political, economic and market uncertainties.",1567
18511,"2018m11","2018 has been a pretty interesting year in the stock market and other capital markets with 2 particularly wobbly months in March and October.",1567
18511,"2018m11","First and at risk of stating the obvious, the group looks very different today to how it looked in the last major downturn in 2007.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Our portfolio hasn't in the main being built around key secular trends.",1567
18511,"2018m11","These are our top 10 assets mapped against those trends that have been determining our capital allocation policy in recent years.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And secondly, the group itself is now built on solid conservative foundations.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We have a strong balance sheet with net cash over GBP 0.",1567
18511,"2018m11","5 billion and no outstanding funds commitment.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We now have a lean organization with around 240 people across 6 main offices and an annual cost base of approximately GBP 125 million.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And incidentally, that cost base is about what it has been for each of the last 5 years and at is 1% of AUM.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And it will be more than covered by this year's group cash income such as the dividends from 3i Infrastructure and Scandlines and third-party fees.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Whichever measure you choose, whether it's people, offices or annual costs, these overhead numbers are a fraction of what they were in 2007.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We have a people probably which is growing in EBITDA terms in the mid-teens of a base of low leverage.",1567
18511,"2018m11","In terms of geographic markets, we played to our strengths in the deepest and most liquid markets in northern Europe and North America, while governance is strong and long established local teams of brand strength give us a real competitive advantage.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We're very careful about how we buy assets and then how we mark them.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We don't do this with one eye on the next fundraising.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We are not infallible in our judgments, but we are investing with proprietary capital and are very focused on what is in the long-term interest of our shareholders.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And finally, the senior management team has seen a few economic cycles and is paranoid about downside risk.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Okay, I hope, you're as pleased with these results as we are and I'll now hand it over to Julia.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Liz Miliatis from Bank of America.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Firstly, if I may on the investment sort of the outlook for the coming few years.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It seems to pull back a bit.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Could we get a sense of how do rough -- out of the GBP 750 million maximum target would we be -- how much of that would you be aiming to spend half of the that's close to the lower -- or lower end? Thanks, Simon.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So as you just heard, this had been another good half for 3i.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Our total return of 10% on shareholder funds, yet an increase of NAV per share of 776p in the 30th of September.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That NAV increase was driven by strong portfolio performance and a tailwind that we've got from sterling weakness.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You can see here, head up NAV has been developed in the half.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You'll find the same slide in the second quarter in the pack together with the usual sensitivities for changes in FX.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Realized profits contributed 8p, and value growth added another 49p.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Simon touched on realizations, so I'll just focus on the value growth.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This slide shows you how the GBP 478 million of value growth is split between our business lines.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Action generated GBP 271 million of value growth.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That's another very strong contribution from this exceptional business.",1567
18511,"2018m11","But we also had a significant GBP 230 million positive contribution, almost all of which came from our stronger assets in the 2013/'16 and the 2016/'19 Private Equity digitized assets.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And that contribution was driven by earnings not multiples.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You heard about Schlemmer from Simon.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And that alone accounts to GBP 53 million of the GBP 84 million negative contribution.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The Infrastructure business and its portfolio also had a strong first half.",1567
18511,"2018m11","They delivered an excellent GBP 76 million of value growth from the 14% share price increase of 3iN.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You'll noticed a new corporate asset segment.",1567
18511,"2018m11","For now, corporate assets only includes a reinvestment into Scandlines.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Just to be clear, the GBP 835 million realization of our total investments in Scandlines is shown in our Private Equity business performance.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The GBP 529 million of reinvestment is in this new corporate asset segment, and I'll show you the net impact on group investments and realizations when we get to the balance sheet.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Under the care tractions of Scandlines and a screw perspective, it is strong cash generation.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Since our reinvestment in June, we have already received GBP 22 million of dividend income.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Scandlines is valued on a DCF basis, and the GBP 15 million value movement basically reflects the other side of the GBP 22 million dividend income received.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We had a good first half in Private Equity and generated an 11% growth investment return.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The realizations include the Scandlines disposal I just talked about as well as proceeds from SLR, Etanco and Basic-Fit.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The realized profits is GBP 75 million and up at the scale of 8% reflect the fact that Scandlines and SLR were valued on an imminent sales spaces at the 31st of March.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You can see here how the Private Equity portfolio value has developed since the 31st of March.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The new investments in Royal Sanders and ICE account for almost all of the GBP 254 million of new investments in the half.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The good value growth of GBP 417 million reflects the strong earnings growth of the majority of assets in our top 20 investments.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Now clearly, this demonstrates evidence of the resilience of our portfolio.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We support that resilience by not leveraging our investments too aggressively.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The average net debt and the overall portfolio was 4x at the 30th of September quarter 3.",1567
18511,"2018m11","6x if you take out Action.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Changes in net debt and earnings growth flow through to the GBP 342 million of performance that you can see on this slide.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Of the GBP 417 million total Private Equity value growth, we had only a GBP 30 million increase in value from multiple movements.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We made small increases in the multiple of 4 of our better-performing investments and evaluated average, again excluding Action, increased from 11x to 11.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And now of course, our valuations are based on equity markets on the 31st of September, and it was an interesting October.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And despite some recoveries in spend, we appear to be in another period of equity market volatility.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As I've talked about before, we have been taking a longer-term view of multiples for some time.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This means that when we set the multiples for our evaluations, not only look at what the screen tells you at that point in time, but we also look at things like longer-term sector averages, recent transactions and the level that we might expect to exit some investments at.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As a result, we have set multiples which are lower than the average comp debt in 14 as of the 22 companies that we valued on an earnings basis.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So to bring this a bit more to light, here's an illustrative version of the slide that I review when we're finalizing the value of portfolio valuations.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It shows in dark blue the multiple we're using to value a company.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And next to it, in light blue, you can see the average of the comp set.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Before I will start counting, there are 13 data sets here, and that's because I've excluded Action as you already disclose the multiple for that valuation.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This gives you a picture of the buffer that we have against market volatility.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Our approach clearly won't insulate this completely from a fundamental market shock, but it is effective in mitigating against the type of volatility that we've seen over the last few weeks.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And this is what the picture look like at the end of October.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The differences have reduced, but the shape is roughly the same.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Strong realizations and value growth play through to carried interest receivable and payable.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Carry only pays out when the relevance scheme is through to the performance hurdle and then only when cash is generated from an investment.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This GBP 37 million of cash paid in the first half relates to the Action refinancing which we completed in March 2018.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Some 30 minutes ago, we have had another very good half for our infrastructure business, with a 13% growth investment return.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As well as benefiting from strong share price performance of 3iN, our Infrastructure business is an important contributor to our cash income.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This comes from 3iN's dividends and fee income, and we were delighted that the 3iN board agreed to extend our management's agreement with them for a further 4 years to 2022.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And fee income is also increasingly coming from management fees from the infrastructure team's other fundraising initiatives.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You can see here, the increasing diversity of infrastructures asset's under management at the 30th of September, that figure is GBP 3.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The cash income from Infrastructure and Scandlines means that we have generated the cash operating profit of GBP 4 million in the first half.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Of course, GBP 4 million is a small number in absolute terms, especially compared to the realizations generated by Private Equity, but it is the critical aspects of our resilience and volatile market.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We do not want to be in a position for having to sell investments to pay the cost of running the business.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That's why we continue to focus on the cash operating profit metric.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We also want to be funded to take advantage of investments regardless of short-term realization conditions.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And that's why we maintain a conservative balance sheet.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We had a net cash of GBP 512 million at the 30th of September and liquidity of GBP 1.",1567
18511,"2018m11","But as Simon has emphasized, we would be careful about making new investments to make sure we can generate sustainable returns for our shareholders over the longer term.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We're now operating our new dividend policy.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As you will recall, intention is to have a simpler approach to dividends with the intention to maintain or grow the dividend.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And of course, that remains subject to the strength of our balance sheet and levels of investments and realizations.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The interim dividend is now a straightforward formula.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It's 50% of the prior year total dividend.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Consequently, we've confirmed today that we will pay an interim dividend of 15p.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So this has been another good half for 3i.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And despite market and political volatility, we remain focused on generating mid- to high teens returns for our shareholders.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We'll now be happy to take questions.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Well, I guess we spent about GBP 250 million so far.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That's excluding the reinvestment in Scandlines of GBP 0.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I think it's very hard to call at the moment.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We have a number of interesting processes ongoing.",1567
18511,"2018m11","They tend to be of the type that I've talked about which is additive to the current portfolio or bilateral type discussions where we're more confident about where the price may go to.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I don't think we'll hit GBP 750 million, but I think we'll do more than what we've done today, but I can't be a bit more hopeful than that.",1567
18511,"2018m11","There's a lot of uncertainties around at the moment.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I mean, let me tackle the second question first.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We don't really know where the limit for store expansion is.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We're originally targeting only about 250 stores this year, but we've decided later on in order to deal with a very busy trading in December in France to simply defer stores that are ready to open their doors but simply to open them in January so that we don't put more pressure on the supply chain in France.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I suspect the optimum numbers somewhere between 250 and 300, and that's where we'll ultimately get to but we need the supply chain in order to properly underpin that.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So that would -- that's where I think it will go to.",1567
18511,"2018m11","In terms of the new category, they've made a very good start in particular sports.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Sports is our highest selling in terms of improved category over the year and has phenomenal performance behind it.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So they've been great introductions and Bellina  clothing category focused around basics is doing much better than the broader fashion category that we had prior to that.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Iain? Final question that I received fairly often from investors is if you could give an update on Eurofund V wind up and where we're at with that.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I mean, the fundraising during the course of the year has been focused on [indiscernible] and funds.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And we're looking at other opportunities.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The business is doing very well and the franchise plays very well.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You'll have seen that we continue to invest in people in the U.",1567
18511,"2018m11",", so we expect those initiatives to play through into our numbers in due course.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We don't have the same issue in [indiscernible] which is the DC down there in [indiscernible].",1567
18511,"2018m11","Chris? And that's just a specific geographic issue there? And then another question on Action if I may.",1567
18511,"2018m11","If you could give us a bit more color on the distribution network and how it's currently operating.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Are there any issues there, perhaps what we saw mostly in France.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And potentially also what kind of supply issues have you had recently or how that's tracking as well? Okay.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I mean, Eurofund V is in its final extension period.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That extension period comes to an end at the end of November next year, and we will be winding it up at that point.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I actually feel there'll be a limited number of investments at that point, but Action will clearly be one of those.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And therefore, we're going to focus on how we deal with a combination of different positions across the LPs that make up that fund later on next year, because there are LPs in that fund who would like to reinvest in Action, so find a way of maintaining their exposure to Action.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And there are LPs in that fund who's simply timed out because they're in fund to fund or something else.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So we have to accommodate those sites in looking and a resolution of the Action position.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So it's not going to be an IPO or anything like that, but there will be a trade of some equity in Action at a point in time over the next 12 months or so.",1567
18511,"2018m11","3i won't be selling any of its stake by the way.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Any more questions? There's a Mike coming.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It's Iain Scouller from Stifel.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about the infrastructure business.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I mean, if we exclude 3i infrastructure, I mean, the assets under management changed over the last 6 to 12 months, are there any sort of plans for growth or major growth in the horizon on that business? It was very much priced in relations to what we have in our books.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Any more questions? Okay, thanks for coming this morning.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I appreciate it.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And you're not even comment in pricing presumably that's a sensitive issue? Chris Brown from JPMorgan.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Just a small question on Action again.",1567
18511,"2018m11","[indiscernible] bought a small additional stake.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Are you able to say much more about that? Yes.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We suffer -- its in a suburb of Paris.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We suffer from issues to do with absenteeism, issues to deal with strikes, issues to do with militancy and trade unions.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It's a tricky area to operate.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We have discovered there are many other DCs there are who have the same sort of issues.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So it's really about labor and labor relations frankly.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You want to do that? Sorry, another Action question.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You will introduce 2 new product lines or tweak them this year.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Can you talk about how they've been performing? And also, just 250 stores a year feel like the natural limit of expansion.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So I mean, the supply chain network, in general, works extremely well.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So we have very effective distribution centers in Holland and Germany in particular, but we do have in France 1 particular distribution center which is not able to work to the same formulas and KPIs as we see in the other distribution centers.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And an example of that is it almost takes twice as long to unload the supplier's truck in this French DC as it does in either the German or Dutch DCs.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And this causes bottlenecks within that particular DC which does feed a lot of our busiest stores in the north of France.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And as a result of that, we have not been able to provide those stores with the full catalog of goods that we have Action frequently enough.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And while the footfall going through those stores is up a similar amount to what it was up last year, basket sizes are down because of the availability of the key products.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So we're traveling at 3% like-for-like it there instead of 6% or 7% is what is occurring.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Now we've got a couple of ways around that.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We can improve the systems, the training, the leadership in that particular DC in the short term, and we can also limit the amount of stores that needs to be looked after.",1567
18511,"2018m11","But in order to do that effectively, we need to open a new DC at Leon, which we're going to do in February and we're going to open further DC in the North in the West later in 2019.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So the Pans are afoot.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I don't think it's a permanent situation, but it's taken the edge of the growth this year in what are some of our very busiest stores across the Action network.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So we're on it and we're spending a lot of money on it, but we're not quite there yet.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Another question there? James Brown from Barwon Investment Partners.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You preferred specific issues under 1 distribution center in France and the desire to open other distribution center which relieve those issues.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Can you give a bit more detail out there and why the logistics issue at that 1 DC shouldn't apply to others in France? Thanks, Simon.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So as you just heard, this has been another good half for 3i.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Our total return of 10% on shareholder funds led to an increase of NAV per share of 776p in the 30th of September.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That NAV increase was driven by strong portfolio performance and a tailwind that we got from sterling weakness.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You can see here how that NAV has developed in the half.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You'll find the same slide for the second quarter in the pack together with the usual sensitivities for changes in FX.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Realized profits contributed 8p, and value growth added another 49p.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Simon touched on the realizations, so I'll focus on the value growth.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This slide shows you how the GBP 478 million in value growth is split between our business lines.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Action generated GBP 271 million of value growth.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That's another very strong contribution from this exceptional business.",1567
18511,"2018m11","But we also had a significant GBP 230 million positive contribution, almost all of which came from our stronger assets in the 2013/'16 and the 2016/'19 Private Equity vintage assets.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And that contribution was driven by earnings, not multiples.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You heard about Schlemmer from Simon.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And that alone accounts for GBP 53 million of the GBP 84 million negative contribution.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The Infrastructure business and its portfolio also had a strong first half.",1567
18511,"2018m11","They delivered an excellent GBP 76 million of value growth from the 14% share price increase of 3iN.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You'll notice the new Corporate Asset segment.",1567
18511,"2018m11","For now, Corporate Assets only includes a reinvestment into Scandlines.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Just to be clear, the GBP 835 million realization of our total investments in Scandlines is shown in our Private Equity business performance.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The GBP 529 million of reinvestment is in this new Corporate Asset segment, and I'll show you the net impact on group investments and realizations when we get to the balance sheet.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Under the care tractions of Scandlines from a group perspective, it is strong cash generation.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Since our reinvestment in June, we have already received GBP 22 million of dividend income.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Scandlines is valued on a DCF basis, and the GBP 15 million value movement basically reflects the other side of the GBP 22 million dividend income received.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We had a good first half in Private Equity and generated an 11% growth investment return.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The realizations include the Scandlines disposal I just talked about as well as proceeds from SLR, Etanco and Basic-Fit.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The realized profits is GBP 75 million, and uplift of sale of 8% reflect the fact that Scandlines and SLR were valued on an imminent sales basis at the 31st of March.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You can see here how the Private Equity portfolio value has developed since the 31st of March.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The new investments in Royal Sanders and ICE account for almost all of the GBP 254 million of new investments in the half.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The good value growth of GBP 417 million reflects the strong earnings growth of the majority of assets in our top-20 investments.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Now clearly, does it demonstrate evidence of the resilience of our portfolio.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We support that resilience by not leveraging our investments too aggressively.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The average net debt in the overall portfolio was 4x at the 30th of September or 3.",1567
18511,"2018m11","6x if you take out Action.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Changes in net debt and earnings growth flow through to the GBP 342 million of performance that you can see on this slide.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Of the GBP 417 million total Private Equity value growth, we had only a GBP 30 million increase in value from multiple movements.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We made small increases in the multiple of 4 of our better-performing investments and evaluated average, again excluding Action, increased from 11x to 11.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Now of course, our valuations are based on equity markets on the 30th of September, and it was an interesting October.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And despite some recoveries in spend, we appear to be in another period of equity market volatility.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As I talked about before, we have been taking a longer-term view on multiples for some time.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This means that when we set the multiples for our valuations, we not only look at what the screen tells you at a point in time, but we also look at things like longer-term sector averages, recent transactions and the level that we might expect to exit an investment at.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As a result, we have set multiples which are lower than the average comp debt in 14 as with the 22 companies that we value on an earnings basis.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So to bring this a bit more to light, here's an illustrative version of the slide that I review when we're finalizing the portfolio valuations.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It shows in dark blue the multiple we're using to value a company.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And next to it, in light blue, you can see the average of the comp set.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Before anyone starts counting, there are 13 datasets here, and that's because I've excluded Action, as we already disclosed the multiple for that valuation.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This gives you a picture of the buffer that we have against market volatility.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Our approach clearly won't insulate us completely from a fundamental market shock, but it is effective in mitigating against the type of volatility that we've seen over the last few weeks.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And this is what the picture looked like at the end of October.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The differences have reduced, but the shape is roughly the same.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Strong realizations and value growth play through to carried interest receivable and payable.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Carry only pays out when the relevance scheme is through its performance hurdle and then only when cash is generated from an investment.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This GBP 37 million of cash paid in the first half relates to the Action refinancing, which we completed in March 2018.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Simon said a minute ago, we have had another very good half for our Infrastructure business with a 13% growth investment return.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As well as benefiting from strong share price performance of 3iN, our Infrastructure business is an important contributor to our cash income.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This comes from 3iN's dividends and fee income, and we were delighted that the 3iN board agreed to extend our management agreement with them for a further 4 years to 2022.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And fee income is also increasingly coming from management fees from the infrastructure team's other fundraising initiatives.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You can see here, the increasing diversity of infrastructures asset's under management.",1567
18511,"2018m11","At the 30th of September, that figure was GBP 3.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The cash income from Infrastructure and Scandlines means that we have generated the cash operating profit of GBP 4 million in the first half.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Of course, GBP 4 million is a small number in absolute terms, especially compared to the realizations generated by Private Equity, but it is a critical aspect of our resilience in volatile markets.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We do not want to be in a position of having to sell investments to pay the costs of running the business.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That's why we continue to focus on the cash operating profit metric.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We also want to be funded to take advantage of investments regardless of short-term realization conditions.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And that's why we maintain a conservative balance sheet.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We had net cash of GBP 512 million at the 30th of September and liquidity of GBP 1.",1567
18511,"2018m11","But as Simon has emphasized, we won't be careful about making new investments to make sure we can generate sustainable returns for our shareholders over the longer term.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We're now operating our new dividend policy.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As you will recall, intention is to have a simpler approach to dividends with the intention to maintain or grow the dividend.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And of course, that remains subject to the strength of the balance sheet and levels of investments and realizations.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The interim dividend is now a straightforward formula.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It's 50% of the prior year total dividend.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Consequently, we've confirmed today that we'll pay an interim dividend of 15p.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So this has been another good half for 3i.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And despite market and political volatility, we remain focused on generating mid- to high teens returns for our shareholders.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We'll now be happy to take questions.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Sorry, another Action question.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You would introduce 2 new product lines or tweak them this year.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Can you talk about how they've been performing? And also, does 250 stores a year feel sort of like a natural limit of expansion? Yes, very simply.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That was the Finance Director who moved on [ Frederick ] at the end of the summer.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We bought in his stake, but that's what that amounts to.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Well, I guess we spent about GBP 250 million so far.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That's excluding the reinvestment in Scandlines of GBP 0.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I think it's very hard to call at the moment.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We have a number of interesting processes ongoing.",1567
18511,"2018m11","They tend to be of the type that I've talked about, which is either additive to the current portfolio or bilateral type discussions where we're more confident about where the price may go to.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I don't think we'll hit GBP 750 million, but I think we'll do more than we've done today, but I can't be a lot more hopeful than that.",1567
18511,"2018m11","There's a lot of uncertainties around at the moment.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I mean, the supply chain network, in general, works extremely well.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So we have very effective distribution centers in Holland and Germany, in particular, but we do have, in France, one particular distribution center which is not able to work to the same formulas and KPIs as we see in the other distribution centers.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And an example of that is it takes almost takes twice as long to unload a supplier's truck in this French DC as it does in either the German or the Dutch DCs.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And this causes bottlenecks within that particular DC, which does feed a lot of our busiest stores in the north of France.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And as a result of that, we have not been able to provide those stores with the full catalog of goods that we have at Action frequently enough.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And while the footfall going through those stores is up a similar amount to what it was up last year, basket sizes are down because of the availability of key products.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So we're traveling at 3% like-for-like there instead of 6% or 7% is what is occurring.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Now we've got a couple of ways around that.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We can improve the systems, the training, the leadership in that particular DC in the short term, and we can also limit the amount of stores it needs to look after.",1567
18511,"2018m11","But in order to do that effectively, we need to open the new DC at Leon, which we're going to do at February, and we're going to open a further DC in the North in the West later in 2019.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So the plans are afoot.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I don't think it's a permanent situation, but it's taken the edge off the growth this year in what are some of our various busy stores across the Action network.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So we're on it, and we're spending a lot of money on it, but we're not quite there yet.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And you're not [ even comment pricing].",1567
18511,"2018m11","Presumably that's a sensitive issue.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Liz Miliatis from Bank of America.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Firstly, if I may on the investment sort of outlook over the coming few years, it seems you've pulled back a bit.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Could we get a sense of out of the GBP 750 million maximum target, would we be -- how much of that would you be aiming to spend half of it closer to the max lower -- or the lower end? Yes.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We don't have the same issue in [ Labasteed ] which is the DC down there to lose.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Chris? Okay.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Let's begin.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Good morning.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Welcome to 3i's Interim Results Presentation.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As we remind you every time we meet, our strategy aims to deliver mid- to high teens returns to our shareholders.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We do that through a combination of thoughtful capital allocation, a disciplined approach to making fee and infrastructure investments, and through solid portfolio management.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As you will have seen from the results we announced this morning, we're making good progress on all our strategic objectives, so let's look at the detail.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It's been another good half for 3i.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We've delivered a steady flow of realizations and good portfolio growth across both divisions, underpinning our returns.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We also made some attractive new investments as well as a number of bolt-on acquisitions across our portfolio.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We just need to wait for the slides to move, I'm afraid.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So another good financial results with a total return of 10% in the first half and good momentum across both portfolios.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We've taken advantage of the plentiful supply of dry powder with a decent flow of realizations of good prices.",1567
18511,"2018m11","But on the buy side, we've been careful to avoid those processes that have attracted the big spenders.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Our Private Equity team has delivered another very good return.",1567
18511,"2018m11","In general, the portfolio is developing well with good momentum in a number of our larger assets.",1567
18511,"2018m11","In the new deal market, we focused only on those assets where we have a high degree of conviction that we can meet or beat our target of 2x.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We've also recovered significant value in some of our legacy investments as well as managing excellent realizations in Scandlines and Basic-Fit.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Our portfolio has continued to perform well with good earnings growth, in particular, and few write-downs.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Apart from action in AES, the growth has all come from our recent investments, some of which are now growing very strongly.",1567
18511,"2018m11","There is one very disappointing number on the right of this page, which is frustrating.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And concerns Schlemmer, our cable protection business, the new automated sector.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Schlemmer has continued to achieve good top line growth but has struggled with its operational and procurement costs.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This has impacted cash flow and has been compounded by poor controls and problems with some legacy IT systems.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The problem boils down to weak leadership and the need to accelerate an operational improvement plan.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So over the summer, we concluded we had to change the CEO and other top managers then rebase the investment.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We now have a strong new CEO and CFO combination, and we've made a number of other senior appointments to bring Schlemmer back on track.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As I said earlier, we've continued to do careful purchases, passing on new numerous opportunities this year on price expectations alone.",1567
18511,"2018m11","In fact, we've been very surprised with some of the prices being paid for decent but unexceptional businesses.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So we've worked hard to seek out opportunities where we can exploit our competitive advantage or with straightforward acquisitions for existing portfolio companies, deliver both cash synergies and strategic benefits.",1567
18511,"2018m11","At the same time, our conviction about the quality of our current portfolio and the value of putting more resource in capital behind our winners has increased.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I remain confident that, through a combination of our geographic origination teams and established sector investments, we can continue to grow and refresh our portfolio.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Royal Sanders is an interesting example of where we have used our established portfolio to gain a competitive advantage to secure a high-quality consumer asset in The Netherlands.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Royal Sanders has a very strong track record based on the private label initiatives of the high-grade discount and convenience retail sector across Continental Europe and the U.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And the company is a key partner as a contract manufacturer for high-growth brands in Europe.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And shortly after completing the acquisition, we entered into negotiations with McBride to buy their personal care plants in the U.",1567
18511,"2018m11","and Belgium.",1567
18511,"2018m11","There is a very -- this is a very exciting development for Royal Sanders, and we hope to conclude this acquisition this month.",1567
18511,"2018m11","ICE is another good example of a thoughtful purchase.",1567
18511,"2018m11","With ICE, we focused on an asset which has few peers and is a relatively complex business.",1567
18511,"2018m11","But it's in the travel sector which we know well.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The role of ICE is to sell travel inventory to consumers via third-party loyalty programs.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And ICE has proprietary software to make it work.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Let me give you an example of what ICE does.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As I'm sure you know, the -- it is important for a cruise ship to sail with a full complement in its cabins because the cruise companies get a big part of their revenue from on-ship purchases during the cruise itself.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So the large cruise companies use ICE to sell excess cabin inventory into loyalty programs where consumers can buy cabins at opaque prices through the redemption of loyalty credits and cash.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And the newer the ship is, i.",1567
18511,"2018m11",", without an existing fan club, or the more tricky the market, the more crucial the role of ICE in dealing with that unsold inventory.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We bought both ICE and Royal Sanders at sensible prices, and they are performing ahead of our investment case.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As I said a minute ago, we've been busy with portfolio M&A across a good number of assets.",1567
18511,"2018m11","In the last 12 months alone, the total amount -- the total amounted to some EUR 375 million of enterprise value.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The majority of the acquisitions we've made have been financed by the cash flows of our portfolio companies without the need of equity from 3i, and we have a strong pipeline of further bolt-on investments going forward.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Now we signaled in May that we would target some GBP 700 million to GBP 800 million of realizations this year.",1567
18511,"2018m11","After taking account of the Scandlines reinvestment, we've already raised over GBP 500 million of that target, and we've got a number of other processes in trend.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Importantly, the realizations of recent vintage investments, Scandlines and Basic-Fit, have been made at returns significantly ahead of our 2x target.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Scandlines has been a great investment for 3i, particularly since we bought the 50% from Allianz 2013.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We're holding onto a 35% stake in the company because we are convinced about the strength of the business and its cash flows and the likelihood of further value growth over time.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Now it's been another tricky year for retailers in Europe with the continued growth of online competition, extreme weather in both winter and summer, strikes, and truck driver shortages.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And you've seen the negative impact of this across numerous retail results announcements already this year, but you won't be seeing too much of an impact on Action.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Action has contributed GBP 271 million of valuable growth in the first half, and that's been based purely on earnings growth.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Action has continued to grow strongly this year with sales to-date up about 24% over 2016.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Action's put a lot more focus this year on building solid foundations for future growth with significant investments in commercial, stock planning, distribution and supply chain capabilities.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We've recruited a new planning team as well as adding a number of real experienced people to the commercial and supply chain teams.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We've also embarked on a significant acceleration of our DC network.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We are now planning to open 3 new DCs in 2019 and a further 3 in the following 18 months.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The DC rollout is a big project that will facilitate Action's ambition to become a pan-European GBP 10 billion sales company.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Like-for-likes this year are up around 3% in all 3 of our biggest markets of Holland, France and Germany.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And I'm sure that performance compares well with other retailers in Continental Europe.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It represents continued decent performance in Holland and Germany but actually a real drop for Action's French stores.",1567
18511,"2018m11","France has remained strong but basket size has been smaller as a result of supply issues.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As we told you last May, we've struggled with operational issues in the supply chain of Action, and that has led to product availability problems, particularly in France, our largest market.",1567
18511,"2018m11","In many ways, we have an exquisite problem in France.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We have a very large number of high-performing stores with annual turnovers ranging between EUR 6 million and EUR 10 million.",1567
18511,"2018m11","EUR 3 million is the average Action store.",1567
18511,"2018m11","But these stores need considerable logistical support given the value of goods physically going through them.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And at the moment, we can't provide the time in comprehensive stock delivery as we would like.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So while like-for-likes are relatively good in France, they are clearly not as good as they could be.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Here are 2 stores that we opened in September.",1567
18511,"2018m11","One is in the south and one is in the north of France, and they're both in modest towns rather than the city.",1567
18511,"2018m11","See what I mean about footfall.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Both stores sold out almost 1/3 of their entire stock in their first day alone.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We opened a new DC at Leon in February and a further DC in Northwest France in early 2020, which will put us in a much better position to feed the high-volume French store network effectively.",1567
18511,"2018m11","In the meantime, we've decided to defer into January 2019 the opening of about 20 stores we have planned to open in France next month.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That way, we can more effectively manage our peak trading month of December in France.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We will still open some 230 stores across the Action network in 2018 once we allow for this change.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So Action is becoming a very large business.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It needs solid foundations and a resilient supply chain to really capitalize on the attraction of the format to consumers wherever it opens.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Now I'd like to turn to infrastructure, where the team is putting together another strong performance based on strong asset management, quality new investment and good AUM growth.",1567
18511,"2018m11","3i Infrastructure plc is having another good year.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It produced a 16% TSR in the first half, and we've seen barely a flicker in the share price during the selloff in October.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Our infra team have put together an interesting and well-defined diversified portfolio for 3i Infrastructure.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And that solid portfolio will underpin strong NAV and dividend growth going forward.",1567
18511,"2018m11","[Audio Gap]
happy holders of our 33% stake.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I'd now like to close by saying a little about the shape of 3i as we continue to navigate the current political, economic and market uncertainties.",1567
18511,"2018m11","2018 has been a pretty interesting year in the stock market and other capital markets with 2 particularly wobbly months in March and October.",1567
18511,"2018m11","First and at risk of stating the obvious, the group looks very different today to how it looked in the last major downturn in 2007.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Our portfolio has, in the main, been built around key secular trends.",1567
18511,"2018m11","These are our top-10 assets mapped against those trends that have been determining our capital allocation policy in recent years.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And secondly, the group itself is now built on solid conservative foundations.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We have a strong balance sheet with net cash over GBP 0.",1567
18511,"2018m11","5 billion and no outstanding funds commitments.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We now have a lean organization with around 240 people across 6 main offices and an annual cost base of approximately GBP 125 million.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And incidentally, that cost base is about what it has been for each of the last 5 years and is 1% of AUM.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And it will be more than covered by this year's group cash income, such as the dividends from 3i Infrastructure and Scandlines and third-party fees.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Whichever measure you choose, whether it's people, offices or annual costs, these overhead numbers are a fraction of what they were in 2007.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We have a PE portfolio which is growing in EBITDA terms in the mid-teens off a base of low leverage.",1567
18511,"2018m11","In terms of geographic markets, we've played to our strengths in the deepest and most liquid markets in Northern Europe and North America, where governance is strong and long-established local teams and brand strength give us a real competitive advantage.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We're very careful about how we buy assets and then how we mark them.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We don't do this with one eye on the next fundraising.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We're not infallible in our judgments, but we are investing with proprietary capital and are very focused on what is in the long-term interest of our shareholders.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And finally, the senior management team has seen a few economic cycles and is paranoid about downside risk.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Okay, I hope, you're as pleased with these results as we are and I'll now hand it over to Julia.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It's Iain Scouller from Stifel.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I was wondering if you could just talk a bit about the infrastructure business.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I mean, if we exclude 3i infrastructure, I mean, have assets under management changed over the last 6 and 12 months? And are there any sort of plans for growth or major growth on the horizon on that business? It was very much priced in relation to what we had in our books.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Any more questions? Okay, thanks for coming this morning.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Appreciate it.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Final question that I receive fairly often from investors is if we could give an update on Eurofund V windup and where we're at with that.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And that's just specific geographic issue, though? Yes.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We suffer -- its in a suburb of Paris.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We suffer from issues to do with absenteeism, issues to do with strikes, issues to do with militancy and trade unions.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It's a tricky area to operate we have discovered.",1567
18511,"2018m11","There are many other DCs there who have the same sort of issues.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So it's really about labor and labor relations, frankly.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I mean, let me tackle the second question first.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We don't really know where the limit for store expansion is.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We were originally targeting the opening of about 250 stores this year, but we've decided late on in order to deal with a very busy trading in December in France to simply defer stores that are ready to open their doors but simply to open them in January so that we don't put more pressure on the supply chain in France.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I suspect the optimum number is somewhere between 250 and 300, and that's where we'll ultimately get to, but we need the supply chain in order to properly underpin that.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So that, that would -- that's where I think it will go to.",1567
18511,"2018m11","In terms of the new categories, they've made a very good start in particular sports.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Sports is our highest selling in terms of improved category over the year and has phenomenal performance behind it.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So they've been great introductions, and Bellina  clothing category focused around basics is doing much better than the broader fashion category that we had prior to that.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Iain? Chris Brown from JPMorgan.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Just a small little question on Action again.",1567
18511,"2018m11","[ My latest view indiscernible] bought a small additional stake.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Are you able to say much more about that? And then another question on Action, if I may.",1567
18511,"2018m11","If you could give us a bit more color on the distribution network and how it's currently operating.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Are there any issues there, perhaps in what we saw in mostly in France.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And potentially also what kind of supply issues have you had recently or how that's tracking along as well? Well, yes.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I mean, the fundraising during the course of the year has been focused on [ mayor ] and [ RE ] ops funds.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And we're looking at other opportunities.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The business is doing very well and the franchise plays very well.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You'll have seen -- from us [ like to say ] we've continue to invest in people in the U.",1567
18511,"2018m11",", so we expect those initiatives to play through into our numbers in due course.",1567
18511,"2018m11","James Brown from Barwon Investment Partners.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You referred to the specific issues at the one distribution center in France and the desire to open other distribution center, which should relieve those issues.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Can you go into a bit more detail there on why the logistics issues at that 1 DC shouldn't apply to others in France? You want to do that? Okay.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I mean, Eurofund V is in its final extension period.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That extension period comes to an end at the end of November next year, and we will be winding it up at that point.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I actually feel there'll be a limited number of investments in it at that point, but Action will clearly be one of those.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And therefore, we're going to focus on how we deal with a combination of different positions across the LPs that make up that fund later on next year because there are LPs in that fund who would like to reinvest in Action, so find a way of maintaining their exposure to Action.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And there are LPs in that fund who are simply timed out because they're in a fund to fund or something else.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So we have to accommodate both sides in looking at a resolution of the Action position.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So it's not going to be an IPO or anything like that, but there will be a trade of some equity in Action at a point in time over the next 12 months or so.",1567
18511,"2018m11","3i won't be selling any of its stake, by the way.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Anymore questions? There's a mic coming.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Another question here? It was very much priced in relation to what we had in our books.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Any more questions? Okay, thanks for coming this morning.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Appreciate it.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I mean, the supply chain network, in general, works extremely well.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So we have very effective distribution centers in Holland and Germany, in particular, but we do have, in France, one particular distribution center which is not able to work to the same formulas and KPIs as we see in the other distribution centers.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And an example of that is it takes almost takes twice as long to unload a supplier's truck in this French DC as it does in either the German or the Dutch DCs.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And this causes bottlenecks within that particular DC, which does feed a lot of our busiest stores in the north of France.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And as a result of that, we have not been able to provide those stores with the full catalog of goods that we have at Action frequently enough.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And while the footfall going through those stores is up a similar amount to what it was up last year, basket sizes are down because of the availability of key products.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So we're traveling at 3% like-for-like there instead of 6% or 7% is what is occurring.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Now we've got a couple of ways around that.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We can improve the systems, the training, the leadership in that particular DC in the short term, and we can also limit the amount of stores it needs to look after.",1567
18511,"2018m11","But in order to do that effectively, we need to open the new DC at Leon, which we're going to do at February, and we're going to open a further DC in the North in the West later in 2019.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So the plans are afoot.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I don't think it's a permanent situation, but it's taken the edge off the growth this year in what are some of our various busy stores across the Action network.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So we're on it, and we're spending a lot of money on it, but we're not quite there yet.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I mean, let me tackle the second question first.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We don't really know where the limit for store expansion is.",1567

18511,"2018m11","So they've been great introductions, and Bellina  clothing category focused around basics is doing much better than the broader fashion category that we had prior to that.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Iain? Well, I guess we spent about GBP 250 million so far.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That's excluding the reinvestment in Scandlines of GBP 0.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I think it's very hard to call at the moment.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We have a number of interesting processes ongoing.",1567
18511,"2018m11","They tend to be of the type that I've talked about, which is either additive to the current portfolio or bilateral type discussions where we're more confident about where the price may go to.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I don't think we'll hit GBP 750 million, but I think we'll do more than we've done today, but I can't be a lot more hopeful than that.",1567
18511,"2018m11","There's a lot of uncertainties around at the moment.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Another question here? Okay.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I mean, Eurofund V is in its final extension period.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That extension period comes to an end at the end of November next year, and we will be winding it up at that point.",1567

18511,"2018m11","3i won't be selling any of its stake, by the way.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Anymore questions? There's a mic coming.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Yes, very simply.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That was the Finance Director who moved on, Frédéric, at the end of the summer.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We bought in his stake, but that's what that amounts to.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Chris Brown from JPMorgan.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Just a small little question on Action again.",1567
18511,"2018m11","I noticed you bought a small additional stake.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Are you able to say much more about that? And that's just specific geographic issue, though? Liz Miliatis from Bank of America.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Firstly, if I may on the investment sort of outlook over the coming few years, it seems you've pulled back a bit.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Could we get a sense of out of the GBP 750 million maximum target, would we be -- how much of that would you be aiming to spend half of it closer to the max lower -- or the lower end? You want to do that? Thanks, Simon.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So as you just heard, this has been another good half for 3i.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Our total return of 10% on shareholder funds led to an increase of NAV per share of 776p in the 30th of September.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That NAV increase was driven by strong portfolio performance and a tailwind that we got from sterling weakness.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You can see here how that NAV has developed in the half.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You'll find the same slide for the second quarter in the pack together with the usual sensitivities for changes in FX.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Realized profits contributed 8p, and value growth added another 49p.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Simon touched on the realizations, so I'll focus on the value growth.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This slide shows you how the GBP 478 million in value growth is split between our business lines.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Action generated GBP 271 million of value growth.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That's another very strong contribution from this exceptional business.",1567
18511,"2018m11","But we also had a significant GBP 230 million positive contribution, almost all of which came from our stronger assets in the 2013/'16 and the 2016/'19 Private Equity vintage assets.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And that contribution was driven by earnings, not multiples.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You heard about Schlemmer from Simon.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And that alone accounts for GBP 53 million of the GBP 84 million negative contribution.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The Infrastructure business and its portfolio also had a strong first half.",1567
18511,"2018m11","They delivered an excellent GBP 76 million of value growth from the 14% share price increase of 3iN.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You'll notice the new Corporate Asset segment.",1567
18511,"2018m11","For now, Corporate Assets only includes a reinvestment into Scandlines.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Just to be clear, the GBP 835 million realization of our total investments in Scandlines is shown in our Private Equity business performance.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The GBP 529 million of reinvestment is in this new Corporate Asset segment, and I'll show you the net impact on group investments and realizations when we get to the balance sheet.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Under the care tractions of Scandlines from a group perspective, it is strong cash generation.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Since our reinvestment in June, we have already received GBP 22 million of dividend income.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Scandlines is valued on a DCF basis, and the GBP 15 million value movement basically reflects the other side of the GBP 22 million dividend income received.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We had a good first half in Private Equity and generated an 11% growth investment return.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The realizations include the Scandlines disposal I just talked about as well as proceeds from SLR, Etanco and Basic-Fit.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The realized profits is GBP 75 million, and uplift of sale of 8% reflect the fact that Scandlines and SLR were valued on an imminent sales basis at the 31st of March.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You can see here how the Private Equity portfolio value has developed since the 31st of March.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The new investments in Royal Sanders and ICE account for almost all of the GBP 254 million of new investments in the half.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The good value growth of GBP 417 million reflects the strong earnings growth of the majority of assets in our top-20 investments.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Now clearly, does it demonstrate evidence of the resilience of our portfolio.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We support that resilience by not leveraging our investments too aggressively.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The average net debt in the overall portfolio was 4x at the 30th of September or 3.",1567
18511,"2018m11","6x if you take out Action.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Changes in net debt and earnings growth flow through to the GBP 342 million of performance that you can see on this slide.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Of the GBP 417 million total Private Equity value growth, we had only a GBP 30 million increase in value from multiple movements.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We made small increases in the multiple of 4 of our better-performing investments and evaluated average, again excluding Action, increased from 11x to 11.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Now of course, our valuations are based on equity markets on the 30th of September, and it was an interesting October.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And despite some recoveries in spend, we appear to be in another period of equity market volatility.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As I talked about before, we have been taking a longer-term view on multiples for some time.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This means that when we set the multiples for our valuations, we not only look at what the screen tells you at a point in time, but we also look at things like longer-term sector averages, recent transactions and the level that we might expect to exit an investment at.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As a result, we have set multiples which are lower than the average comp debt in 14 as with the 22 companies that we value on an earnings basis.",1567
18511,"2018m11","So to bring this a bit more to light, here's an illustrative version of the slide that I review when we're finalizing the portfolio valuations.",1567
18511,"2018m11","It shows in dark blue the multiple we're using to value a company.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And next to it, in light blue, you can see the average of the comp set.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Before anyone starts counting, there are 13 datasets here, and that's because I've excluded Action, as we already disclosed the multiple for that valuation.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This gives you a picture of the buffer that we have against market volatility.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Our approach clearly won't insulate us completely from a fundamental market shock, but it is effective in mitigating against the type of volatility that we've seen over the last few weeks.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And this is what the picture looked like at the end of October.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The differences have reduced, but the shape is roughly the same.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Strong realizations and value growth play through to carried interest receivable and payable.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Carry only pays out when the relevance scheme is through its performance hurdle and then only when cash is generated from an investment.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This GBP 37 million of cash paid in the first half relates to the Action refinancing, which we completed in March 2018.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Simon said a minute ago, we have had another very good half for our Infrastructure business with a 13% growth investment return.",1567
18511,"2018m11","As well as benefiting from strong share price performance of 3iN, our Infrastructure business is an important contributor to our cash income.",1567
18511,"2018m11","This comes from 3iN's dividends and fee income, and we were delighted that the 3iN board agreed to extend our management agreement with them for a further 4 years to 2022.",1567
18511,"2018m11","And fee income is also increasingly coming from management fees from the infrastructure team's other fundraising initiatives.",1567
18511,"2018m11","You can see here, the increasing diversity of infrastructures asset's under management.",1567
18511,"2018m11","At the 30th of September, that figure was GBP 3.",1567
18511,"2018m11","The cash income from Infrastructure and Scandlines means that we have generated the cash operating profit of GBP 4 million in the first half.",1567
18511,"2018m11","Of course, GBP 4 million is a small number in absolute terms, especially compared to the realizations generated by Private Equity, but it is a critical aspect of our resilience in volatile markets.",1567
18511,"2018m11","We do not want to be in a position of having to sell investments to pay the costs of running the business.",1567
18511,"2018m11","That's why we continue to focus on the cash operating profit metric.",1567
